People need to know who we are, what we do and where we do it. We have a good story to tell. We are committed to leveraging our global capabilities across multiple pockets of excellence to consistently deliver market-leading service. We are aware of the challenge of achieving year on year growth. Acquisitions in the past have disguised this challenge. Our investment in our identity, technology and people will position us to take advantage of the growing markets where we operate.
Returns to shareholders
Last year we stated our intention to retain the dividend at its current level for the foreseeable future so that future earnings growth will provide a more appropriate earnings dividend cover. For 2018 the final dividend is recommended to be 5.08 pence resulting in an unchanged dividend in line with the stated policy.

Our Company Secretary Nick Rowe retired at the end of December after ten years with the Group and has been replaced by David Gormley who has held a series of roles as Company Secretary of UK listed businesses.
The Board wishes to thank Robert and Nick for their dedicated service to the Group over the years.
Behaving responsibly
We work with our clients to help them deliver sustainable project outcomes that have minimal impact on the local environment. Responsibility is integral to our agreed purpose and behaviours. The Board is delighted to be continuing its commitment to Tree Aid.

As our new brand states, RPS is completely focused on making complex easy and delivering market leading results for our clients, our people and our shareholders. While the Board is very positive about the progress we are making, the progress must be reflected in our share price and much remains to be done to get to where we want to be. The Board is united in its support for the strategy and is completely focused on maintaining the pace of change and to benefit from the opportunities available.

We expect our investment in people, brand and connectivity to show a very positive return. RPS is a good business that can get better. Ongoing urbanisation and resource scarcity will ensure ongoing demand for the services we provide.
Renewed focus
Over the last 12 months we have made a clear shift from thinking of ourselves as a conglomerate of small consulting and services businesses, to being a mid-sized global firm that uses its combined expertise to deliver professional services around the world. We are good at what we do and we want to be the best mid-sized company in our industry. We want

Group prospects
The future for RPS is about being at the forefront of changing market trends, identifying growth opportunities and delivering complex solutions in a way that is easy to understand and implement. Alongside investment in our brand, 2019 will see a continuation of the focus and investment in our people, technology and innovation to build on the deep expertise that our clients have recognised us for and give us a stronger competitive edge in all the markets that we operate in. RPS is pragmatic in its aspirations and we have the capability to utilise the means available to us to achieve our goals and further strengthen the business.
Trading conditions in most of our markets appear satisfactory and supportive of organic growth although necessary investment previously announced will temper performance this year before accelerating growth in future years. The risks associated with Brexit are contained mainly within the Consulting UK and Ireland business and we have seen little impact so far. Against this background, the Board's view of the 2019 outlook for the Group is unchanged and is in line with market expectations. The transition the Group is undertaking is providing a strong foundation to deliver long term shareholder value.

The Group's principal cost is the people it employs and the matching of this cost to the workload within its various business units is also a key component of operations. This is coupled with the careful management of projects to ensure that the Group's profitability is matched by strong cash flow.
Managing and leading to accelerate growth The Group Board has overall responsibility for the stewardship of the Group. At the operational level, the Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the executive management of the Group and is supported by a settled Group Leadership Team which comprises the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, six segment CEOs, Group People Director, Group Marketing Director and the more recently appointed Chief Information Officer and Group Strategy Director.

OUR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

We want to capitalise on current and potential strengths by combining data with digital technologies and our deep expertise to collect, collate, interpret and then disseminate this data to our clients in a way that is easy to understand.

We have assembled a group of digital leaders and work is well underway towards:
·Using data and digital technologies in progressive ways to enhance client engagement and delivery

Scaling our digital advantage to deliver unique experiences that our clients value has the potential to create multiples of value and to disrupt traditional consulting pricing models.
Our goal is to embed RPS' digital advantage into every part of our business towards delivering self-sustaining, profitable business transformation.

·· Commercialising the untapped value in the data assets we hold to extend our domain expertise into new markets
·· Harnessing technology that complements and augments the services we offer to build new lines of revenue.
Our goal is to create significant value for clients, our people and shareholders as we seek to build the density of our expertise across all markets, multiplied by the power of data and digital technologies.

WHAT WE DO: We create shared understanding of complex scenarios in the real world with a digital 3D model in a virtual world.
MAKING COMPLEX EASY: Our 3D modelling services help clients and stakeholders collaborate to develop integrated solutions and communicate complex scenarios.
THE RESULT: We transform complex technical information into accurate, clear visual communications.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Performance summary

Fee income for 2018 was £574.2m (2017: £562.3m, £552.6m at constant currency), an increase of 4% at constant currency. Our PBTA was £50.2m (2017: £53.9m, £52.8m at constant currency).

The Group's results for the year are summarised in the table below:

Note 1 `A' is Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and transaction-related costs.

We believe that PBTA and operating profit before A are more representative measures of performance than statutory measures. By excluding amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and acquisition related costs (`A'), the Board has a clearer view on the performance of the Group and is better able to make operational decisions to support its strategy.

Segment underlying profit was £64.2m (2017 £68.2m) with growth in Energy and Norway, whilst Consulting UK & Ireland, North America and AAP suffered from the effects of retention and recruitment challenges. Organic initiatives, yet to produce significant returns, lessened the performance of Services UK & NL. Reorganisation costs were £1.8m compared to £1.2m in 2017, the increase mainly due to lease exit costs in Norway of £0.8m. Unallocated expenses were £8.4m, compared to £8.5m in the prior year. In 2018 we invested in Group HR, marketing and IT but incurred no significant costs associated with Board changes as we did in 2017 and bonuses were lower. Operating profit before A was £54.0m (2017: £58.5m, £57.3m at constant currency) at a margin on fees of 9.4% (2017: 10.4%).

Report and Accounts 2018

Strategic report

Economic Environment

RISK Exposure
Changes in the economic environment have historically proved to be the greatest risk to which the Group is exposed. The global financial crisis of 2008 and ensuing recession as well as the collapse of oil prices in 2015/16 both had substantive impact on parts of the Group. Adverse economic changes may cause clients to cancel, postpone or downsize projects as well as increasing risk associated with recovery of debts and work-in-progress.

Mitigation
Exposure to a wide range of markets and geographies serves to mitigate overall risk. As far as practicable, economic conditions affecting our markets are monitored in order that swift action can be taken. The contracted order book is monitored relative to the productive capacity of fee-earning staff and actions taken to match costs with anticipated workload.

Change in the year
Overall economic risks have increased during the year. In line with the stance adopted by the Trump administration in the US, the risks of a significant global trade war have increased. In addition the risk of a `hard-Brexit' and ensuing economic disruption have increased significantly.

Recruitment and Retention of Staff

The Group's ability to manage and service its clients is dependent upon the skills of well-qualified and professional employees. A failure to recruit and retain employees of appropriate calibre will therefore affect our ability to meet client expectations and develop the business. Linked to this, a failure to adequately consider management succession may lead to discontinuity in operations.

The Group retains the key strategic priority of being recognised by its people as being a great place to do great work. This entails the development of an appropriate culture and related management systems. The ongoing work in this area is fully described on pages 32 to 34 the successful completion of which will serve to substantially mitigate overall risk in this area.

The impact of staff loss from aquired businesses was felt in Consulting UK & Ireland, North America and AAP. Our staff turnover rate remained high. The competition for talent in a number of the Group's markets has remained intense. Initiatives taken to mitigate risks in this area will therefore be of continuing importance.

and plans adjusted accordingly.

Business Acquisitions

Well-planned business acquisitions continue to be an important element in support of our strategy. A failure to understand the market conditions affecting an acquired business, to identify acquired liabilities, or to retain and motivate key employees within acquired businesses can all result in a business failing to deliver anticipated profit and cash flow.

The Group's strategy will in general dictate that acquisitions are only made in market areas with which senior management are familiar. Detailed commercial, financial and legal due diligence is undertaken prior to completing any acquisition and clear corporate integration plans are agreed.

There was no change in overall risk in the year. The Group retains considerable acquisition experience and as activity in this area resumes, risks are unlikely to change materially.

Health and Safety

The Group has a legal and moral obligation to ensure the safety of its employees and others whom its activities may affect. A failure to discharge these obligations could expose individuals to risk of injury or other harm as well as leaving the Group liable to related damages, regulatory penalty and reputational harm.

Detailed health and safety policies and procedures are in place throughout the Group and focus on the differing and emerging risks within the Group's various businesses. A structured reporting process is in place to ensure that any incidents are identified and appropriate action taken to investigate and mitigate future risk. The Group's approach to health and safety is described more fully in the Corporate Social Responsibility report on page 36.

There was no overall change during the year. The scope of the Group's activities and the risks they present has not changed in any significant way.

Report and Accounts 2018

Strategic report

Regulatory and Compliance

RISK Exposure
The Group is subject to a range of legal, taxation and regulatory requirements at corporate level and within each of the jurisdictions within which it operates and does business. A failure to comply with these obligations could give rise to financial penalty, regulatory intervention and reputational damage.

Mitigation
Whilst the Group is subject to the corporate law and regulation affecting most groups of its size and complexity, the activities that the Group undertakes are, in general, not subject to industry specific regulation. Overseas projects that may carry elevated risk are scrutinised on a case by case basis. The Group has appropriate internal controls to support regulatory compliance and employs suitably qualified professionals to monitor and manage regulation within its various jurisdictions.

Change in the year
There was no overall change during the year. Whilst the detail of applicable law and regulation will continue to evolve there have been no changes anticipated within the Group's current jurisdictions which are likely to have any material effect upon overall risks in this area. Appropriate processes have been put in place to deal with the impact of GDPR. The range of jurisdictions in which project work is undertaken may change, although will remain subject to scrutiny as highlighted above.

Financial Risks

An inability to secure adequate funding for the Group will limit the ability to invest in growth. In addition a failure to manage risks related to foreign exchange, interest rates, credit and liquidity could lead to a significant deterioration in the Group's financial position.

The Group has in place a multicurrency revolving credit facility of £150m provided by Lloyds and HSBC and which expires in 2020. The Group has also issued seven year US private placement notes of US$34m and £30m repayable in 2021 under a facility provided by Prudential Management
Inc. Funding and investment requirements are monitored by the Group Finance function which also oversees the management of financial risks on a prudent basis and as more fully described in note 28 to the financial statements on page 122.

There was no overall change in the year. The Group has an adequate committed facility until 2020 and will continue to manage financial risks on a prudent basis. The refinancing of this facility is a priority for 2019 although is not expected to present undue difficulty.

Information Technology and Security Risks

A prolonged lack of availability of critical IT systems could cause significant discontinuity in operations. A cyber-related attack on our systems could lead to infection by viruses, loss of personal data and sensitive data, theft or fraud. Either eventuality could lead to operational disruption, affecting our ability to deliver client services, leading to financial loss and reputational damage.

The Group continues to manage its IT systems on a centralised basis with annual planning which incorporates measures designed to maximise reliability and resilience as well as disaster planning. Systems are reviewed and upgraded on a rolling basis. The Group employs a Security Officer and policies, procedures and security measures are reviewed and enhanced on a regular basis. The roll-out of a number of additional measures has commenced during the year including user authentication and device encryption.

There was no overall change in the year. The ongoing program of systems development should serve to improve the resilience and reliability of systems.
Notwithstanding additional measures highlighted above, the level of threat from cyber-attacks of an increasingly sophisticated nature is unlikely to diminish and must be accounted for with responsible forethought.

PEOPLE

A great place to do great work ­ one of our five strategic priorities

Creating the foundations for attracting and retaining the best people

RPS has identified the recruitment and retention of our people as a very high priority across the Group.

Our people are undeniably our greatest asset and have always been the key to our success. We want our teams to experience an environment that engages and inspires them to be their best. We want RPS to be a company where everyone can use their skills and specialist knowledge to make complex easy and solve the problems facing our changing world.

Without the right people in the right place doing the best job they can, we won't realise our full potential. In recognition of this strategic imperative we have established our first Global People Strategy. This can be summed up as making RPS a great place to do great work.
Creating a stimulating and engaging working environment

We inspire our people to deliver
our strategy

We create a high performance
culture and reward accordingly

In 2018 we conducted our inaugural global staff survey because we wanted to hear our employees' views on working life at RPS and for them to identify the issues that need to be put at the heart of our

strategy. Thanks to a fantastic response rate of 80%

we have, for the first time, a detailed picture of what

We create high performing
leadership teams

·· The effectiveness of our senior leaders and how we act more successfully on our people's ideas and opinions
·· Providing clarity on our strategy to build confidence in the direction we are taking
·· Improving levels of understanding of how people are rewarded.

We recognise potential and work in partnership to make the most of opportunity RPS established a new forum in Netherlands called Young RPS in 2018. Young RPS is for every employee under the age of 35. The group shares an online platform to keep in touch with each other, share information and arrange events where they discuss RPS' strategy and their own career development and journey at RPS.
Young RPS held its first meeting in October 2018 following the Senior Leadership Conference: sharing the highlights and priorities presented by John Douglas, Chief Executive. It also held a dedicated career development day in January 2019 to focus on employee career paths.

PROBLEMS THAT MATTER

In 2019 our behaviours will be integrated into our daily working life and form part of the fabric of key initiatives which are aimed at helping our people shine and build meaningful careers at RPS.
Diversity and inclusion As a global firm operating in 125 countries, we're as diverse as the communities and clients we represent. RPS is grounded in the belief that people should be supported to find the right position and that all interactions are based on respect, compassion and fairness. It's a view that our people share: in our global staff survey completed in 2018, 82% agreed that RPS treats employees fairly regardless of their age, gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, religion or beliefs.
RPS has continued to make progress with the female to male ratios at its most senior levels. The Group has committed to a minimum target of 25% of its Board being female. In 2017, this target was met with 33% of the Board being female and in 2018 the percentage was maintained at 33%. The Group Leadership Team, made up of 12 members, was finalised in 2018 and 33% of this group is female.

Rewarding performance
Starting with developing global reward principles to inform our decisions around reward, we are prioritising the review of our reward offering to our senior leaders. We want to ensure a pay for performance philosophy aligned to robust annual objectives that will provide focus on Absolute Delivery. We are presently reviewing the short-term and long-term incentive offering for leaders across the organisation in readiness for the full year 2019 performance period.
Investment in leadership
This year we have paid particular attention to our global leadership community. We established a global senior leadership group made up of 80 of our senior leaders around the world.

Our staff told us how important understanding the strategy, building confidence in leadership and leaders acting as role models is to them. To help our leaders support their teams in these aspects, we ran a three-day global Senior Leadership Conference for our senior leaders. This was the first time in RPS' history that a global team of this size had gathered to discuss as a community how we wanted to move the business forward. Attendees took part in a range of sessions from strategy updates to exploring, probing and contributing ideas as well as a targeted session investing in their own leadership development.
Our new organisation structure supports clients and growth
To support the restructure of our European businesses, this year we have expanded the breadth of expertise on the Group Leadership Team. We have also appointed functional leaders with global scope and we have also invested in strengthening operational teams around the world.

RESPONSIBLE RE-BRANDING
A considered and responsible approach to our re-brand
Our commitment to sustainability and ethical good practice have formed the foundation of our re-branding process.
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is critical to the safety and security of our people and we have a wide range of items that are worn day in day out by thousands of colleagues across the world. One of the biggest challenges of our responsible rebrand was how to minimise waste through out of date PPE. To do this we are working with a global network of recycling groups to dispose of `old-brand' PPE in the best ways possible. This includes shredding hi-vis jackets to manufacture insulation for sustainable building components. In the US we are working with long standing partner Green Standards on a waste diversion programme that will benefit community groups. In the UK wool clothing is being re-woven into new clothing, other materials are being shredded for vehicle insulation and we will achieve zero landfill certification through this process.

We have switched from paper business cards to digital cards. All 5,600 employees are now able to create their own digital business card. As well as making good business sense in reducing cost, we are also dramatically reducing our consumption of paper, saving half a million A4 sheets of paper in the process, making a meaningful reduction in our carbon footprint.

To mark our brand launch with employees in a responsible way, we gifted dual-wall thermal water bottles. 5,600 more people across the world are now using long lasting water bottles, instead of adding to landfill. Our supplier is regulated by not-for-profit body Sedex, working to improve ethical and responsible business practices throughout the supply chain globally.

Report of the Directors
THE BOARD

44

Report of the Directors
The Directors present their report together with the audited financial statements of RPS Group Plc and its subsidiary undertakings (the `Group') for the year ended 31 December 2018. Certain matters that would otherwise be disclosed in the Report of Directors are reported elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts. The Report of Directors should therefore be read in conjunction with the Strategic Report on pages 7 to 30, the Corporate Governance Report on pages 52 to 78 and other parts of the Report and Accounts as referred to below.
Directors
The Directors of the Company as at 31 December 2018 were those listed on pages 46 to 47. The changes to the Board that occurred in the year are as detailed on page 54. The Directors' interests in the share capital of the Company are as shown in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 69.

None of the Directors was materially interested in any significant contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries were party to during the year.
Results and dividend
The Consolidated Income Statement is set out on page 90 and shows the profit for the year. The Directors recommend a final dividend of 5.08p (2017: 5.08p) per share which, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 1 May 2019, will be paid to shareholders on 17 May 2019. This together with the interim dividend of 4.80p (2017: 4.80p) per share paid on 12 October 2018 gives a total dividend of 9.88p (2017: 9.88p) per share for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Strategic report
The Group's Strategic Report can be found on pages 7 to 30. This report is required to contain a fair review of the Company's business and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. The Strategic Report contains certain forward looking

Report and Accounts 2018

Report of the Directors

statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of RPS as well as likely future developments. These statements involve risk and uncertainty as they relate to events and depend upon circumstances that may occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. Nothing in the Strategic Report should be construed as a profit forecast.

Consistent with its size and complexity, the Group has a large number of contractual relationships with clients and suppliers. In the Directors' view, however, there is no single contract or client relationship, which is essential to the Group's business. The Group's subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 6 to the Parent Company Financial Statements. The Group develops and delivers innovative technical solutions to its clients, the costs of which are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement.

Financial key performance indicators can be found on page 5. The Directors review performance using these Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) as defined in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The APMs used exclude certain items that the Board believes distort the trading performance of the Group. These items are either acquisition and disposal related or non-cash items. The Board does not at present use non-financial key performance indicators to assess the Group as a whole, although parts of the Group do use such indicators from time to time.

The Group obtains enhanced tax relief for these costs in the United Kingdom and has adopted the RDEC (Research and Development Expenditure Credit) regime.

results and market updates
·· The recommendation and approval of dividends and other capital distributions

Annual Review During the year reviewed, a detailed report regarding the Group's systems of risk management and internal control was prepared. Having reviewed and discussed this report the Board was satisfied that these systems are effective.

Review and reporting Internal controls and in particular any failures are reported to and reviewed at Group and operating Board meetings in order that changes to systems can be implemented where required. The Audit Committee also maintains a brief to keep the overall systems of internal control under review. During the year a detailed review of the Group's system of internal control and risk management was undertaken and reviewed by the Board. The Board and the Audit Committee were satisfied that the systems in place are appropriate and effective.

The respective responsibilities of the Directors and the independent auditors in connection with the accounts are explained on pages 48 to 49 and 82 and the statement of the Directors in respect of going concern appears on page 48. The long term viability statement is set out on page 27.

Recoverability of trade receivables and accrued income The risk that trade debtors may not be collected and accrued income may not be billable and therefore be overstated in the accounts is considered by the Board at its regular meetings as part of its review of business performance.
The Committee appreciates that there is estimation applied in the recognition of revenue. However, the number of projects undertaken at any time is large and there are relatively few that are individually material. The procedures in place for recognising revenue are well established and comprehensive financial review of monthly results provides a good level of assurance.

Auditor independence
Deloitte LLP were appointed as Group Auditors in June 2012 following a tender process. As a matter of general policy, audit partners are rotated at least every five years and the Group's policy is that the Group audit appointment should be retendered at least every ten years. The current Group audit partner is Andrew Bond for whom 2018 has been his second completed audit. The Committee ensures that the Group Auditors remain independent of the Group and reviews this on an annual basis. In this regard Deloitte provide a written report to the Committee on how they comply with professional and regulatory requirements designed to ensure their independence.

Report and Accounts 2018

Corporate Governance

Internal control and audit

In addition and as part of its responsibility to ensure audit independence and objectivity, the Committee has adopted a policy in relation to the use of the Auditors for the provision of Non-Audit Services. Under the terms of this policy the provision of certain services are prohibited and include those listed below:
·· Bookkeeping services ·· Valuation services ·· Investment advisory, broker and dealing services ·· General management services ·· Preparation of financial statements ·· Design and implementation of financial systems ·· Taxation services.
Notwithstanding the general prohibition in respect of certain services, any other Non-Audit service to be provided by the Auditors requires the approval of the Group Finance Director who will in turn refer the matter to the Audit Committee should any potential for conflict exist. The split between audit and nonaudit fees for 2018 appears in note 10 on page 106.

The Committee also monitors the ongoing effectiveness of the Group's internal financial controls and risk management processes as described on page 27 as well as assisting the Board with its annual assessment of this area. Internal audit within the Group is undertaken by the Group Assurance Manager who has a dual reporting line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Group Finance Director. The Group Assurance Manager undertakes a planned programme of reviews across the Group's operations that is approved in advance by the Audit Committee. Detailed reports are produced following each review and related follow-up actions identified. Summary reports are provided to the Audit Committee for consideration. As Chairman of the Committee on an annual basis I hold a meeting with the Group Assurance Manager.
Allison Bainbridge Chair of the Audit Committee 21 February 2019

Re-appointment of auditors

63

As noted above the Audit Committee keeps the scope, cost and effectiveness of the external audit under review. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the annual audit prior to making recommendations as to the annual re-appointment of Auditors. This assessment is based upon the Committee's interactions with the external Auditors and through feedback from finance teams across the Group. The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte continue to provide an effective service across the Group and accordingly recommended to the Board that a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte as Auditors be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

John Douglas

To make tangible progress in achieving the Group's five strategic priorities.

Considerable progress has been made during the year with the launch of a new senior leadership team and the new brand providing the Group with a clear identity and appointing a new leader to revitalise the international oil and gas business. Although no acquisitions were made in North America, the Group did make two targeted acquisitions in Australia in line with its stated strategy.

Gary Young

To (a) develop a Group ERP strategy and progress its implementation (b) accelerate monthly and annual financial reporting (c) develop a personal succession plan and (d) improve the Group budget review process.

The Committee was satisfied that the overall objectives achieved 100% of target.
The targets for the introduction of the ERP and the reduction in reporting days were fully met during the year. The targets for the personal succession plan and for improving the planning and budget process are well underway and made positive progress during the period.
The Committee agreed that the personal objectives had been achieved at 85% of target.

The Committee has reviewed the overall bonus outcomes against corporate performance and believes that the bonuses earned are commensurate with the shareholder experience in 2018. Under the normal terms of the STABP 50% of bonus earned is payable in cash and 50% deferred in shares over a three year period. The award of shares is not subject to performance conditions. Both John Douglas and Gary Young have elected to take all of their bonus in the form of deferred shares.

Consideration of employee remuneration and shareholders
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee takes the views of the shareholders very seriously and these have been influential in shaping remuneration policy and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting on-going remuneration strategy and the Remuneration Committee commits to consulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes to the remuneration policy.
Employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
In setting the remuneration policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of RPS are taken into account, including any base salary increases awarded. The Remuneration Committee has not expressly sought the views of employees and no remuneration comparison measurements were used when drawing up the Policy. Through the Board, however, the Remuneration Committee is updated as to employee views on remuneration generally.

Summary of our audit approach

Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: · revenue recognition ­ accrued income cut off; and · impairment of goodwill and long lived assets. Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with same as the prior year identified with .

and any key audit matters which are the

Materiality

The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £2.5m which was determined on the basis of 5% of profit before tax, amortisation and transaction related costs (PBTA) as detailed in note 3.

Scoping

We focused our Group audit scope and work on the business units at 6 locations. Within the 6 locations, 20 business units were subject to a full audit scope, whilst the remaining 6 were subject to specified audit procedures. Our full scope audit testing and agreed upon procedures covered 97% of revenue, 94% of PBTA, and 97% of net assets.

Significant changes There have been no significant changes in our audit approach, with the exception of the removal of the in our approach recoverability of trade receivables and accrued income in the Energy segment as a key audit matter.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
In the prior year, we included the recoverability of trade receivables and accrued income in the Energy segment as a key audit matter. In the current year, this is not considered a key audit matter on the basis that we have not historically identified any material errors, combined with improved economic conditions particularly in the oil and gas sector.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - ACCRUED INCOME CUT-OFF

Key audit matter description

The Group is engaged in the provision of consultancy services through contractual arrangements with its customers. Revenue for the financial year 2018 is £637m (2017: £631m) with accrued income of £45m (2017:£39m).

ISA 240 states that when identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement due to fraud, the auditor shall, based on a presumption that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition, evaluate which types of revenue transactions or assertions give rise to such risks.

The specific key audit matter is around the recognition of accrued income on fixed fee contracts over £50,000

where the contracts remain open at year end. This risk excluded the Norwegian component where the total

value of fixed fee contracts was immaterial. There is judgement required around the recognition of the revenue

84

and its recoverability in estimating the stage of completion and the costs to complete fixed fee open contracts.

The Group's revenue recognition policy is disclosed in note 1(c).

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the design, implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the recognition of revenue (including those related to accrued income recognition specifically) for the most significant full scope components. Whilst relying on the operating effectiveness of the controls, we tested in detail a sample of accrued income and work-in-progress balances, focusing on fixed fee contracts over £50,000 by comparing them to the signed contract terms and where possible, agreeing inputs to the related time records, verifying customer acceptances, billing milestones/schedules and understanding and challenging the estimated costs to complete. In our assessment of the stage of completion, wherever possible we attended project status review meetings and observed the process in place as well as confirming status of projects. Finally, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognised against the percentage completion determined and confirmed that they agreed to the general ledger record. Based on our findings from this, we determined whether revenue recognition was appropriate.

Key observations Based on our procedures, revenue recognised in respect of accrued income for fixed fee contracts open at year end is appropriate.

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND LONG LIVED ASSETS

Key audit matter description

At 31 December 2018, the net book value of goodwill and long lived assets was £418m (2017: £424m). The associated disclosure is included in note 13, the Audit Committee Report on page 62 and the accounting policy is disclosed in note 1(e).
Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets is a key audit matter due to the quantum of the balance recorded and the number of judgements involved in assessing impairment. The trading announcement issued by the Group on 25th October 2018 also highlighted underperformance of certain segments of the Group. Finally, in the prior year an impairment charge of £40m was recorded removing any headroom in the Energy cash generating unit (CGU). Given this background, the key audit matter is pinpointed to the key assumptions in the cash flow forecasts for the Energy, Australia Asia Pacific and North America CGUs.
The Group's assessment of the carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets is based on assumptions of future cash flows, including assumptions on growth rates and the selection of appropriate discount rates.

Report and Accounts 2018

Financial statements

In respect of the key audit matter, the CGUs' cashflows are predominantly derived from outside of the European Union.

How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter

Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the design and implementation of controls over management review of goodwill and long lived assets impairment.
Our work focused on challenging management's assumptions and the appropriateness of their judgements and forecasts used as part of their value in use calculations, specifically for Energy, Australia Asia Pacific and North America CGUs.

We considered management's forecasts in light of current trading conditions by comparing it against current and historical results with particular focus on Energy, Australia Asia Pacific and North America CGUs.

In performing our procedures, we challenged management's assessment of the impact of Brexit on future cashflows by performing sensitivity analysis on the potential impact.

We used our valuation specialists to calculate an acceptable range of discount rates and compared our range to that determined by management.

We examined the short term growth rates by using market data, relevant industry data and considering historical growth rates, in order to check for any contradictory evidence. We benchmarked the long-term growth rates against external peer Group published rates and market data. We also performed sensitivity analysis on the amount and timing of cash flows. We have considered the adequacy of the associated disclosures.

Key observations Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify any impairment as at 31 December 2018.

Our application of materiality

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable

85

that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use

materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Materiality

£2,500,000 (2017: £2,600,000)

£1,250,000 (2017: £1,300,000)

Basis for determining materiality

5% of adjusted pre-tax profit, adjusted for amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and transaction related costs (PBTA). This basis is consistent with the prior year.

Materiality determined at 3% of the parent company net assets. This was then capped at 50% of Group materiality. This materiality equates to 0.5% of net assets.

Rationale for the benchmark applied

We chose this measure as it is the Group's key profit performance indicator. It is also the primary measurement used by the users of the accounts and key stakeholders to measure the performance of the Group. The Group carries a material level of intangible assets, therefore on an annual basis, the results, including the impact of amortisation and acquisitions can be significantly distorted.

Net assets has been chosen as a benchmark as it is considered the most relevant benchmark for investors and is a key driver of shareholder value.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

RPS Group Plc (the "Company") is a public company limited by shares domiciled in England under the Companies Act. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31

consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the financial statements from the date control ceases.

Laboratory testing
The Group provides Laboratory testing services and the revenue generated is recognised as samples are tested.

December 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 21 February 2019.
(a) Basis of preparation
The Group has prepared its annual financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the

(c) Revenue
Consultancy
The Group delivers consultancy services to our clients on a time and materials or fixed fee basis. In both cases, revenue is recognised over the life of the project, as the services are performed by our staff. The Group delivers services that have no alternative use to us (advice to clients, which may take the form of reports, designs, etc.) as the services are specifically tailored to each client's

Agency agreements
The Group enters into certain agreements with clients where it manages client expenditure as an agent. It is obliged to purchase third party services and recharges those costs, plus a management fee, to the client. In these cases only the management fee is recognised as revenue as it becomes due to the Group. Trade receivables, trade payables and cash related to these transactions are included in the consolidated balance sheet.

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to both years presented in these consolidated financial statements.
(b) Basis of consolidation

revenue is recognised with reference to the cost to complete the project.
Software
The Group sells licences and access to software and applications. The software may be customised by RPS for each client, and where we sell customised software we recognise revenue over the period of customisation. Access to applications is provided for a period and revenue is recognised evenly over that period.

Fee income and recharged
expenses
Revenue is classified into fee income and recharged expenses. `Fee income' represents the Group's personnel, subcontractor and equipment time and expertise sold to clients. `Recharged expenses' is the recharge of costs incidental to fulfilling the Group's contracts, for example mileage, flights, subsistence and accommodation, and subcontractor costs on which a negligible margin is earned by the Group.

directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. When the Group makes acquisitions the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The results of acquired operations are included in the

Training
The Group provides classroom, field based and online training services to clients, either on a course by course basis or through a program specifying the numbers of training days available to the client. Revenue is recognised as the courses are delivered to the clients. In some cases, subscriptions give access to training programmes and in those circumstances, revenue is recognised when the subscription is sold.
Equipment
From time to time, the Group sells pieces of equipment to clients. In these cases, revenue is recognised when control of the asset passes to the customer and we have no remaining rights over the asset.

Contract assets and liabilities
Contract assets are booked when the amount of revenue recognised on a contract exceeds the amount invoiced. Where the amount invoiced exceeds the amount of revenue recognised, the difference is booked in contract liabilities.
Financing components
The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and the payment by the customer exceeds one year. Consequently, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.

(i) Reserves

Current tax is the expected tax payable on (m) Share Scheme Trusts

The description and purpose of the Group's reserves are as follows:
Share premium Premium on shares issued in excess of nominal value, other than on shares issued in respect of acquisitions when merger relief is taken.
Merger reserve Premium on shares issued in respect of acquisitions when merger relief is taken.

the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and rules enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The

The Company administers its share plans through two Trusts - the Employee Benefit Trust and the SIP Trust. The SIP Trust is used for the HMRC-approved Share Incentive Plan and the EBT as used for all other plans. As the Company is deemed to have control of its share trusts, they are treated as subsidiaries and consolidated for the purpose of the Group accounts. The Trusts' assets (other than investments in the Company's shares), liabilities, income and expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the Group financial statements. The Trusts' investments in the Company's shares are deducted from shareholders' funds in the Group balance sheet as if they were treasury shares.

Accordingly, transaction related costs including costs of acquisition and disposal, losses on the closure of businesses and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are excluded from the Group's preferred performance measure, PBTA.
Items are treated consistently year on year, and these adjustments are also consistent with the way that performance is measured under the Group's incentive plans and its banking covenants.
Operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and transaction related costs is a derivative of PBTA. A reconciliation is shown below.

3. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES CONTINUED

Segment profit and underlying profit Segment profit is presented in our segmental disclosures. This excludes the effects of financing and amortisation which are metrics outside of the control of segment management. It also excludes unallocated expenses. Segment profit is then adjusted by excluding the costs of reorganisation to give underlying profit for the segment. This reflects the underlying trading of the business. A reconciliation between segment profit and operating profit is given in note 4.
Reorganisation costs This classification comprises costs and income arising as a consequence of reorganisation such as redundancy costs, profit or loss on disposal of plant, property and equipment, the costs of consolidating office space and rebranding costs.
Unallocated expenses Certain central costs are not allocated to the segments because they predominantly relate to the stewardship of the Group. They include the costs of the main board and the Group finance and marketing functions and related IT costs.

Revenue measures
The Group disaggregates revenue into Fee Income and Recharged Expenses. This provides insight into the performance of the business and our productive output. (See note 1(c).) This is reconciled on the face of the income statement. Fee income by segment is reconciled in note 4.
Cash flow measures
EBITDAS EBITDAS is operating profit adjusted by adding back non-cash expenses, tax and financing costs. The adjustments include interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment and transaction related costs and share scheme costs. This generates a cash-based operating profit figure which is the input into the cash flow statement. A reconciliation between Operating Profit and EBITDAS is given in note 26.
Conversion of profit into cash A key measure of the Group's cash generation is the conversion of profit into cash. This is the cash generated from operations divided by EBITDAS expressed as a percentage. This metric is used as a

measure against which the Group's long and short term performance incentive schemes are judged and reflects how much of the Group's profit has been collected as cash in the year.
Net bank borrowings Net bank borrowings is the total of cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing bank loans and finance leases. This measure gives the external indebtedness of the Group, and is an input into the leverage calculations. This is reconciled in note 26.
Leverage Leverage is the ratio of net bank borrowings plus deferred consideration to annualised EBITDAS and is one of the financial covenants included in our bank facilities.
Tax measures
We report one adjusted tax measure, which is the tax rate on PBTA ("adjusted effective tax rate"). This is the tax charge applicable to PBTA expressed as a percentage of PBTA and is set out in note 11.

The loss on disposal includes a lease which became onerous since we could no longer make economic use of part of the building in which the business was based.
Impairment of goodwill
In 2017 the Group recognised an impairment charge of £40,024,000 against the goodwill allocated to its Energy businesses in Europe and North America. No impairment charges were recognised against goodwill in 2018.

The Group operates in and is subject to income tax in many jurisdictions. The weighted average tax rate is derived by weighting the rates in those jurisdictions by the profits before tax earned there. It is sensitive to the statutory tax rates that apply in each jurisdiction and the geographic mix of profits. The statutory tax rates in our main jurisdictions were UK 19.0% (2017: 19.25%) and Australia 30% (2017: 30%). The tax rate in the US reduced to 22.5% in 2018 (2017: 38.0%) due to the reduction in the US Federal tax rate effective from 1 January 2018.
The weighted average tax rate reduced to 23.1% in 2018 (2017: 26.1% as adjusted for the impairment of goodwill which was not deductable for tax purposes) due to the reduction in the Federal tax rate effective from 1 January 2018.
The actual tax charge differs from the weighted average charge for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation:

£000s Profit/(loss) before tax Add back: impairment of goodwill Profit before tax and impairment of goodwill
Tax at the weighted average rate of 23.1% (2017: 26.1%) Effect of: Irrecoverable witholding tax suffered Impact of intercompany financing Effect of change in tax rates US repatriation tax Canadian losses not recognised Adjustments in respect of prior years Other differences Total tax expense for the year

Adjustments in respect of prior years arise when amounts of tax due calculated when tax returns are submitted differ from those estimated at the year end. The 2018 charge relates mainly to issues arising in the US.
Other differences include expenses not deductible for tax purposes such as entertaining, share scheme charges, depreciation of property, plant and equipment which do not qualify for capital allowances and transaction related costs. They also include items that are deductible for tax purposes, such as goodwill and other asset amortisation, but are not included in the income statement.

12. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Customer relationships relate to assets acquired in business combinations since 2008 and have remaining useful lives of 1-3 years.

Goodwill
No negative goodwill was recognised in 2018 or 2017. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the Groups of cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination and as a consequence of the change in segmentation of the Group (see note 4) the allocation to CGUs has been updated since 2017. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

Summary of results
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment and no impairment charge was identified.
For part of 2017, our Energy business was split into North America and European elements and those were managed separately. Consequently, goodwill was tested for two Energy CGUs in 2017.

At the end of 2017 the businesses were recombined into a global Energy business and that has been managed in that way for the whole of 2018. Goodwill has been monitored at an Energy level throughout 2018. Consequently goodwill has been tested on a global Energy basis for 2018.

Sensitivity of results to changes in estimates
The Group's CGUs all have significant headroom. The Group does not consider the change in any one key estimate that would result in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 2018 to be reasonably possible.

The Group measures the loss allowance for trade receivables as an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss (ECL). This loss is estimated using the Group's history of loss for similar assets, adjusted for the markets and territories that the trade receivable is exposed to. This takes into account current and forecast conditions. The Group has considered the potential impact of Brexit on the ECL and has deemed this to be immaterial given the Group's history of trade receivable recoveries after historical downturns.

All amounts shown under trade and other receivables fall due within one year.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short term nature and the provisions for impairment recorded against them. The individually impaired balances mainly relate to items under discussion with customers.
Certain trade receivables are past due but have not been impaired. These relate to customers where we have no concerns over the recovery of the amount due. The age of financial assets past due but not impaired is as follows:

£000s Not more than three months past due More than three months past due
No interest is charged on overdue receivables. At the year end the Group's debtor days were 50.

The principal features of the Group's borrowings are as follows:
(i) An uncommitted £3,000,000 bank overdraft facility, repayable on demand.
(ii) An uncommitted Australian Dollar denominated overdraft facility of AUD 1,500,000 repayable on demand.
(iii)The Group has one principal bank facility: a multicurrency revolving credit facility of £150,000,000 with Lloyds Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc, expiring in 2020. Term loans drawn under this facility carry interest fixed for the term of the loan equal to LIBOR (or the currency equivalent) plus a margin determined by reference to the leverage of the Group.
114 There were loans drawn totalling £32,800,000 at 31 December 2018 (2017: £41,457,000).
The facility is guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries but no security over the Group's assets exists.
(iv)In September 2014 the Group issued seven year non amortising US private placement notes of $34,070,000 and £30,000,000 with fixed interest chargeable at 3.84% and 3.98% respectively, that are repayable in September 2021. The notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries but no security over the Group's assets exists.
The carrying amounts of short term borrowings approximate their fair values, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The carrying amounts of our long term borrowings approximate fair value.

Liquidity risk
The Group has strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a country basis. The Group also considers its long-term funding requirements as part of the annual business planning cycle.

27. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME

The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes, arising from attainment of a retirement age of 67. The pensionable salary is

closed to new entrants.

the state retirement benefit.

The schemes are administered by a fund that is legally separated from the company. The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
Under the plans, the employees are entitled to post-retirement yearly instalments amounting to 66% of pensionable salary on

The schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the plans' assets and present value of the defined benefit liabilities were carried out in November 2018 for the two schemes by a qualified actuary.
The principal assumptions used for the purposes of actuarial valuation were as follows:

Discount rate Expected rate of salary increase Inflation

2018 2.60% 2.75% 2.50%

2017 2.30% 2.50% 2.25%

With the exception of the rates of pension increase all principal assumptions are the same for both schemes. The assumed rates of pension increase were 2.5% and 0% (2017: 2.25% and 0.4%).
The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:

28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts held at year end was not material.
Foreign currency sensitivity
Since the Group hedges the majority of its transactional foreign currency exposures, the sensitivity of the results to transactional foreign currency risk is not material.

(e) Credit risk
It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts. The Group does not enter into complex derivatives to manage credit risk. The Group's exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date. The Directors consider the Group's financial assets that are not impaired to be of good credit quality including those that are past due. It is Group policy, implemented locally, that receivables are only written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. This may occur if there is objective evidence of a client's financial difficulty, or if enforcement activity has been unsuccessful. See note 16 for further detail on receivables that are past due. The Group's financial assets are not secured by collateral advanced by counterparties. In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group has a broad range of clients, the largest being government agencies and departments, national water companies, multi-national oil companies or substantial utility companies. Infrequently (and generally for administrative reasons) there may be a build up of unpaid invoices. The Group does not have significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or Group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The credit risk in cash and derivatives is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit ratings.

30. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 `Financial Instruments' and `IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers' on the Group's financial statements. New accounting policies have been applied from 1 January 2018 and these are disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
IFRS 9 `Financial Instruments'
Impact of adoption
IFRS 9 was adopted without restating comparative information, in accordance with the provisions of the standard. The Group does not account using hedge accounting mechanisms, either under IAS 39 or under IFRS 9.
The only financial assets that the Group holds are trade receivables, contract assets, other receivables at amortised cost and cash, and the only financial liabilities that are held are borrowings, trade and other payables and deferred consideration. There is no change to the classification of these assets and liabilities because of the adoption of IFRS 9; they continue to be recorded at amortised cost. These assets and liabilities are held to realise cash flows at maturity. In addition, the Group holds some forward foreign exchange contracts. These are recorded at fair value through profit or loss - there is no reclassification for these contracts either. The business holds these to manage foreign exchange exposures; it is Group policy not to trade in those derivatives.
The only adjustments that have arisen on transition to IFRS 9 relate to the recognition of additional provisions against trade receivables and contract assets which represent the lifetime expected credit losses on those assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics, relating to the markets that we operate in. The Group's history of such losses has been low and we do not currently consider the potential impact of Brexit on the recovery of contract assets and trade receivables to be material. The change in valuation of those assets has been recorded as an adjustment through opening reserves.
The loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets as at 31 December 2017 reconcile to the opening loss allowances as at 1 January 2018 as follows:

£000's At 31 December 2017, calculated under IAS 39 Amounts restated through opening retained earnings Opening loss allowance as at 1 January 2018, calculated under IFRS 9 126

Contract assets 5,756 296 6,052

Trade receivables
4,847 353
5,200

The loss allowances increased by £598,000 to £11,850,000 at 31 December 2018. The reduction would have been £27,000 higher under IAS 39.

2018 205,143
(353) (296) 128 204,622

IFRS 15 `Revenue from Contracts with Customers'
Impact of adoption
After a detailed review of contracts across the Group's service lines and sectors, no IFRS 15 adjustment was identified. However, the Group has amended its revenue accounting policies to reflect the requirements of the new standard ­ see note 1 to the accounts.

31. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
On 1 February 2019 the Group acquired the business of Corview, an Australian based transport advisory consultancy for a maximum consideration of A$32.0m (£17.8m), all payable in cash. At completion the vendors received $17.6m (£9.8m) with A$4.8m (£2.7m) payable on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of completion. In the year to 30 June 2018, Corview had revenues of A$17.1m (£9.5m) and adjusted profit of A$5.1m (£2.8m).
Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the date of signing the accounts, it is not possible to give further information.

Employee Share Trusts
The assets, income and expenditure of the SIP and Employee Benefit Trust are incorporated into the Company's financial statements.
The Trusts are used to issue shares under the Group's share schemes, as described on page 98. Cash is loaned to the Trust and then used to subscribe for shares in the Company.
Financial instruments
Disclosures on financial instruments have not been included in the Company's financial statements as its consolidated financial statements include appropriate disclosures.

i Financial assets Trade debtors and other receivables are financial assets that are recognised at fair value on inception and are subsequently carried at amortised cost. They are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are taken to the profit and loss account as incurred.
ii Financial liabilities Trade creditors and other payables including bank loans are financial liabilities that are recognised at fair value on inception and are subsequently carried at amortised cost.

2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

In the course of preparing the financial statements, no judgements have been made in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, other than those involving estimations, that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Company's accounting policies various transactions and balances are valued using estimates or assumptions. Should these estimates or assumptions prove incorrect, there may be an impact on the following year's financial statements. The only source of estimation uncertainty at the end of 2018, that has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities during 2019, relates to the testing for impairment of the Company's investments.
A further impairment of the carrying value of RPS Group Plc's investment in its US sub-Group is reasonably possible in 2019.

The valuation of the investment is most sensitive to the achievement of the 2019 budget. The budget comprises forecasts of revenue, staff costs and overheads based on current and anticipated market conditions that have been considered and approved by the Board. Whilst we are able to manage staff costs, direct costs and overheads, revenue projections are inherently uncertain due to the short term nature of our order book and oil and gas market conditions.
The US business underperformed against budget in 2018 and whilst not probable, it is possible that further underperformance may occur in 2019 if expenditure by our clients reduces. Our US business may exceed budget if market conditions allow. An underperformance against budget may lead to an impairment of this asset.
The investment value associated with the US business at 31 December was £100,472,000.

3. PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS
The 2017 profit has been restated as a result of a change in the treatment of the impairment loss that the company recognised on its investment in its US subgroup. Previously this loss was recognised directly in reserves. It has now been shown as a charge to profit and loss with a corresponding transfer from the other reserve to offset the effect on the profit and loss reserve. There is no impact on 2018 opening reserves. The profit attributable to shareholders for 2017 as previously stated was £7,218,000. The restated loss for 2017 is £29,217,000.
No profit and loss account is disclosed by the Parent Company as allowed by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The remuneration of the auditors for the statutory audit of the Company was £50,000 (2017: £50,000).

The Group's investment in its US business was impaired by £7,644,000 (2017: £36,435,000). This has been recorded through the profit and loss account. The impact on the profit and loss reserve is offset by a transfer of the same amount from the other reserve. The other reserve represents profits previously recognised in a group reorganisation involving the US business.
Subsidiary undertakings
The principal activity of the majority of our trading subsidiaries is the provision of consulting services.
The following were the subsidiaries during the year. All subsidiaries are held 100% by RPS Group Plc with the exception of Delphi Group Asia PTE Limited where 85% of the ordinary share capital is held.
Shares are held directly by RPS Group Plc except where marked by an asterisk where they are held by a subsidiary undertaking.
