2.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
PPC was established in 1950 having as purpose to generate, transmit and distribute electricity throughout the Greek territory. Prior to the establishment of PPC, the right to generate, transmit and distribute electricity had been assigned by the Greek Government to private and municipal electricity companies.
PPC started its operation in 1953 by generating and selling electricity to the abovementioned private and municipal electricity companies. During the period 1957-1963, the Company acquired the above electricity companies, including the Electric Company of Athens - Piraeus Ltd, which used to service the largest urban area of Greece and was generating a significant percentage of the total electricity consumed in the Greek market.
The Laws 1559/1985 and 2244/1994, provided for a relevant exception from PPC's exclusive right in electricity generation mainly in order to give the right to industrial companies to generate electricity for their own consumption. Moreover, said legislation allowed individuals to generate electricity from renewable sources and cogeneration exclusively for commercial use.
By virtue of Law 2773/1999 concerning the liberalization of the electricity market and pursuant to the Presidential Decree 333/2000, PPC, as of January 1st 2001, was converted into a societe anonyme wholly owned by the Greek State having as main purpose the generation and supply of electricity. In December 2001, following an increase of share capital and an offering of existing shares held by the Hellenic Republic, PPC's shares were listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. In parallel, Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) were admitted to London Stock Exchange. As of November 29, 2017, at the request of the Parent Company, GDRs were deleted and their trading on the London Stock Exchange ceased. The Hellenic Republic further reduced its stake in PPC through secondary offerings in December 2002 and October 2003.
In April 2014, the Greek Biministerial committee for restructurings and privatizations decided the transfer, without consideration, of 39,440,000 ordinary shares with voting rights corresponding to 17% of the existing share capital of PPC S.A, by the Hellenic Republic to the HRADF, pursuant to the provisions of Law 3986/2011. In March 2018, a transfer of 79,165,114 PPC shares (namely 34.123%) by the Hellenic Republic to the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations S.A. (HCAP S.A.) was completed by law and without consideration, according to para. 20, article 380 of L. 4512/2018, as amended para. 1 of article 197 of L. 4389/2016. Consequently, HCAP participates directly with 34.123% in PPC's share capital and indirectly with 17% through the HRADF, which is a subsidiary of HCAP. The total voting rights of HCAP amount to 51.123%. The Greek State owns 100% of voting rights in HCAP. Based on the above, the total percentage of the Hellenic Republic remains indirectly at 51.123%.
After the spin-off of the Transmission and the Distribution segments, two 100% subsidiaries of PPC were created, namely IPTO S.A. (Independent Power Transmission Operator S.A.) and HEDNO S.A. (Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator S.A.). IPTO S.A. is responsible for the management, operation, maintenance and development of the Hellenic Electricity Transmission System and its interconnections, while HEDNO S.A. is responsible for the management, operation, development and maintenance of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network.
On June 20th 2017, the full ownership unbundling of IPTO SA was completed as provided for in articles 142 et seq. of Law 4389/2016.
Pursuant to Law 4533/2018, on June 30th 2018 the Parent Company completed the spin-off of the two branches of lignite power generation Melitis and Megalopolis and their contribution to two new 100% subsidiary companies under the trade names "LIGNITIKI MELITIS SA" and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS SA", respectively.

part A' / Company Information

2.3 OVERVIEW OF COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES

PPC is Greece's largest electricity generator and the principal supplier of electricity in Greece.

PPC holds assets in lignite mines, power generation and distribution. The installed capacity of its power plants is 11.3 GW and accounts for approximately 54.3% of the installed capacity of power stations in Greece (excluding 930 MW of its two lignite subsidiaries to be divested Lignitiki Melitis S.A. and Lignitiki Megalopolis S.A.). Its power portfolio consists of conventional thermal plants (lignite, gas and oil fired), and hydroelectric power plants, as well as Renewable Energy Sources (RES) installations. PPC is the owner of the Distribution Network (Medium and Low voltage of approximately 240,000 km and High Voltage of approximately 1,000 km) which is operated by its 100% subsidiary, the Hellenic Distribution Network Operator S.A. (HEDNO S.A.).

Specifically, in the RES sector, PPC is the first company in Greece to install RES (in 1982), and is active through its subsidiary company "PPC Renewables S.A." (PPCR), with a portfolio of wind farms, small scale hydroelectric plants and photovoltaics.

The Hellenic Electricity Transmission System, often referred to as the "Interconnected System", spreads over the mainland of Greece. The Ionian islands, along with certain Aegean islands, are also included in the Interconnected System, to which they are connected through submarine cables. In the Interconnected System, approximately one third of the generation capacity is located in northwestern Greece, in close proximity to the lignite mines, which are the primary fuel source. In the last few years, two new, state of the art gas-fired plants were constructed, namely Aliveri V and Megalopolis V, in the southern part of the Interconnected System as well as the new hydroelectric power plant of Ilarion. All remaining islands, which are referred to as the"Non-Interconnected Islands", are served by autonomous oil-fired power plants. In most of the islands, demand is also covered by RES. The largest power plants in the Non-Interconnected Islands are located in Crete and Rhodes (with total thermal capacity exceeding 1,150 MW).

In 2018, PPC's generation of 27.4 TWh coupled with the 2.4 TWh that it imported, covered 47.9% of total demand.

14

PPC's energy mix comprised of generation from lignite (40.6%), oil (16.8%), natural gas (23.2%), hydroelectric (18.5%) and renewable energy sources (0.9%).

The nearly 6.9 mil. customers of PPC, consumed 81.9% of the total electricity supplied to end-customers in Greece

in 2018.

PPC remains by far the largest private investor in the country with total investments exceeding EUR 3.4 billion during the last five years, which contribute to the renewal of its generation potential and are expected to improve significantly the financial results of the company in the coming years.

PPC is entering a new phase during which it plans to transform itself into a modern, strongly outward-looking and efficient European utility.

Within this framework, it is building strategic partnerships in Greece and abroad, investing in state of the art environmentally friendly units, with the focus being on Renewables. Until 2030 the strategic plans of the company will involve the construction and acquisition of RES with a capacity of at least 2 GW, which is translated into an increase of the respective current capacity fifteen times. In order to fulfil this goal, PPC proceeds to broad organizational changes for the dynamic development of its portfolio in RES projects. Moreover, PPC is focused on investments on Distribution Network projects given their stable return. Furthermore, it aims at being active in new products and services and in particular in Natural Gas.

For further information regarding definitions of ratios included in abovementioned figures, please refer to the Financial Report for the twelve - month period ended December 31, 2018 (Report of the Board of Directors ­ Appendix) The operational profitability of 2018 has been positively impacted by the significant improvement of  198.6 m due to reversal of bad debt provisions for electricity customers (reversal by  169.7 m in 2018 compared to provisions of  28.9 m in 2017) and the decrease in payroll by  21.4 m. Furthermore, profitability was positively impacted by a  157.2 m reduction of the electricity suppliers' charge for the Special Account for Renewables compared to 2017. This charge was abolished as of 1.1.2019. A rebate for PPC, which is estimated to be in the order of  100 m., is expected from the surplus of the Special Account for Renewables, that had been created at the end of 2018. Finally, there was a positive effect from the decrease of net financial expenses by  16.8 m. due to the reduction of gross debt. On the other hand, there was a negative impact from turnover reduction by  201.8 m or 4.1% due to market share loss and the reduction in domestic electricity demand. Furthermore, there was a significant negative impact from exogenous factors and specifically from the higher expenditure for CO emission rights (by  137.9 m.) as well as from the notably higher net impact from "NOME" auctions (by  151.6 m.), with the impact from both these factors intensifying in the second half of 2018. Results for 2018 were negatively impacted by an additional provision of  109.5 m, for overdue interest that IPTO claims from PPC due to its participation in the wholesale electricity market, out of which  78.7 m through an extrajudicial document and  30.8 m. through lawsuits. The respective amount in 2017 was  32.7 m. The above factors led to the reduction of EBITDA to  260.1 m in 2018 compared to  469 m in 2017, that is a reduction by 44.5% or  208.9 m.

On top of the above, the Group's results for 2018 have been impacted from the following one-offs:

- the provision for personnel's severance payment amounting to  148.8 m which corresponds to the present

value of the obligation undertaken by PPC and its subsidiary HEDNO due to the abolition since April 2018 (L.

4533/2018) of the offsetting of employees' severance payment amounting to  15,000 in case of termination

of their contract with the one­off allowance to which employees are entitled to by the relevant insurance

organization (negative impact)

- the final settlement of the Renewables levy (ETMEAR) for the years 2012, 2013 and 2016, amounting to  105.2

m. (positive impact)

38

Regarding 2017 results, these have been positively impacted by the one off revenue of  359.8 m. for PSOs for the years

2012-2016.

Including the above mentioned one-offs, 2018 EBITDA amounted to  216.5 m. compared to  828.8 m in 2017.

Pre - tax losses, excluding the above mentioned one-offs, amounted to  465.5 m compared to  214.5 m in 2017.

Including one-offs, pre - tax losses, amounted to 509.1 m. compared to net income of  145.3 in 2017, while net loss

amounted to  542 m. compared to net income  127.6 m., respectively.

ANALYSIS OF REVENUES ­ OPERATIONAL EXPENSES Revenues In 2018, turnover decreased by  201.8 m. or 4.1% due to lower revenues from electricity sales by  335.4 m or 7.3%, as a result of market share loss and the reduction in domestic electricity demand. Domestic electricity demand decreased by 1.2% to 57,122 GWh compared to 57,845 GWh in 2017. However, total electricity demand (including pumping and exports) marked an increase in 2018 by 2.2% due to increased exports from third parties by 75.2% through interconnections in northern Greece. This increase in exports is mainly attributed to the export of quantities acquired by third parties through "NOME".

PPC's average retail market share in the country, declined to 81.9% in 2018, compared to 86.7% in 2017. In particular, the average retail market share in the Interconnected System was contained to 80.3% in December 2018 from 85.4% in December 2017, while PPC's average market share, per voltage, was 97.6% in High Voltage, 68% in Medium Voltage and 82.1% in Low Voltage compared to 97.3%, 71.5% and 88.5% in December 2017, respectively. As a result of the reduction of market share and lower demand, PPC electricity sales decreased by 6.6% in 2018.

Operating Expenses Operating expenses before depreciation excluding for 2018 the one ­ off impact from the provision for the personnel's severance payment as well as the final settlement of the Renewables levy (ETMEAR) and for 2017 the revenue from PSOs for previous years (2012-2016), marked a slight increase by  7.1 m. as presented below.

Operating data (generation ­ imports) PPC's electricity generation and imports covered 47.9% of total demand in 2018 (44.3% in the Interconnected System), while the corresponding percentage in 2017 was 49.4% (45.6% in the Interconnected System). PPC's market share in electricity generation, as a percentage of the total load of the Interconnected System was 40.1% in 2018 compared to 42.2% in 2017.
Specifically, PPC's electricity generation decreased by 779 GWh (2.8%), which was mainly attributed to the decreased natural gas fired units' generation by 16.9% (1,294 GWh) as well as lignite fired units' generation by 7% (840 GWh) unlike hydro generation which in 2018 increased by 46.2% (1,595 GWh) compared to 2017, due to higher hydro inflows in the Reservoirs of Hydro Power Plants.
Electricity imports in the country increased by 23.6% or by 2,143 GWh, out of which 506 GWh by PPC (21.4% market share) and 1,637 GWh by Third Parties (78.6% market share).
Energy mix expenditure Expenditure for liquid fuel, natural gas, third parties fossil fuel, CO energy purchases and for the Special Lignite Levy increased by  115.7 m. (3.8%) compared to 2017.
In detail: - Liquid fuel expense marginally increased by  8.6 m. (1.3%), from  650.9 m. in 2017 to  659.5 m. in 2018 since despite decreased consumption of liquid fuel in the Non Interconnected Islands due to the Cyclades interconnection, both heavy fuel oil and diesel prices were increased by 19.5% and 10.4% respectively. It is noted that the relevant expense in 2017 was negatively impacted by an amount of approximately  30 m. due to the operation of the natural gas fired units of Komotini and Lavrio IV with oil, in order to address the energy crisis in the winter period of 2017, a cost for which PPC has not been compensated yet.
- Natural gas expense, despite the increase of its price by 9.3%, decreased by 6.2% to  383.6 m. from  409.1 m. in 2017 mainly due to the decrease of natural gas electricity generation.
- Energy purchases expense from the System (mainland) and the Network (non-interconnected islands) decreased by only  13.1 m. to  1,711.9 m. because despite the lower volume of energy purchases by 14.8% and the lower expense from the additional charge of electricity suppliers for the Special Account for Renewables (which amounted to  196.3 m. in 2018 compared to  353.5 m. in 2017), there was an increase in the System Marginal Price (SMP) (from  54.7/MWh to  60.4/MWh) as well as a higher negative impact from "NOME" auctions. Specifically, this negative impact amounted to  223.8 m. for 2018, an increase of  151.6 m. compared to 2017. The negative effect from "NOME" intensified in the second half of 2018 with the impact amounting to  178.1 m. compared to  45.7 m. in the first half, while it is worth noting that in several cases the "NOME" quantities exceeded the sum of PPC's lignite and hydro generation, something which is expected to be the case also in 2019.
- Expenditure for CO emission rights increased to  279.5 m. compared to  141.6 m. in 2017 due to the increase in the CO emission rights' average price from  5.71/tn to  11.93/tn, despite lower emissions (23.4 m. tones compared to 24.8 m. tones). It is noted that for 2018, as a result of the acquisition in advance of certain CO emission rights, the average price was contained to a lower level compared to the average spot price ( 15.89/tn).

Payroll cost Total payroll cost including capitalized expense decreased by  23.6 m. to  790.5 m. in 2018 from  814.1 m. in 2017, as a result of natural attrition.
Provisions In 2018 the Company's actions for the improvement of collection led to the decrease of overdue receivables and the reversal of bad debt provisions for electricity customers by  169.7 m., whereas in 2017 bad debt provisions stood at  28.9 m. Such development had a positive impact of  198.6 m. on 2018 results. Provisions for litigation and slow moving materials, amounted to  114.3 m. compared to  50.3 m. in 2017, due to the  109.5 m. provision, for overdue interest that IPTO claims from PPC.
Financial expenses In 2018, net financial expenses decreased by  16.8 m. and settled at  79.3 m., due to the reduction of gross debt from  4,304.5 m. on December 31st 2017 to  4,023.7 m. on December 31st 2018.
CAPEX Capital expenditure, amounted to  746.7 m. in 2018 compared to  410.7 m. in 2017. This increase is mainly attributed to increased Generation capex for the construction of the "Ptolemais V" unit (by  280 m. approximately), the increase in RES capex amounting to  50 m. as well as the increased capex in the Distribution Network. Distribution Network capex also includes investments financed by consumers for their connection to the network, which for 2018 amounted to  61.9 m. compared to  55.6 m. in 2017.
The composition of main capex is as follows:

MAJOR RISKS - UNCERTAINTIES

46

The Group's and the Parent Company's activities are subject to various risks. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial position or operational

results and cash flows. The risks described below are not the only ones that the Group and the Parent Company

face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Group and the Parent Company or that are

currently deemed to be of minor importance may also have a materially adverse effect on the Group's and the

Parent Company's financial position, business, operational results and cash flows.

Macroeconomic conditions in Greece The Group's and Parent Company's operations, their operating results, their financial position and their prospects depend to a large extent on the macroeconomic and microeconomic environment in Greece, as virtually all their assets and activities are in Greece. Any negative change and development in the macro and micro-economic environment of the country that directly and to a significant extent affects consumer demand for electricity, the ability of customers to repay their debts, the ability of the company to pass on increases in its costs to invoices, or financing prospekts from the domestic financial system, therefore affects the operating results, financial position and cash flows of the Group and the Parent Company .

Credit Risk Despite the fact that, electricity sales are dispersed over a large number of customers with a wide range of operations, spreading credit risk, the Group's and the Parent Company's business activities, operational results and cash flows are dependent on their customers' ability to repay their debts. The current economic environment and the wide and protracted recession of recent years have had a significant adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity, mainly resulting from:

· Difficulties in payment by customers who continue to fail to meet their obligations. · A sizeable number mainly of small and medium sized companies that cease their operations due to the
economic conjecture, leaving their electricity bills unpaid. · The prospective increase of the Social Residential Tariff (SRT) beneficiaries, due to the protracted recession,
along with the increased difficulty that these customers face in paying their electricity bills. · The inability (following RAE's Decision) to transfer debts of the same customer between their various
electricity bills for household use, which accounts for 70% of the customers. · Incidents where customers (both household and commercial) with debts due to electricity consumption
or electricity theft, attempt to change their electricity supplier under a different name (or a different Tax Identification Number) in order to avoid restrictions that the Electricity Code imposes. · The fact that some customers under the pretext of the current economic downturn do not fulfill their obligations or delay their payments, despite the fact that they afford to do so. · Some (Medium and High Voltage) industrial customers do not fully pay their electricity bills, mainly claiming lack of liquidity due to the unfavorable economic climate. · In addition, some of these industrial customers have questioned charges relating to HV tariffs. It can not be guaranteed with certainty that these customers will pay for invoiced amounts related to electricity consumption.
Additionally, the Parent Company's collection enforcement mechanisms may be affected by legislation or other administrative acts, (for example by restricting disconnections for non-payment of electricity bills for certain categories of customers or in areas that are declared to be in an emergency state, where customers benefiting from such decisions stop paying their bills).
In December 2017, after a competition, the project of debts management was assigned to a specialized Agency. The project is in full swing with satisfactory results. A plan of actions to be implemented with scaling, consistency and continuity has been proposed in order to ensure the effectiveness of the actions to reduce outstanding debts. However, credit risk persists, due to the financial difficulty of some of the customers to timely repay their obligations, and ultimately will adversely affect the Parent Company's operations, operating results, financial position and cash flows.
Liquidity Risk The macroeconomic and financial environment in Greece remains volatile and that may have a considerable adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business activities, financial position and prospects. In addition, access to foreign financial markets is affected. Liquidity risk is connected with the need to ensure adequate cash flows to finance the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, as well as servicing their debt.
The Group's and the Parent Company's working capital needs may increase due to a number of factors, including: · The increased delays in the payment or even non-payment of electricity bills, especially among customers
whith ceased power supply. · The obligation to pay Renewables levy (ETMEAR), Special Consumption Tax on electricity as well as VAT
when due, irrespective of whether relevant amounts have been collected from the Group's and the Parent Company's customers. · The burden associated with the collection of taxes and levies that are not related to the sale of electricity, such as municipal taxes and levies that are currently collected through electricity bills and the inability to pay for the electricity consumption amounts without paying in the same time amounts due to third parties. · The continuous increase in the number of disadvantaged citizens included in the register of vulnerable customers that based on decisions of the State enjoy special privileges regarding (a) a longer period for paying their bills (40 days from the date of issue). b) the settlement of their debts in many installments and free of interest; c) limited penalties in the case of non-payment of bills and installments, since the supply of electricity cannot be disconnected due to debt, in their residence, almost throughout the year.

part ' / Financial Report

· Regulatory measures on the operation of the wholesale market, which burden the cost of purchasing electricity for PPC as a Supplier.
· The potential increase of commercial losses (non-technical losses), due to the non-suppression of incidents of electricity theft and arbitrary reconnection of electricity supply in cases of electricity disconnection due to debt.

The above factors may have a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity as well as their ability to finance new or ongoing projects. It should also be noted that the Group's and the Parent Company's borrowing costs to access and find liquidity (to refinance existing debt and / or new liquidity) on both domestic and international level are affected by the state of the Greek economy in recent years.

Risk from exposure to the Banking Sector The Group and the Parent Company may be exposed to risks arising for the Greek banking sector (for example limitations effected by the Single Supervising Mechanism (SSM) of the ECB on loans for Public Entities). It should be noted that as of December 31st 2018 the Group's and the Parent Company's debt obligations towards the Greek banking sector amounted to 34.1% of its total loan liabilities.

Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk The Group's and the Parent Company's debt liabilities consist of bank loans, bonds and overdrafts. It is the Group's and the Parent Company's policy to have a balanced distribution in their loan portfolio between fixed and variable interest rates according to the prevailing conditions and to hedge on a case by case basis through derivatives, solely to mitigate risk, against the fluctuation of floating interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates affecting their debt portfolio. As of December 31 st 2018 no derivative transactions exist for loans or debt hedging.

Furthermore, the fluctuation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely impact the prices of

the Parent Company's liquid fuel purchases (diesel and heavy fuel oil). As oil prices are expressed in U.S. dollars,

the Parent Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the event of an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against

48

the euro. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from liquid fuel purchases, the Parent Company examines the possibility of undertaking, on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing market liquidity

circumstances, hedging transactions for this risk. It should be noted that any undertaken hedging transactions

may not provide full or adequate protection against these risks.

Credit Rating Risk The Group's and the Parent Company's ability to access capital markets and other forms of financing (or refinancing), and the costs associated with such activities, depend in part on their credit rating which is closely related to that of the Greek State as well as to the Greek banking sector's credit rating.

In the event that the Group's and the Parent Company's credit or debt ratings are not sustained or are lowered by the rating agencies, the Group and the Parent Company may not be able to raise additional capital on terms similar to their existing loan liabilities or at all, and their ability to access credit and bond markets as well as other forms of financing (or refinancing) could be limited or impossible.

Commodity price risk and risk from the Electricity Market The Parent Company is exposed to the risk of an increase in prices of oil, natural gas, electricity purchased from the System and the Network, as well as electricity prices of direct PPC imports. The Parent Company has established a policy of oil hedging transactions, based on which the implementation of specific hedging

transactions is decided on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing circumstances. It should be noted that any undertaken hedging transactions, may not provide full or adequate protection against this risk. Currently no derivative transactions exist to hedge against oil, gas and electricity prices volatility. Moreover, the Parent Company has not established a hedging policy against the risk arising from the volatility of natural gas prices.
In terms of the risk arising from increased electricity purchase prices, exposure is hedged less and less by the Parent Company's vertical integration (internal hedge), since PPC's average share in the wholesale market as of December 31st 2018 amounted to 50.8%, while at the same period, PPC Supply's average share in the retail market amounted to 80.4%.
Additionally, prices of the main materials (metals, etc.), besides fuel, used by the Group and the Parent Company for their operation and development are determined on the international commodity markets, resulting to the Group's and the Parent Company's exposure to the risk of fluctuation of the relevant prices as well as to foreign currency risk, since no policy has been implemented to manage this risk.
CO Emission Rights The Group's and Parent Company's generation business is subject to EU Directives 2003/87/EC and 2009/29/ EC, which established the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). In order to operate its bound thermal power plants, PPC is required to acquire and deliver CO emission rights under the EU ETS (the "EU Allowances" or "EUAs") to cover CO emissions.
At European Union (EU) level, the reformation of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has now been completed in its next phase (2021-2030). The results of this review, as well as the already adopted regulatory changes in the second phase (2013-2020) of EU ETS (ie the backloading of a specific amount of CO allowances at the beginning of the period 2013 - 2020 and the creation of a market stability reserve) to control the supply of rights applicable from 2019) affect the price of emission allowances.
CO emission rights may be further affected by the possible adjustment of the European Union (EU) targets for pollutant emissions in 2030, which is part of its commitments under the Paris Agreement, the ongoing dialogue on the objectives of the EU's climate for 2050 as well as the proposed upgrading of the EU's renewable energy and energy efficiency targets for 2030 as agreed by the European Council in October 2014.
Since 2013, PPC is no longer allocated free CO emission rights (with the exception of small quantities corresponding to thermal power generation for district heating) and as its thermal power plants currently emit 30 Mt of CO approximately on an annual basis (of which about 6 Mt. concern the dinvestment of PPC's lignite capacity according to L. 4533/2018), increased prices of CO emission rights will affect its operating costs. For the period from 2013 to 2020, the Parent Company acquires the required CO emission rights from both the European and international markets, either through exchange transactions or through bilateral agreements. Regarding the management of the risks of increasing the price of emission allowances and changing the regulatory framework, the Parent Company systematically monitors markets and developments at European level and has adopted a market policy that partly offset the risk of price change while there also is an automatic mechanism (clause) for passing on increases in the price of CO allowances to Medium and High tariffs. However, an important part of the risk is not offset and therefore any increase in the price of the allowances may (directly or indirectly) affect the financial position, operating results and liquidity of the Group and the Parent Company, since the change in the price of the allowances affects only the medium and high voltage tariffs of the Parent Company.

part ' / Financial Report

Risk of exposure in competition in the wholesale market The Parent Company faces intense competition in the wholesale market where share loss is due to IPPs' power plants and the increased penetration of Renewables units in the System and the Network, as well as to increased electricity imports from the neighboring countries. In the current situation of very low gas prices and very low wholesale electricity prices in most energy Exchanges in neighboring countries, competition in the wholesale market in Greece is very strong, with high loading of the gas fueled thermal units and a very high volume of electricity imports. Adverse changes in the competitive environment through the continuation of existing and/ or creation of new regulatory or / and legislative mechanisms in the electricity market which strengthen the Group's competitors may have a negative impact on its operational results and liquidity.

Since the forthcoming changes to the wholesale energy market model are not currently final and the fact that some of the RAE decisions are transitional, the evolution of the electricity market is volatile, with a number of new regulatory decisions and other developments in anticipation, which may have a negative impact on PPC's operations as well as its financial position.

Tariff risk for the competitive activities Excluding vulnerable customers, all other tariffs are fully liberalized.

However a number of factors affect the Parent Company's ability and freedom to formulate the competitive component of tariffs, such as the ability of customers to cope with new possibly increased tariffs, initiatives of the Greek Government, decisions of the Regulator etc., especially in view of the current socioeconomic condition in Greece.

Therefore, the Parent Company may face difficulties incorporating a potentially increased commodity cost, as well as costs related to electricity and CO emission rights to electricity bills, through increased tariffs.

Despite the deregulation of tariffs, and also due to the fact that in the recent past there have been legal and

administrative actions against the Parent Company by some High Voltage customers, both in terms of structure,

50

value and terms of payment of its tariffs, the Parent Company's ability to determine its tariffs may continue to be limited in the future. If these ongoing petitions are not resolved in favor of the Parent Company, its failure to

determine its invoices without further legal complaints could adversely affect its operations, its financial position

and its operating results.

Risk from regulated rates of return on Network activities The regulated rates of return on Network investments combined with the approved by the RAE asset base on which depreciation and returns are calculated, may have a negative impact on the Groups' profitability and value, if they do not provide for a reasonable return on the invested capital and an adequate additional incentive for future strategic investments.

As a result, any changes in regulated charges that may affect the Group's operating income from electricity distribution could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations and financial position, as well as to hamper the Group's ability to raise equity or loans for funding its investment plans.

Finally, since recovery of regulated returns is based on unit charges for consumers defined by decisions of the Regulatory Authority for Energy, there is a risk that part of the return may not be fully recovered.

Regulatory Risk The legislative and regulatory framework, as well as the policies of Greece and the EU, affects the operations, the financial situation and the operating results of the Group and the Parent Company. The regulatory framework for the Greek electricity market has changed significantly following the implementation of regulatory and legal reforms aimed at liberalizing the electricity market and creating more competition in the Greek electricity market. The European Commission is monitoring developments in Greece to ensure that the Greek regulatory framework and the electricity market comply with current electricity directives and other EU laws and regulations. The European Commission and other EU institutions, as well as the national courts promote the enforcement of European competition rules, environmental protection and other regulatory provisions. The European Commission may at any time adopt additional regulations and the Greek legislative and regulatory framework may change in the future in accordance with the decisions of the EU institutions in relation to the relevant directives, laws and regulations. In addition, future changes to EU or Greek government policy, including, for example, insufficient liberalization in the electricity market, may affect the future regulatory framework. Potential modifications to the regulatory and legislative framework governing the market for electricity, such as the implementation of the EU legislative framework, as well as RAE's decisions on the regulation and operation of the Greek E / E market in general and any restructuring or other changes in the operations of the Group and the Parent Company, which are caused by the regulatory framework, may have significant negative effects on their business, their financial condition and their operating results.
Risk from providing Public Service Obligations (PSOs) The PSOs for which the Parent Company is entitled to compensation relate to:
a) the supply of electricity to the Non-Interconnected Islands (NII) at the same tariffs as those in the Interconnected System,
b) the supply of electricity at special rates to families with more than three children, c) the supply of electricity to the beneficiaries of the Social Residential Tariff ("SRT") which is currently provided
to persons of low income, families with three or more children, long-term unemployed, people with special needs and people on life support and d) the supply of electricity at special rates to public welfare entities.
PSO compensation is based on the relevant costs incurred by PPC and other electricity suppliers providing PSOs and is calculated according to a methodology published by RAE's Decisions.
Possible changes in the compensation rights for existing PSOs provided by PPC or changes in the methodology for calculating the compensation for the provision of PSOs that will not allow PPC to recover all its costs, or any partial compensation and also delays in payment of past years' PSOs, or any possible adoption of new PSOs for which PPC will not be entitled to full compensation, will have a negative impact on cost, financial position, operating results and cash of Group and the Parent Company.
Risk of deficit in the Special Account for Renewables The deficit of ex-EMO (currently DAPEEP) for Renewables which is due to the fact that the total income of the relevant Renewables account with ex-EMO (currently DAPEEP) does not cover the regulated fixed feed-in tariff paid to Renewables producers creates uncertainty and related cash flow issues in the market. The primary sources of income for this account are the amounts that Suppliers pay for Renewables generated electricity, the special Renewables levy paid by Customers (ETMEAR), which as already mentioned limits their ability for the timely payment of their electricity bills and various other smaller amounts according to the relevant legislation.

part ' / Financial Report

Due to the fact that zero deficit was not achieved, according to the provisions of Article 23 of Law 4414/2016 (New operating aid scheme for RES and CHP- Cogeneration Heat Power) a new charge was imposed on Load Representatives (electricity suppliers), in order for the deficit of ex-EMO (currently DAPEEP)'s RES Account to be reduced to zero by the end of 2017.

The above charge burdened significantly the financial results and cash flows of the Parent Company and the Group during the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, while it was already abolished as of January 1st 2019 by Law 4585/2018, since the increase in the marginal price and the CO emission allowance prices (which affect the income of the Special Account) led to a surplus.

There is also no assurance that the Greek State will not further increase the cost of purchasing Renewables energy by Suppliers in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial position.

Risk relating to Forward Electricity Products Auctions Under the provisions of Law 4336/2015, PPC's market share both in the wholesale electricity market as well as in the retail electricity market should be reduced as from January 1st 2020 no company must generate or import ­directly or indirectly- more than 50% of the total energy quantity in Greece. The Competition Commission will assess the possibility of achieving the above mentioned objective by January 1st 2019 and in case of failure to achieve it, will propose appropriate measures. In case of the companies' non-compliance, fines amounting to 5% up to 10% on the annual turnover of the previous year will be imposed. The Group and the Paren't Company cannot offer any assurance that the reduction to mandatory levels of both percentages will be achieved by the required deadline.

Laws 4389/2016 and 4472/2017 and Decisions 35/2016, 38/2016, 58/2017, 68/2017, 77/2018 and 85/2018 of

the Government's Council for the Economic Policy determine PPC's share market levels in the retail market for

the period 2016 ­ 2019 (87.24% for 2016, 75.24% for 2017, 62.24% for 2018 and 49.24% for 2019), as well as the

other key features of NOME auctions, including the cost elements to be taken into account for the calculation of

52

the auction start price.

It should be pointed out that in the context of the changes in the Greek energy market and the transition from the current Mandatory Pool model to the Target Model it is contemplated by the aforementioned decisions of the Government's Council for the Economic Policy that the Special Purpose Regulatory Mechanism (NOME) has been designed in a way as to be applicable irrespective of the underlying regulatory framework.Beneficiaries of forward products would be licensed suppliers (which would be registered in a special register solely for forward electricity products purposes) with the exception of PPC and other industrial electricity consumers. More specifically, industrial electricity consumers may not buy forward products unless they maintain or develop a separate electricity supply activity.

The quantities, the price and the other characteristics of regulated forward electricity products auctions have a significant impact on the financial position, operating results, liquidity and prospects of the Parent Company. Especially in terms of quantities - and despite the fact that Law 4389/2016 provided for the quantities of forward electricity products to be auctioned each year to be a percentage of the annual demand of 8% for 2016, 12% for 2017, 13% for 2018 and 13% for 2019, Law 4472/2017 eventually establishes increased annual quantities of forward electricity products to be auctioned : 16% of the annual demand for 2017, 19% for 2018 and 22% for 2019. These increased quantities are valid provided that the annual target of PPC's market share decrease as provided by Law 4389/2016 is met, while if PPC's market share exceeds the annual target by more than two (2) percentage points, then the annual quantities to be auctioned will increase accordingly, which may have a particularly adverse effect on the liquidity, the financial results and the prospects of the Parent Company.

Already, additional quantities have been put up for auction under a correction mechanism due to PPC's nonreduction of market share in the retail market of the Interconnected System. In June 2018 and on the basis of Law 4549/2018 for the correction mechanism for additional quantities of electricity to be auctioned, the additional

quantities decreased by 50% due to the announcement of the international tender for the disintegration of approximately 40% of the lignite capacity of PPC. If the procedures of the international tender result in the nomination of preferred investors and Sales and Purchase (SPAs) Agreements are signed with them, then the correction mechanism for additional quantities of electricity to be auctioned will be abolished.
Unless there are reforms in the regulatory framework to ensure the correction of existing distortions in the wholesale market, setting conditions of healthy competition and balanced development of suppliers in the market and promotion of competitive tariffs, a further increase in the competition in the supply electricity sector could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, prospects, financial position and results of operations.
Similarly the Group and the Parent Company is adversely affected since the price of forward products, as is set within the relevant auctions, does not cover the full cost of electricity generation but only part of these costs. This risk appears particularly high, since the already set starting auction price for auctions is based only on variable cost of lignite and hydroelectric production, and specifically only on the variable costs of lignite mines, so the remaining fixed costs cannot be recovered through auctions (capital costs, salaries, depreciation, etc. of the production units and lignite mines). Finally, since the sale price of forward products, as this is set within the relevant actions, is less than the System Marginal Price (Day Ahead Schedule there are significant revenue losses, and as a result the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial condition, operating results and prospects are adversely impacted.
Risk relating to structural measures for the divestment of lignite-fired units According to the Decision 57/19.05.2017 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy, on "The structural measures for PPC's access to lignite" and in compliance with the decisions C (2008) 824 and C (2009) 6244 of the European Commission on PPC's monopoly access to lignite, which became irreversible after the (2016) 733 and (2016) 748 decisions of the General Court of the European Union, Greece will propose to the Commission's Directorate General for Competition (DG Comp.) binding remedial structural measures based on the following principles:
a. The measures will include PPC's disinvestment of lignite power generating units to existing or new alternative suppliers or other investors.
b. PPC S.A. will not have any involvement or connection with any element of disinvestment, including preferential electricity supply. The purchaser (s) : · will be independent of and will not have any association with PPC and its affiliated companies · will have the financial resources, proven know-how and incentive to maintain and develop the disinvested portfolio of power generating stations as a viable and active competitive power in relation to PPC S.A. and other competitors. · on the basis of the information available, they would not cause or threaten to cause prima facie competition concerns and they would not create a risk of delay in the implementation of the structural measures.
c. The disinvestment will account for about 40% of PPC's lignite power generating capacity. The exact percentage will be determined during technical discussions with the European Commission in accordance with the abovementioned decisions (the disinvestment will include the associated lignite reserves).
d. The disinvestment will have equivalent economic characteristics to PPC's lignite power generating capacity, particularly in terms of efficiency and life, reflecting the start and end of lignite power generating capacity.
e. The measures will be designed and implemented in accordance with the applicable and substantive competition rules. They will be finalized through the formal submission of the agreed binding proposal by the Hellenic Republic to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition until November 2017 and will be implemented by June 2018.
part ' / Financial Report

This obligation of the Hellenic Republic was also included in the Supplementary Memorandum of Understanding agreed and signed in July 2017 by the Hellenic Republic and the European Commission on behalf of the European Stability Mechanism.

In this context, in January 2018, the Hellenic Republic proposed to the European Commission's DirectorateGeneral for Competition as a binding structural measure the disinvestment of three (3) existing lignite units of PPC, namely Meliti 1 (330 MW installed capacity), Megalopolis 3 (300 MW) and Megalopolis 4 (300 MW), as well as the production license for a new lignite unit (Meliti 2, 450 MW), together with the exploration and exploitation rights of the respective lignite mines (Megalopolis mine for the units Megalopoli 3 and 4 and the mines Kleidi, Meliti hills and Vevi for Meliti).

The Directorate-General for Competition conducted a market test for the aforementioned commitment of the Hellenic Republic. In addition, following the above, the Greek Parliament on April 25th 2018 passed the legislative provisions entitled "Structural measures for access to lignite and the further opening of the wholesale electricity market and other provisions" (L.4533/2018, OG A 75/27.4.2018), which defines the process of the spin-off and contribution of two (2) lignite sectors of PPC SA in two (2) new companies (one in Meliti and one in Megalopolis), the framework of the international tender procedure for the sale of the shares that PPC SA will take over, the responsibility of PPC SA for the two (2) new companies and, the employment relations of the employees in the two (2) new companies. Following the relevant decisions of the Board of Directors and the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders of PPC on June 26th 2018, the two Notarial Acts for the formation of Sociétés Anonymes were signed by the contribution of the decommissioned PPC Branches, and on June 30th 2018 the registrations were announced in the General Commercial Registry (GEMI) of the establishment of the two new 100% subsidiary companies of PPC SA «LIGNITIKI MELITIS SA» and «LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS SA».

The international tender provided by the Law was launched on May 31st 2018 with the publication by PPC of

a call for expressions of interest, in which a total of 6 companies responded, which were assessed as fulfilling

the pre-selected criteria, qualified as Eligible Participants and received the Call for Tender and therefore were

invited to submit their binding offers for the acquisition of 100% of PPC's shareholding in the share capital of the

54

subsidiaries "Lignitiki Melitis SA" and / or "Lignitiki Megalopolis SA". Following the formation of a consortium between 2 of the Participants during the tender process, 3 interested parties eventually became active. The

deadline for the submission of tenders was finally set at February 6th 2019, the date on which 2 of the 3 interested

parties submitted a binding bid. Of these offers, one was considered ineligible as it did not meet the criteria of

the Call to Tender, while the second was judged to be economically unprofitable by PPC's Board of Directors.

Following the above, the relevant tender process was declared barren.

On March 7th 2019 the Hellenic Parliament voted and on March 9th 2019 Law 4602/2019 was published (G.O. A' 45), which amended and supplemented the Law 4533/2018. With the new provisions, PPC is invited to call for a repeat competitive bidding process, inviting the candidates who participated in the previous tender procedure and other investors who wish to show interest in the acquisition within 7 days of the invitation of the shares of "Lignitiki Megalopolis SA" and / or "Lignitiki Melitis SA". Pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of the Law, on the basis of a relevant decision of its Board of Directors, PPC on March 8th 2019 proceeded to post on its website the Joint Call for Expressions of Interest & Call to Submit Binding Tenders, inviting investors to initially express interest to take part in the tender procedure until March 15th 2019. They will then sign a Confidentiality Convention, gain access to the Virtual Data Room (VDR), and conduct due diligence in order to reach bids, while in the meantime they must provide the necessary supporting documents to prove the fulfillment of the technical, financial and legal criteria set out, which are the same as those set out in the previous procedure. Moreover, Law 4602/2019 provides that the contract for the purchase of the shares of each new company is legally validated, while regarding the estimation of the value of the new companies there is a change in the

provision of Law 4533/2018, and PPC may designate a valuator to determine a fair value range of the market value of each of the sectors contributed. In this case, the appraiser shall take into account the corresponding trade exchanges on the European market and the results of the previous tender. On the contrary, PPC SA is required to designate a valuer in order to obtain a fairness opinion, and appraiser does not have to take into account any assessment made under the preceding paragraph.
The above mentioned structural measures may have a significant impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's operation, contractual obligations, liquidity and financial results.
Finally, there can be no assurance that the Parent Company will not be required to proceed to further disinvestments in lignite (or other) power production in the future in order to comply with its obligation to reduce its market share in the production and supply of electricity.
In addition, the Parent Company is not in a position to influence the price at which these assets will be sold.
Risk from the absence of Fixed Asset insurance Currently, the Group and the Parent Company do not maintain insurance against the usual risks associated with their power plants, distribution assets, property and equipment. Only major information technology equipment is insured. Moreover, materials and spare parts as well as liabilities against third parties are not insured. This has been primarily due to the high costs associated with obtaining insurance against these risks compared to the cost for remediating the damage should any of these risks occur, and the dispersed network of power plants.
Additionally, the Group does not insure third party liabilities with respect to distribution networks. During construction, major assets (except for networks) are insured by EPC contractors for their construction period. Cash in offices and agencies or in transfer is insured against theft and transports of liquid fuels are also insured.
Any severe damage to key power plants, distribution assets or mining equipment could have a significant adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, interruptions due to labor disputes, strikes, earthquakes, fires and adverse weather conditions, among other factors, may, depending on their severity and duration, lead to a loss of revenue or an increase in operating costs.
Hydrologic Conditions The evolution of hydrologic conditions is a completely unpredictable factor and has a very significant impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's profitability, taking into account, of course, that PPC has an accumulated experience and expertise that allows managing in the best possible way the water resources in its reservoirs.
Lignite mining risks and availability of lignite reserves Lignite mining is subject to inherent risks and is dependent upon a number of conditions beyond the Group's and the Parent Company's control that can affect costs and production schedules at particular mines.
While the Parent Company estimates that lignite reserves are adequate to cover long term levels of supply required for power generation by lignite-fired thermal power plants, such estimates may lack complete precision and depend to some extent on statistical and geological inferences. Furthermore exploitable reserves are not considered as such unless they can be economically and legally extracted.

part ' / Financial Report

Increased production costs, increased stripping ratios, changes in the regulatory regime governing the Parent Company's mining operations, the adoption of political decisions both by the EU and Greece, contributing to the reduction of the country's carbon footprint and the reduction of the exploitation of fossil fuels to generate electricity, the significant decline in oil prices and consequently natural gas prices and the increase in the price of CO emission rights burdening lignite fired electricity plants costs may result from time to time in a revision of reserve data or may render exploitable reserves uneconomical to exploit or unexploitable in the future.

Restrictions imposed by national legislation on the Parent Company's ability for new recruitments may result in the future in a shortage of skilled and qualified personnel in mining operations to operate and support its equipment and may adversely affect lignite production through the Parent Company's own resources.

Risk of dependence on the Transmission System The transfer of electricity from the power plants to the distribution networks depends on the installations of the electricity system in Greece. The Group and the Parent Company no longer control the operation of the transmission system and rely on IPTO, which manages and operates the electricity system in the Greek Territory. Possible failures of the transmission system, including those due to natural disasters and inadequate maintenance or development, may hinder the distribution of electricity from the plants to final consumers and adversely affect business activity, operating results and the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company.

Risk associated with the operation and production capacity of the Non-Interconnected Islands Network (NII)

The needs of Non-Interconnected Islands (NII) are served by stand-alone power plants using oil as fuel, although

to a certain extent these needs are also covered by renewable energy installations.

In order to meet the demand for electricity in the NII, especially during the summer months that there is an

increase in the consumption of electricity due to the tourist movement, the Group and the Parent Company may

lease or transfer production capacity (via generating sets ) from one island to another, when required.

The same process, lease or transfer of production capacity is also followed when demand in an NII cannot be met

due to an unexpected, major damage and only for the time it takes to restore it.

The Group and the Parent Company are not in a position to guarantee that there will be no future damages or

56

functional weaknesses in the Non-Interconnected Islands Network or that they will be able to meet the demand for electricity in the event of such events occurring.

Any failure to operate or reduced production capacity on the Non-Interconnected Islands Network may have a

negative impact on business activity, financial condition and operating results, as well as on the reputation of the

Group and the Parent Company.

EPC related risks The Group and the Parent Company face risks relating to the construction of electricity generation units, including risks relating to the availability of equipment from reliable suppliers, availability of building materials and key components, availability of key personnel, delays in construction timetables and completion of the projects within budget and to required specifications. They may also encounter various setbacks such as adverse weather conditions, difficulties in connecting to electricity transmission grids, construction defects, delivery failures by suppliers, unexpected delays in obtaining zoning and other permits and authorizations or legal actions brought by third parties.

Additionally, adverse macroeconomic developments, as well as financial or operating problems of main suppliers and contractors especially after the imposition of capital controls, may have an adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to purchase liquid fuels, spare parts and materials, as well as finding sufficiently competitive conditions in the domestic market and have engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") contracts completed in a timely manner and may increase the Group's and the Parent Company's operating and maintenance costs as well as planning times.

Risk from Potential Undertaking of Social Security Liabilities Despite the fact that under the current legislation the Group and the Parent Company do not have any obligation to cover in the future any deficit whatsoever between income and expenses (deficit) to PPC's personnel Social Security Funds, there can be no assurance that this regime will not change in the future.
Litigations Risk The Group and the Parent Company are involved in several legal proceedings arising from their operations, and any adverse outcome against PPC or any other of the Group's companies may have a negative impact on their business, financial condition and reputation.
In addition, as a majority state owned utility, the Group is subject to laws, rules and regulations designed to protect the public interest, such as of public procurement or environmental protection. Violation of such legislation, entails, among others, criminal sanctions for the Board of Directors members and executive officers as well as the employees of the companies and utilities that are subject to those rules.
Simultaneously, the Group is one of the largest industrial groups in Greece, with complex activities and operations across the country. In the ordinary course of its business, from time to time, competitors, suppliers, customers, owners of property adjacent to the Group's properties, the media, activists, and ordinary citizens, raise complaints (even to public prosecutors) about the Group's operations and activities, to the extent they feel that such activities and operations cause or are likely to cause economic damage to their views and/or interests, businesses or properties and, in the context of advancing those complaints, they often file criminal complaints against the Group. In this context, reports involving complaints and accusations for allegedly unlawful acts of executives against the Group usually involve their further investigation by the Prosecuting Authorities in the so-called preliminary proceedings, which usually ends up in the closing of the investigated case due to lack of conclusive evidence.
These practices have intensified during the recent economic crisis, as public prosecutors and the general public have generally become more sensitive to similar allegations, especially against companies in which the Hellenic Republic is a major shareholder and are viewed as operating in the public interest.
As a result, the Group and the Parent Company, their Board of Directors members and directors, are at present and could be in the future, subject to various criminal or other investigations at various stages of procedural advancement on a variety of grounds arising in connection with their activities in the ordinary course of business. These investigations and legal proceedings may be disruptive to the Group's and the Parent Company's daily operations to the extent that the officers and directors involved need to spend time and resources in connection therewith. They may also adversely affect the Group's and the Parent Company's reputation, although to date, none of the proceedings initiated against the Group and the Group's officers or directors has resulted in any criminal convictions.
Risk from tax and other regulations The taxation regime for corporations in Greece is frequently revised and the Group may be subject in the future to increased taxation rates. The imposition of any new taxes, or changing interpretations or application of tax regulations by the tax authorities as well as the harmonization of Greek and EU tax law and regulation may result in additional amounts being payable by the Group and the Parent Company, which could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Parent Company pays a special levy for the development of areas where electricity is generated from lignite, equal to 0.5% of its annual turnover which from January 1st 2019 is replaced by the special fee for lignite exploration and exploitation rights of 1.40  / MWh of lignite energy produced.

part ' / Financial Report

Since 2012 and until December 31st 2018, the Parent Company has been subject to a special levy for lignite generated electricity equal to 2.00 / MWh and a special tax on natural gas.

Currently, the Group does not pay any royalty, concession fee or other fee for lignite extraction or for water used on its hydropower plants. The application of any new royalty regime may require the abolishment of the current regime and the Group cannot guarantee that any form of royalties, concession fees or other fees on its lignite or hydropower production will not be introduced by the Greek Government in the future.

Due to the current recession in Greece, even if the effect of any new taxes, levies, etc. is passed onto the Group's and the Parent Company's customers, such taxes, levies, etc. may impact collection rates for PPC's electricity bills or result in a loss of market share due to competition. Conversely, if the Group and the Parent Company do not increase tariffs to match an increase in taxation, an adverse impact on their financial results and liquidity may follow.

The Group and PPC are subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to companies of the broader public sector As long as the Hellenic Republic, directly or indirectly, holds 51% of its share capital, the Company shall, in some respects, continue to be considered a public sector company in Greece. Therefore, its operations shall continue to be subject to certain laws and regulations generally applicable to public sector, affecting thus specific procedures, including but not limited to personnel salaries, maximum level of salaries, recruitments of employees, as well as the procurement policies etc.

The said laws and regulations, particularly within the framework of the current financial conjecture and the relevant decisions of the Central Administration, which are not expected to be applicable to the Parent Company's current and future competitors, may limit the Parent Company's operational flexibility and may also have significant negative impact on its financial results, cash flow and on business risk management.

It should be noted that the Group did not have for several years (till today) the ability to recruit experienced

58

personnel in the range of its business activities while, today's average personnel age is approximately 52 years. The Group's inability to recruit specialized personnel negatively affects the ability of the new PPC Group to

elaborate and implement its strategy in the new competitive and financial environment, as well as to adequately

staff basic supportive operations at the level of new subsidiaries. Finally, there is a risk of losing managers and

experienced personnel to the competition mainly because of restrictions on remuneration policies.

The viability and development of PPC Group in the new business environment notably depend on the ability to attract and maintain skilled and specialized personnel and executives. According to L. 3833/2010 and L.4057/2012, concerning the recruiting of permanent staff an approval of the Interministerial Committee is necessary (AIC 33/2006), as well as an allocative act of the Minister of the Interiors and Administrative reorganization according to the 1:4 ratio (a recruitment for every four employees leaving) for the year 2017 and 1:3 for the year 2018 concerning all public sector entities .By the above mentioned and introduced by law hiring procedure, the Parent Company's recruitment needs are significantly hindered, creating critical lack of personnel and managers and may have a negative impact on the implementation of the Groups' activity.

Finally, from August 8th 2016, Law 4412/08.08.2016 (Public Works Contracts, Supplies and Services) entered into force and applies, in accordance with the procedures specifically provided for therein, to the procedures for concluding and implementing projects, supplies and services of PPC.

As the activities of the PPC Group fall within the scope of the activities covered by this law, PPC's "Regulation of Contracts, Supplies and Services (Decision of the Board of Directors 206/30.09.2008)" is included in the repealed provisions, some provisions remain to be clarified through New Ministerial Decisions, new procedures for the

publication and implementation of tender procedures are established (for example, a Preliminary Appeal Review Authority has been established to hear preliminary rulings against PPC executives in relation to the competition procedures, and then in case of dispute by one of the parties to the decision of the Authority, the administrative courts are involved) there may be delays in the awarding of contracts, thus adversely affecting the smooth functioning of the Group and Parent Company and malfunctions in the performance of their activities.
The Group may face strikes Most of the Group's and the Parent Company's employees are members of labor unions. Extensive labor unrest may have a significant negative impact on the Group's business activity.
Health, Safety and Environmental Laws and Regulations The Group's and the Parent Company's operations are subject to National as well as European laws and regulations regarding their employees and the subcontractors employees' health and safety as well as environmental issues.
The cost for complying with such legislation and regulations may require major investments and/or significant expenses for actions regarding the environmental compliance, upgrade and rehabilitation. Changes in the environmental legislation may increase the compliance cost and eventually, may have an impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's profitability as well as its cash flow program, although compliance cost for health and safety rules is relatively low.
Furthermore, due to the nature of their operations, the Group and the Parent Company are involved in a number of environmental proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may not involve financial penalties and therefore cannot be quantified. The Group is also involved in court cases raised from victims of serious work-related accidents or from the families of deceased persons. Future related costs as a result of enforcement actions and/or third party claims for environmental damage and/or insurance cost for environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, results of operations and financial position.
The Group and the Parent Company are also required to obtain environmental and safety permits for their operations from various governmental authorities. Certain permits require periodic renewal or review of their environmental terms as well as continuous monitoring and reporting of compliance with such terms.
The Group and the Parent Company cannot give any assurance that they will be able to renew environmental permits or that material changes to their permits requiring significant expenditures on its end will not be imposed.
Environmental, health and safety laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent over time. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company may not at all times be in full compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
Additionally, as an owner and operator of generation and distribution facilities, the Group and the Parent Company may incur in the future costs and expenses in connection with the decommissioning of such facilities, which the Group and the Parent Company estimate to be to a large extent recoverable from the sale of decommissioned equipment, materials and scrap.

part ' / Financial Report

Information Technology (IT) security A large portion of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations are based on information systems; therefore they are exposed to the risk of non-availability, data integrity corruption and unauthorized access to these systems. In order to minimize these risks, the Group and the Parent Company take measures for the enhancement of their IT security.

The Group and the Parent Company believe that they currently have adequate security policies in place to cover risks associated with the operation and maintenance of their IT infrastructure and perform regular audits of their systems.

However, there can be no assurances that they will be able to prevent technology failures or IT security breaches in a timely manner or continue to have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for related losses (including litigation claims, liability and data loss), which could disrupt their operations or harm their reputation and have a materially adverse effect on their business.

In addition, with regard to the risk of cyber-attacks, the Group and the Parent Company take the appropriate measures that are constantly updated to avoid this risk, and so to this day there has not been anything wrong with their systems. However, it cannot be ruled out that a serious episode of cyber-attack will occur with adverse effects on the systems and operation of the Group and the Parent Company.

Risk of non-compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")

The new GDPR was entered into force in the European Union on May 24th 2018. GDPR sets stricter operational

requirements for the processing and management of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures

on how to use personal information, restrictions on information retention, mandatory discloses in case of data

breaches and higher standards for data controllers to be able to demonstrate that they have received valid

consent for certain data processing activities. Although the Group and the Parent Company have taken all

necessary steps to comply with the above guidelines, they are active in a sector where the processing of a

significant amount of personal data is necessary and therefore inevitably are more exposed to the risk of being

60

imposed with penalties for non-compliance with the above Regulation. Failure to comply with the applicable data collection and privacy provisions or other applicable data security standards may result in fines, penalties,

limitations, and legal disputes.

Any failure to adequately address privacy concerns (even unfounded) or non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations and privacy policies or personal data may lead to additional costs and civil liability, damage to reputation and to negatively affect the business activities of the Group and the Parent Company.

Extraordinary events Unexpected events, including natural disasters, fires, war, terrorist activities, strikes, etc., may lead to a breakdown or the interruption of the operation of the Group's and the Parent Company's mines, the generation function and electricity transmission and distribution. Additionally, adverse macroeconomic developments, as well as financial and operating problems of basic suppliers, service providers and contractors may have a negative impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to purchase liquid fuels, spare parts and materials and may increase their operating costs.

The Group's and the Parent Company's operations are susceptible to industrial accidents, and employees or third parties may suffer bodily injury or death as a result of such accidents. In particular, while the Group and the Parent Company believe that their equipment has been well designed and manufactured and is subject to rigorous quality control tests, quality assurance tests, and is in compliance with applicable health and safety standards and regulation, the design and manufacturing process is ultimately controlled by their equipment suppliers or manufacturers or EPC contractors rather than by them, and there can be no assurance that accidents

will not result during the installation or operation of this equipment. Furthermore, the consequences of these events may create significant and long-lasting environmental or health hazards and pollution and may be harmful or a nuisance to neighboring residents. The Group and the Parent Company may be required to pay damages or fines, clean up environmental damage or dismantle power plants in order to comply with environmental or health and safety regulations.
The Group and the Parent Company may also face civil liabilities or fines in the ordinary course of their business as a result of damages to third parties caused by the natural and man-made disasters mentioned above. These liabilities may result in the Group and the Parent Company being required to make indemnification payments in accordance with applicable laws.
Licensing Risk The procedures for obtaining and renewing authorizations and permits for the Group's and the Parent Company's activities can be protracted and complex. Obtaining these authorizations is not routine and the conditions attached to obtaining them are subject to change and may not be predictable. As a result, the Group and the Parent Company may incur significant expenses in order to comply with the requirements associated with obtaining or renewing these authorizations. Failure to obtain or renew the necessary licenses and permits might result in interruptions to some of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including also the ability to obtain funding for their activities.
Any failure to obtain, maintain, renew or extend all the administrative authorizations and licenses necessary for the operation of their business and execution of their strategy, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's business, strategic and financial planning, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
Risk management The Group has defined the risk as a set of uncertain and unpredictable conditions that may have an overall adverse effect on its activities, business performance, economic performance, and the implementation of the strategy and the achievement of its objectives.
The Risk Management, Planning and Control Division is organizationally provided in the Parent Company's organization chart but has not yet been staffed in the Risk Management Division as a result of a lack of appropriate staff due to a reduction in recruitment and other negative factors mentioned in the previous section. To date, executives are involved in the process of identifying and prioritizing risk, as appropriate, in order to advise the Board of Directors on the design and adoption of specific Risk Management processes and policies. The Group and the Parent Company are not in a position to guarantee that these procedures and policies provide full protection against the risks they face.

Sustainability Issues Governance and Operational Framework The PPC Board of Directors has appointed two of its members to be in charge of managing sustainable development issues. In addition, it has set up the Corporate Social Responsibility Section as a part of the Corporate Affairs and Communications Department. Its mission is to establish, develop and implement a Corporate Social Responsibility strategy that aims to meet the needs of stakeholders in a balanced manner, while highlighting the actions and practices that show the Company's social face. The Code of Corporate Governance provides a framework of principles and procedures that the Corporate Governance System of the Company follows as regards management, shareholders, its Internal Audit System and risk management. The Internal Audit Department, in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, inter alia, controls, evaluates and submits proposals regarding the Company's exposure to the risk of fraud and on the existing methods of fraud detection and prevention. Since 2017, the position of Director of Regulatory Compliance was established. Its responsibilities include, among others, the following: · Establishment of communication procedures for Regulatory Compliance and Business Code of Conduct
issues, and management of an appropriate whistleblowing channel and non-compliance reported incidents in general. · Determining the training needs and in collaboration with the Training Department, develop the training programs ensuring that employees are always informed and trained on the Regulatory Compliance and Business Code of Conduct issues. The Staff Regulations of PPC (SR/ PPC) regulates, inter alia, the rights and obligations of employees, the terms of employment contracts, the relationships formed in the execution of work and the exercise of disciplinary power. PPC implements a Training Management System for identifying and analyzing training needs, designing training courses, selecting trainees and instructors, running training courses, and evaluating training activities (the training cycle). Furthermore, PPC has developed quality, health and safety, and environmental management systems, which have been certified respectively according to ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001, aiming at its optimal operation.

Materiality Analysis PPC monitors international trends on how sustainable development is being managed and strives to improve its own performance, to ensure greater transparency in procedures and to ensure accountability. With that in mind, given that the heart of revisions to the GRI Guidelines is that each company must identify and evaluate its material aspects, in late 2018- early 2019 PPC's carried out a sustainability materiality analysis for the fourth time by engaging the Senior Management and its Stakeholders.
Material topics identified by Management PPC has developed a sustainability materiality analysis process as part of its risk identification and assessment process. However, here it does not identify operational or financial risks, but sustainability risks / impacts.
The materiality heatmaps emerged from this process show the estimated impacts/risks together with the likelihood of them occurring. The heatmaps, the findings and conclusions derived from them and the dynamic tool used to formulate and process the results of this process were then evaluated by the Company's Management team to devise policies and take decisions.
Material topics identified by stakeholders PPC acknowledges that its business operations and decision affect and are affected by different groups of stakeholders. PPC contacted its stakeholders using an online questionnaire, asking them to evaluat/score what were in their opinion the PPC's sustainability material topics. After a period of around 1 month when the questionnaire was open, PPC had collected 1,706 responses from all stakeholder groups from all regions of Greece.
Presentation of the material topics The results presented in the following diagram illustrate the issues identified in the period 2018-2019.

PPC's approach to material topics

Material topic: 1. Financial position/performance PPC's financial performance was indicated as a material topic primarily by Management, partners and suppliers, employees and competitors. It is a key priority for Management. The Company's financial data is available in this Financial Report.

Material topic: 3. New markets and investments Both PPC and stakeholders have identified and agreed that key material topics for the Company's sustainable development are the investments made and expansion into new markets. Generally speaking, PPC's strategic goal (which it is working intensively on) is to offset domestic losses due to the market liberalisation measures imposed on it, by expanding into fresh markets and capitalising on business partnerships.

Material topic: 4. Regulatory issues Management and Company competitors have recognised PPC's involvement in managing regulatory issues as a material topic of its operations. Further market deregulation has created uncertainties and challenges for PPC, and the Company considers that the need to generate results when it comes to regulatory issues will intensify.

Material topic: 5. Risk/crisis management Risk/crisis management was primarily selected as a material topic by Company Management, employees, shareholders and investors, partners and suppliers, competitors, and by non-governmental/ non-profit organisations. PPC's Management has made concerted efforts to recognise, prevent and manage risks and crises in good time. PPC's Board of Directors then examines the key risks PPC faces and refers to them in detail in the Board of Directors' Annual Financial Report.

72

Material topic: 7.

New energy market conditions

Management and shareholders and investors at PPC identify managing new energy market conditions as a

material topic. This is a new addition to the existing list of material topics in 2016. Rapid developments in the

energy market in Greece, coupled with the country's commitments under the MoUs which are bringing about

changes in Greece's energy landscape, have made Management and employees more interested in the role the

Company will play in the emerging energy and economic environment. PPC's goal continues to be to ensure a

competitive environment, where the key concern is benefit for customers.

Material topic: 11. Staffing the Company Staffing the Company was indicated as a material topic primarily by Management, employees and by nongovernmental/ non-profit organisations. An ageing staff coupled with restrictions on new recruitments because of legal provisions applicable to companies in the Greek public sector, are aspects of this topic which directly impact on the Company's operations.

Material topic: 13. Customer service, information and satisfaction Both PPC and stakeholders have identified customer service, information and satisfaction as a material topic. The Company constantly strives to improve the way it provides services to its customers to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. Efforts are being made to strengthen our customer-focused approach, carry out research and examine complaints, taking into account consumer needs. PPC's main objective is to ensure quality customer service and to handle customer requests in the best possible way. It designs specific and uniform procedures to ensure rapid and effective handling of customer requests and complaints. Moreover, providing information to the public and raising awareness about energy savings and protecting the health and safety of consumers and users of electricity is a key concern for PPC.
Material topic: 19. Climate change and greenhouse gas/particle emissions Climate change is a global environmental problem, whose impacts affect all aspects of human life (the environment, health, the food chain, infrastructure, the economy and politics). According to the 5th IPCC assessment report, it is extremely likely that man-made GHG emissions (CO, methane, nitrogen oxide and fluoride gases) are the main cause of climate change. When generating electricity from fossil fuels, GHGs and atmospheric pollutants are released into the air. In this regard, climate change and gas/particle emissions have been recognised as material matters by the Company's Management team, shareholders and investors, partners and suppliers, the State, regulatory authorities and public bodies, regions, local authorities and local communities, as well as by non-governmental and non-profit organisations. Keeping the rise in the average global temperature sufficiently below 2Co and the attempt to bring it even lower, to 1.5Co compared to pre-industrial age levels (targets which were agreed at the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris) require measures to be taken to curtail GHGs in the power generation sector.
Material topic: 24. Energy efficiency/new technologies and 25. Promotion of renewable energy sources Investments in new technologies to improve energy efficiency, and promotion of renewable energy sources are aspects which are deemed material by Company management as well as by all stakeholders. Improving energy efficiency makes a positive contribution to the Company's financial results, while further promoting RES reduces the Company's exposure to fluctuations in carbon prices in the EU's ETS. At the same time PPC recognises its own responsibility for GHG emissions resulting from its operations and helps effectively limit such emissions and thereby combat climate change.

STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
INTRODUCTION
1. Code of Corporate Governance applying to the Company Corporate Governance is a system of principles, based on which the optimal organization, administration and operation of a société anonyme, as well as the transparency in its relations with the shareholders and the safeguarding in general of corporate interests are pursued.
The observance of the principles of corporate governance constitutes an essential commitment and priority of "Public Power Corporation S.A." (herein PPC S.A. or the Company) due to its important role in the Greek economy, and the public interest services it provides.
It is to be noted that the Company is governed by specific laws and regulations applicable to the corporations of the wider public sector, as long as the Hellenic Republic, even indirectly, holds 51% of its share capital. Consequently, its operations shall continue to be subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the companies of the Greek public sector affecting specific procedures, as those concerning, indicatively but not limited to, personnel remuneration policy. The said laws and regulations, to which the current competitors of the Company are not expected to be subject, are likely to limit its operational flexibility and the implementation of the relevant "best practices" of corporate governance.
Specifically, Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations S.A. (HCAP) (in which the Greek State holds 100% of its voting rights) participates directly with 34.123% in PPC's share capital and indirectly with 17% through the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), which is a subsidiary of HCAP. Based on the above, the total percentage of the Hellenic Republic remains indirectly at 51.123%. In accordance with the Act of Legislative Content dated 7.9.2012, which was ratified by article 2 of Law 4092/2012 (OG A' 220/8.11.2012), the obligatory participation of the Hellenic Republic by at least 51% in the share capital was abolished and the Company's Articles of Incorporation were adapted accordingly.
PPC prepares the current statement of Corporate Governance pursuant to the provisions of Article 152 of L. 4548/2018 (OG 104/13.06.2018) as applicable and appropriate, in accordance with the International Accounting Standards which have been established under the Regulation (EC)1606/2002.
PPC has drawn up and implements its own Code of Corporate Governance. Said Code was updated in February 2018 and is posted on the Company's website (www.dei.gr).
It is noted that, according to article 183, para.1 of L. 4548/2018, for the reform of law about Societes Anonymes, PPC is expected in 2019 to harmonize the sum of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation with the provisions of the new law, which is in effect since 01.01.2019. Therefore in the areas of this statement where a reference is made to the provisions of PPC's current Articles of Incorporation that refer to C.L. 2190/1920, it is understood that L. 4548/2018 is applied until the full adjustment of the Articles of Incorporation to the provisions of the L. 4548/2018.
The main axes of the Code of Corporate Governance implemented by PPC are the following: Administration Composition of the Governing Bodies, jurisdiction and functioning. Committees of the Board of Directors (herein BoD) and jurisdiction thereof.
Shareholders Jurisdiction and operation of the General Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders' rights, briefing of the shareholders, as well as reference to the information data required pursuant to article 10 par. 1 of Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament, as incorporated in Law 3461/2006.
Internal audit and risk management Main characteristics of the Company's internal audit and risk management systems, regarding the procedure of preparing its financial statements.

Incorporation, Code of Corporate Governance "Composition of the Board of Directors"). The nominations for

membership on the Board of Directors, along with the curriculum vitae of the nominees, shall be submitted

to the company at least three (3) working days prior to the convocation date of the General Meeting called

for their election, in order to be examined with regard to any impediments or incompatibilities, as well as

to the criteria of their independence (especially in the case of appointment of independent members) by

a Committee of the Board of Directors (art. 9 para.5 of the Articles of Incorporation, Code of Corporate

Governance "Composition of the Board of Directors").

3. In case both positions of Chairman and CEO coincide to the same person, the Board of Directors shall also

of their relationship with the Company as well as upon the terms of such contracts, indicatively the duration

below under)

9. Based on the Company's Rules of Operation as applicable which were approved by the Resolution of the BoD

3/17.1.2019, the Members of the Board of Directors as well as any third person to whom any competencies

of the Board have been assigned by the latter, shall not be allowed to pursue own interests that are contrary

is reported or occurs in accordance with the aforementioned, such Member of the Board shall have no voting

right during the relevant meeting of the Board. Any vote cast by such Member of the Board shall not be

counted toward a quorum and majority.

3. Description of internal audit, regulatory compliance and risk management systems in relation to the procedure of financial statements' preparation

Alternative Performance Measures ("APMs") In discussing the Group's and the Parent Company's performance, "adjusted" measures are used such as: Adjusted EBITDA without one off effects and Adjusted EBITDA margin without one off effects. These adjusted measures are calculated by deducting from performance measures directly derived from amounts of the annual Financial Statement the effect and costs arising from events which have occurred during the reporting period and which have not affected the amounts of previous periods.
EBITDA (Operating Income before depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses and taxes). EBITDA serves to better analyze the operating results of the Group and the Parent Company and is calculated as follows: Total turnover minus total operating expenses before depreciation and impairment. The EBITDA margin (%) is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total turnover. Calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin is presented in Table A.
Operating Expenditure before depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses, profit/(loss) from sale of related companies and taxes excluding one off effects This measure is calculated by subtracting the one-off effects mentioned in the adjusted EBITDA note below from the above Operating Income before depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses, profit/(loss) from sale of relatives and taxes (EBITDA) measure. It is presented on Table B.

Adjusted EBITDA (Operating Income before depreciation and impairment, net financial expenses and taxes). Adjusted EBITDA serves to better analyze the Group's operating income, excluding the impact of one-off effects. For the the year 2018, the one-off effects that affected the adjusted EBITDA are as follows: (1) Provision for severance pay amounting to 148.802. Corresponding to the present value of the future liability incured by PPC S.A. and its subsidiary HEDNO due to the abolition since April 2018 (L. 4533/2018) of the offseting of severance pay 15,000 received by employees when their contracts are terminated with the one-off aid they are entitled to from their insurance organization (negative effect) for the Group from continuing operations. This amount including discontinued operations totals 164,346. For the Parent Company from continuing operations it amounts to 90,670, (2) the final clearance of ETMEAR for 2012, 2013 and 2016, amounting to 105,248 (positive effect) for the Parent Company and the Group, and (3) an amount of 242,691 (negative impact) related to the valuation by an independent valuer of the Group's participation value in the two new Subsidiaries which has affected the Group including the discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results for the year 2017 of the Group and the Parent Company were affected by the one-off positive impact of the recognition of revenue of  359,773 relating to PSOs for the years 2012-2016. The calculation of the adjusted EBITDA and the adjusted EBITDA margin is presented in Table C. Adjusted EBITDA Margin (%) is measured by dividing adjusted EBITDA with Total Revenue. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are presented in Table C.
EBIT (Operating Income before net financial expenses and taxes) EBIT serves to better analyze the operating results of the Group and the Parent Company and is calculated as follows: Total turnover minus total operating expenses. EBIT margin (%) is calculated by dividing EBIT with total turnover. Calculation of EBIT and EBIT margin is presented in Table D
Net amount of Depreciation, Financial Expense and Profit from Subsidiaries and Associates. This Index is calculated as the net amount of depreciation expense, net financial expenses and profits/(losses) from the Group's subsidiaries and associates. The detailed calculation is presented in Table E
Adjusted Profit/Loss before tax without one off effects This measure also serves to better analyze the results and is calculated as follows: Profit/(Loss) before taxes as shown in the Financial Statements excluding one off effects as analyzed in the note above for adjusted EBITDA. The detailed calculation is presented in Table F

Net Debt
Net debt is an APM that Management uses to evaluate the capital structure of the Group and the Parent Company as well as leverage. Net debt is calculated by adding long-term loans, the current portion of long term loans and short term loans and subtracting from the total, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash related to loan agreements and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (for investments held for sale on 2017) and adding the unamortized portion of borrowing costs (see. Note. 29 annual Financial Statements). Calculation of Net Debt is presented in the following table:

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Shareholders of Public Power Corporation S.A.
Report on the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion We have audited the separate and consolidated financial statements ("financial statements") of Public Power Company SA ("the Company"), which comprise the separate and consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018, and the separate and consolidated statements of income statements, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of Public Power Company S.A. and its subsidiaries ("the Group") as at 31 December 2018 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as endorsed by the European Union.
Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), as incorporated in Greek Law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements section of our report. We remained independent of the Company and the Group throughout the period of our appointment in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), as incorporated in Greek Law, together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements in Greece, and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Material uncertainty related going concern We draw your attention to note 3.1 to the financial statements, which highlights that the Company and the Group report decreased revenue and significant pre-tax losses for the year, while as at December 31, 2018 the Company's and the Group's current liabilities exceeded their current assets by 949mil and 708mil, respectively. Based on the Company's assessment the above conditions, which are expected to continue for the next twelve months individually and collectively with other matters as described in the note 3.1, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty, which may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue its operations as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters and the related risks of material misstatement, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Except from the matter, that described in "Material uncertainty related to going concern" we have determined that the matters described below are the key audit matters that should be communicated in our auditor's report.
part ' / Financial Report

For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue (separate and consolidated financial statements)

The Company's and Group's contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to 345mil and 346mil, respectively.
The estimation method used, requires the management to make judgments and use estimates and assumptions with a high degree of uncertainty, of which the most significant are related to the technical and non-technical losses of the distribution network, the invoicing period, the average revenue and the adjustments for discounts and expected credit losses. It is noted that during the financial year 2018, the Company and the Group adopted the International Financial Reporting Standard 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers".
We have determined the estimation of contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue to be a key audit matter due to the inherent risk of revenue recognition in the correct period, the significant audit time required and the high degree of estimation uncertainty of the management's judgments, estimates and assumptions used in this process.
The Company's and Group's disclosures relevant to the accounting policies, the judgments, the estimates and the assumptions used to determine the contract assets from low tension customers unbilled energy can be found in notes 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 5 and 21 to the separate and consolidated financial statements.

The audit procedures that we performed, among others have as follows:
- We assessed the design of management controls over the estimation of the contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue.
- We received and audited the calculation of the contract assets from low tension customers unbilled revenue performed by the management, evaluating the judgments, estimates and assumptions related to the technical and nontechnical losses of the distribution network, the invoicing period, the average revenue and the adjustments for discounts and expected credit losses. We also tested the calculations for mathematical accuracy.
- We assessed the consistency between periods of the estimation methods used, the assumptions, and the calculations used by the Company and the Group, and whether events of the period or changes in the environment or changes in the facts and circumstances have been taken into consideration in the estimates and assumptions used and in changes in the business practices, and the accounting principles which may have affected the calculations.
- Finally, we assessed the sufficiency of related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (separate and consolidated financial statements)

At December 31, 2018 Company's and Group's property, plant and equipment amounted to 10.521mil and 10.758mil, respectively, which are measured at revalued amounts (fair values) as determined by independent periodic valuations (every 3-5 years). The last valuation exercise was performed as of December 31, 2014.
Management assessed that the fair values of the property, plant and equipment have not changed significantly compared to their carrying amount as at December 31, 2018 and accordingly the judgments and estimates used in the previous revaluation (e.g. inflation rate, discount rate, structure and operations of the Company etc.) remain appropriate.
We have determined the valuation of the property, plant and equipment to be a key audit matter due to the level of the related account and the degree of subjectivity in the judgements, estimates and assumptions used by management for the assessment of existence or not of significant changes in the fair values of the property, plant and equipment.
The Company's and Group's disclosures relevant to the accounting policy, the judgments, the estimates and the assumptions used in the valuation of the property, plant and equipment can be found in notes 3.3, 3.4, and 14 to the separate and consolidated financial statements.

The audit procedures that we performed, among others have as follows:
- We discussed with management the assessment of existence of not of significant changes in the fair values of the property, plant and equipment compared to the last valuation exercise performed.
- We assessed the design of management controls over the identification of significant changes in the fair values of property, plant and equipment.
- We received the management's assessment in relation to the absence of significant changes in the fair values of the property, plant and equipment and assessed the judgements, estimates and assumptions used, as well as the accuracy of the data used (e.g. inflation rate, discount rate, structure and operations of the Company etc.).
- Finally, we assessed the sufficiency of related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements.

part ' / Financial Report

Impairment of trade receivables (separate and consolidated financial statements)

As December 31, 2018, the Company's and the Group's trade receivables amounted to 640m and 724m, impaired by 2.572m and 2.690m, respectively.
The Company and Group apply the simplified approach of IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" (which was adopted during the fiscal year) and determine lifetime expected credit losses ("ELC") on their trade receivables. The impairment test of trade receivables is based on the expected credit losses, using historical information on defaults adjusted for the forward looking information.
We have determined the impairment of trade receivables to be a key audit matter due to the level of the related accounts.

The audit procedures that we performed, among others have as follows:
- We assessed the design of management controls over the impairment process of trade receivables.
- We received the calculation of impairment of trade receivables performed by the management and we checked the mathematical accuracy of relevant calculations
- Finally, we assessed the sufficiency of related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements.

The Company's and Group's disclosures relevant to the accounting policy, the judgements, the estimates and the assumptions used for the impairment test of trade receivables can be found in notes 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 20 to the separate and consolidated financial statements.

120

Investments held for sale (separate and consolidated financial statements)

In accordance with the provisions of Law 4533/2018, in 2018 the Company opened an international tender the Company announced, within 2018, an international tender for the sale of its subsidiaries LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.S. and LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A., which in 2019 was ended in failure. Subsequently, pursuant to Law 4602/2019 the Company invited potential investors to submit their bids again in relation to the sale of the two subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2018 the investments in the above subsidiaries amounted to 232mil in the separate financial statements and the assets and liabilities held for sale amounted to 402mil and 123mil in the consolidated financial statements, respectively, were classified as held for sale, as all the criteria in accordance with IFRS 5 were met and were accounted for at the lower of carrying amount and fair value (as determined by an independent third party) less cost to sell.

The audit procedures that we performed, among others have as follows:
- We assessed that the criteria in accordance with IFRS 5 for the classification of the assets and liabilities as held for sale were met.
- We assessed the design of management controls over the impairment process of the assets and liabilities held for sale.
- We received the valuation exercise of the two subsidiaries and assessed the methodology used and the reasonability and appropriateness of the assumptions used. We incorporated valuation specialists in the audit team.
- We evaluated the valuation specialists engaged by the management.

Based on the valuation, the Company impaired the assets held for sale by 236mil and 243mil in its separate and consolidated financial statements, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.

- Finally, we assessed the sufficiency of related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements.

We have determined the valuation of the assets held for sale to be a key audit matter due to the level and the nature of the related accounts in conjunction with the uncertainties of the management's judgments, estimates and assumptions used in this process.

The Company's and Group's disclosures relevant to the accounting policy, the judgments, the estimates and the assumptions used in the valuation the assets held for sale can be found in note 4 to the separate and consolidated financial statements.

The Company's separate and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 were audited by another audit firm. For that year, the Certified Auditor expressed an unmodified opinion on April 27, 2018.
Other Information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information, included in the Annual Report, comprises of the Board of Directors Report, for which reference is also made in section Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements, the Statements of the Members of the Board of Directors, but does not include the financial statements and auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company and the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee of the Company is responsible for overseeing the Company's and the Group's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in Greek Law, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in Greek Law, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company and its subsidiaries audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
Public Power Corporation S.A. ("PPC" or the "Parent Company") was established in 1950 in Greece for an unlimited duration as a State owned and managed corporation for electricity generation, transmission and distribution throughout Greece.
In 1999, the Hellenic Republic enacted Law 2773/1999 ("the Liberalization Law"), which provided for, among other provisions, the transformation of PPC into a sazociété anonyme. PPC's transformation to a société anonyme was effected on January 1st 2001, by virtue of Presidential Decree 333/2000 and its duration was set for 100 years.
Effective December 2001, PPC's shares are listed on the Athens Stock Exchange.
It is noted that from November 29th 2017 at the request of the Parent Company, the deletion of the Company's Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and the cessation of their trading on the London Stock Exchange took place.
On June 15th 2017 the Parent Company lost control of the subsidiary IPTO SA while on June 20th 2017 the full ownership unbundling of IPTO SA was completed as provided for in articles 142 et seq. Of Law 4389/2016.
Pursuant to Law 4533/2018, on June 30th 2018 the Parent Company completed the spin-off of the two branches of lignite power generation Melitis and Megalopolis and their contribution to two new 100% subsidiary companies under the trade names "LIGITIKI MELITIS SA" and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS SA", respectively.
The accompanying financial statements include the separate financial statements of PPC and the consolidated financial statements of PPC and its subsidiaries ("the Group").
PPC headquarters are located at 30, Chalkokondili Street, Athens, 104 32 Greece.
At December 31st 2018, the number of staff employed by the Group was 16,747 (2017: 17,519). At December 31st 2018, 89 employees of the Group (2017: 89), have been transferred to several State agencies (ministries, organizations, etc.), out of which, 85 were compensated by PPC (2017: 88). The total payroll cost of such employees, for the twelve month period ended on December 31st 2018 amounted to Euro 3,434 (2017: Euro 3,527). Additionally, PPC's transferred employees in EFKA (Greek Single Social Security Institution) amounted to 223 on December 31st 2018, for which payroll amounted to Euro 9,684.
PPC Group generates electricity in its own 60 main power generating stations of the Parent Company, from 3 belonging to its wholly owned subsidiaries "LIGITIKI MELITIS SA" and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS SA", and from the additional stations which belong to its wholly owned subsidiary PPC Renewables and distributes electricity to consumers through its own distribution lines for Medium and Low voltage of 239,119 kilometres and 989 kilometres Network of High Voltage lines pertaining to Distribution facilities that are managed by its wholly owned subsidiary "Hellenic Distribution Network Operator (HEDNO S.A.)".

2. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
CHANGES IN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS OF 2018
Auctions of Regulated Term Products (NOME)
· With Decision No. 77 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy (O.G. B58/18.01.2018) the NOME Auction Implementation Scheme was approved, concerning:
1. According the provisions of Law 4512/2018, the following ammendments of L. 4389/2016 took place:
- The introduction of new Eligibility Criteria for the participation of Eligible electricity suppliers in auctions, namely to maintain or develop a retail supply activity, submitting a business plan for their growth and development in the retail market upon registration in the Eligible Suppliers Register and with a new control mechanism during the month of conducting the auction based on load declarations or the business plan submitted for new Eligible Suppliers.
- The modification of the procedure for the adjustment of the annual quantity to be auctioned due to the deviation of PPC's share in the retail market of the interconnected system, with an increase/decrease in the next two auctions following the relevant RAE Decision.
2. Adjustment of the deadline regarding the transition period of the Greek energy market model from the current mandatory pool model to the Target Model, setting August 2018 (instead of December 2017) as the date of implementation.
3. Change in the time limit for resale of sub-products by Alternative Suppliers, from two (2) to three (3) business days prior to the Monthly sub-product Declaration Process, within the secondary market.
4. The additional Semi-annual Impact Report from February 2018 and thereafter every semester, jointly undertaken by the Greek Authorities and the Institutions, which takes into account, among others: "... (a) The introduction of the Target Model in the Electricity Market and the Forward Energy Market, (b) The timely adaptation of the NOME mechanism in order to compensate for the lignite structural measures. This adaptation will include the gradual decrease of the quantities to be auctioned along with the implementation of the lignite structural measures, the decrease ultimately being proportionate to the lignite potential that will be divested upon completion of the divestment from PPC's part, and (c) The possible need to adopt additional structural measures in line with the characteristics of PPC's productive portfolio. "
· In accordance with RAE's Decision 850/2017, and with respect to the Code of Transactions for the Sale of Forward Electricity Products, the following are now applicable:
- For the year 2017, the administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities for Forward Electricity Products is set at 30%.
- For the first half of 2018 and for gradual adjustment purposes, the administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products is set at 50%.
- For the second half of 2018 and up to the submission of the proposed Impact Report by the Market Operator, the administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products is set at 70%.
- Specifically for new Eligible Suppliers which have not yet submitted load declarations within the DAS, the administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products is set at 30% for 2018 and will be revised according to the recommendation of the Market Operator (EMO). The Market Operator's (EMO's) recommendation for setting the administratively set Minimum Use Rate of Distributed Quantities of Forward Electricity Products will be submitted to RAE in December each year.

Additionally, the possibility of submitting purchase orders under the condition of satisfying the quantity requested as a whole by the participants, is restored and it is stipulated that in the case of the zero provisionally allocated quantity of a current valid purchase order, the submitted new purchase order is considered valid in the following cases: i) It increases the price and the numerical value of the quantity requested is greater than zero. ii) It maintains the price level and increases the numerical value of the quantity requested.
· According to Law 4549/2018 (O.G. A 105/14.06.2018) entitled "Provisions for the Completion of the Agreement on Budgetary Targets and Structural Reforms - Medium Term Financial Framework 2019-2022 and other provisions", in article 42 "Adjusted quantities of electricity to be auctioned by means of auctions of forward electricity products with physical delivery", it is provided that: · In accordance with Law 4533/2018 regarding the structural measures for access to lignite and in relation to their timely implementation, the quantities of electricity that may be auctioned, by a RAE decision based on the reduction of PPC's share according to article 135 of Law 4389/2016 (adjustment of the quantities to be auctioned), are reduced by 50%. · With the signing of the share purchase agreements, the mechanism for adjusting the quantities to be auctioned pursuant to article 135 of Law 4389/2016 is abolished. · The annual quantity of electricity to be auctioned for 2019 (as set by Law 4472/2017 by amendment of Law 4389/2016) is reduced from 22% to 13% of the total quantity of electricity of the interconnected system for the previous year, after the pre-requisite operations for each party (new investors) have been implemented. Within January 2019, the Hellenic Energy Exchange (HEnEx SA) will submit to RAE a proposal for the amendment of the Code of Transactions for Future Products (CBC) for the compatibility of the mechanism with the launch of the New Electricity Market (according to Law 4425/2016 for the reorganization of the Greek Electricity Market in implementation of the legislation for the completion of the single European electricity market), in particular regarding the declarations of the use of forward products quantities, the system declaration of programs of HEnEx S.A. and the obligations of physical delivery and the balancing of the parties.
- With Decision No. 85 of the Government's Council for Economic Policy (O.G. B2266/15.06.2018) the NOME Auction Implementation Scheme was approved in order for the Greek Authorities to initiate the implementation of the roadmap following the EU target model for the electricity market, which must be completed by April 2019. The amendment of the NOME Auction Implementation Scheme concerns paragraphs 1.3, 2.2 and 3.1.9 in order to comply with the provisions of article 42 of Law 4549/2018 relating to the updating of futures electricity products under auction and following the Law. 4533/2018 on structural measures for access to lignite.
- The RAE Decision 1248/2018 (20.12.2018) establishes the annual quantity of electricity available through auctions for the sale of futures products with physical delivery, the distribution of quantity in individual futures products and the Schedule of auctions for the year 2019. More specifically, the annual quantity for 2019 amounts to 1,273 MWh/h and is allocated to annual futures products, which will be auctioned quarterly according to the auction schedule. The RAE, with its next Decision 164/2019 (January 28th 2019), adjusted the annual amount of electricity available through the auctions for the sale of futures products with natural delivery for the year 2019, due to the deviation from the annual target The share of PPC, under par. 2 and 4 of article 135 of L. 4389/2016 as applicable (Deviation Quantity 524 MWh/h) and amending the RAE Decision 1248/2018
Structural measures on access to lignite and the further opening of the wholesale electricity market
Decision 57/2017 (O.G. 72/A/19.5.2017) of the Government's Council for Economic Policy, concerning the structural measures for PPC's access to lignite was published, which Greece will propose to the Commission's Directorate General for Competition (DG Comp.) until November 2017 and will be implemented by June 2018 in compliance with Decisions C (2008) 824 and C (2009) 6244 of the European Commission on PPC's access to

lignite, which became irreversible after the (2016) 733 and (2016) 748 decisions of the General Court of the European Union. The binding remedial structural remedies will be designed in accordance with the following principles : I. The measures would include PPC's disinvestment of lignite power generating units to existing or new
alternative suppliers and other investors. II. PPC would have no involvement or connection with any element of disinvestment, including preferential
electricity supply. In line with the Commission's communication on structural measures acceptable under Regulation 139/2004 and Regulation 802/2004, the purchaser (s) a) would be independent of and will not have any association with PPC and its affiliated companies; b) should possess the financial resources, proven know-how and incentive to maintain and develop the disinvested portfolio of power generating units as a viable and active competitive power in relation to PPC and other competitors, and c) on the basis of the information available, they would not cause or threaten to cause prima facie competition concerns and they would not create a risk of delay in the implementation of the structural measures. III. Disinvestment will account for about 40% of PPC's lignite power generating capacity. The exact percentage would be determined during technical discussions with the European Commission in accordance with the abovementioned decisions. The disinvestment would include the associated lignite reserves, in accordance with paragraph 248.1 of the Commission's Decision C (2008) 824, which states that "the Hellenic Republic could reallocate some of the rights currently enjoyed by PPC in this case and given that the lignite reserves are connected to the nearby electricity generating units, access to the lignite reserves should be combined with the transfer of the ownership or the franchise of the respective unit
This obligation of the Hellenic Republic was also included in the Supplementary Memorandum of Understanding agreed and signed in July 2017 by the Hellenic Republic and the European Commission on behalf of the European Stability Mechanism.
In this context, in January 2018, the Hellenic Republic proposed to the European Commission's DirectorateGeneral for Competition as a binding structural measure the disinvestment of three (3) existing PPC's lignite units, namely Meliti 1 (330 MW installed capacity), Megalopolis 3 (300 MW) and Megalopolis 4 (300 MW), as well as the production license for a new lignite unit (Meliti 2, 450 MW), together with the exploration and exploitation rights of the lignite mines (Megalopolis mine for the units Megalopolis 3 and 4 and Kleidi mine, Meliti hills and Vevi for Meliti). The Directorate-General for Competition conducted a market test for the abovementioned commitment by the Hellenic Republic and made it definitively acceptable and legally binding. · In order to fulfill the Hellenic Republic's commitment to the European Commission's Directorate-General for
Competition to take structural measures regarding PPC's access to lignite, the Greek Parliament passed Law 4533/2018 (G.O. A 75/27.4.2018) entitled «Structural measures for access to lignite and the further opening of the wholesale electricity market and other provisions ". According to the provisions of the above mentioned Law, PPC undertakes the obligation to proceed to the disinvestment of three (3) existing PPC lignite units, namely Megalopolis 3 (300 MW of installed capacity), Megalopolis 4 (300 MW of installed capacity), Meliti 1 (330 MW installed capacity), the production license for a new lignite unit (Meliti 2, 450 MW of installed capacity), together with the exploration and exploitation rights of the related lignite mines (Megalopolis mine for the units Megalopolis 3 and 4 and Kleidi mine, Meliti hills and Vevi for Meliti), as well as the related mining equipment. The disinvestment will take place through the spin-off and contribution of two (2) lignite branches of PPC S.A. in two (2) new companies (one in Meliti and one in Megalopolis). Furthermore the Law provides for disinvestment procedure, the framework of the international tender procedure for the sale of the shares that PPC SA will acquire from the two (2) new companies, the labor relations of employees in two (2) spin-off branches, PPC's responsibilities and the responsibility of the two (2) new companies.

According to the above, the Law refers to the creation of two (2) new sociétés anonymes from the perspective of assets, liabilities and human resources, with the sole shareholder being PPC.
In particular, it is provided that, in the first company to be set up, PPC contributes as a branch the assets, rights and obligations related to its lignite power generation activity in the area of Meliti Florina and in the wider region where public lignite deposits are located and in the second company to be also set up, PPC contributes as a branch the assets, rights and obligations related to its lignite power generation activity in the area of Megalopolis Arcadia. · PPC will transfer all the obtained shares that the new companies will issue, to legal entities interested in acquiring them, which will become preferred investors in an open, international bidding tender. The tender will be carried out with PPC's care and expenses, in accordance with the Greek State's commitments to the European Commission referring to structural measures in the lignite-fired power generation sector. The tender will be launched through an open, international, public invitation by PPC until May 31st 2018 and will be completed by signing the share purchase agreement and other contracts within six (6) months from the date of entry into force of the European Commission's decision. The tender procedure will take place in two stages: At first, PPC will issue an Invitation to submit an Expression of Interest ("EoI) until May 31st 2018, which will lead to the pre-selection of investors who meet the technical, financial and legal criteria set. At a second stage, pre-selected investors will be invited to sign a Confidentiality Agreement relating to the tender process and become "Eligible Participants" and will then receive the Invitation to submit a Binding Offer, in order to participate in the 2nd Phase of the Process, where they will gain access to the Virtual Data Room (VDR), that will be set up and will conduct a due diligence in order to submit binding offers. In this tender procedure, interested parties may submit bids either for the acquisition of all the shares of the two new companies or for the acquisition of all the shares of one of them. In order to ensure the fair valuation of the market value of the sectors contributed, PPC will, subject to the prior approval of the European Commission, appoint a sufficiently qualified and appropriately accredited international independent valuator to determine the fair value range of the commercial value of each sector. This assessment will remain confidential until the financial offers of the participants in the tender are opened and then it will be handed over to PPC's Board of Directors and to the European Commission's Monitoring Agent. In the event that financial bids fall short of this assessment, PPC may request the submission of improved final financial bids to safeguard both its legitimate financial interests as well as those of its shareholders. In the context of the tender timetable and within a reasonable time from the submission of the final financial bids, which will be specified in the relevant tender notice by PPC and in any case before taking a final decision on the selection of the preferred bidder(s), PPC's BoD may obtain a "fairness opinion" from another international independent valuator, such as an international investment bank, on the submitted bid. Furthermore, PPC is required to hire a Monitoring Trustee to act on behalf of the European Commission, in order to ensure the economic viability and competitiveness of the branches, until the completion of their disinvestment from PPC's part and to monitor the procedures of the tender according to the provisions of EU laws regarding compliance with competition law. For the safe and orderly technical, commercial and administrative operation of both new companies and PPC as well, both before and after the completion of the proposed disinvestment, the possibility of entering into any service level agreement and/or leasing contract of real estate which is necessary is provided, on the basis of cost effectiveness and with transparent and ordinary for such contracts other commercial, technical, financial and legal terms and conditions. PPC has undertaken all the actions required by the Law to fulfill the Hellenic Republic's commitment to the European Commission.

In particular, following the relevant decisions of the Board of Directors and the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of PPC of June 26th 2018, the two Notarial Acts for the formation of Sociétés Anonymes were signed with the contribution of the decommissioned PPC Branches and on June 30th 2018 the registrations were announced in the General Commercial Registry (GEMI) of the two new 100% subsidiary companies of PPC SA "LIGNITIKI MELITIS SA" and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS SA". The international tender required by the Law was launched on May 31st 2018 with the publication by PPC of a Call for Expressions of Interest, in which a total of six (6) interested parties responded, all of which were evaluated as fulfilling the pre-selected criteria, qualified as Eligible Participants and were invited to submit their binding offers for the acquisition of 100% of PPC's shareholding in the share capital of the subsidiaries "Lignitiki Melitis SA" and/or "Lignitiki Megalopolis SA". Following the formation of a consortium between 2 of the Participants during the tender procedure, 3 interested parties eventually became active. The final date for submission of tenders, after extensions given with the consent of the European Commission, was finally set on February 6th 2019, on which date two of the three interested parties submitted a binding offer. Of these offers, one was considered ineligible as it did not meet the criteria of the Invitation to Tender, while the second was judged to be economically unprofitable by PPC's Board of Directors. Following the above, the relevant tender process was declared barren. On March 7th 2019 the Hellenic Parliament voted and on March 9th 2019 published (OG A 45) the Law 4602/2019, which amended and supplemented the Law 4533/2018. With the new provisions, PPC is invited to call for a repeat competitive bidding process, inviting the candidates who participated in the previous tender procedure and other investors who wish to show interest in the acquisition of the shares of "Lignitiki Megalopolis SA" and/or "Lignitiki Melitis SA". within 7 days of the invitation. Pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of the Law, following a relevant decision of the Board of Directors, PPC on March 8th 2019 proceeded to post on its website the Joint Invitation for Expressions of Interest & Invitation to Submit Binding Tenders, inviting investors to initially express interest to take part in the tender procedure until March 15th 2019. They will then sign a Confidentiality Convention, gain access to the Virtual Data Room (VDR), and conduct due diligence in order to reach bids, while in the meantime they must provide the necessary supporting documents to prove the fulfillment of the technical, financial and legal criteria set out, which are the same as those set out in the previous procedure. Moreover, Law 4602/2019 provides that the contract for the purchase of the shares of each new company is legally valid, while regarding the estimation of the value of the new companies there is a change in the provision of Law 4533/2018, and PPC may designate a valuator to determine a fair value range of the market value of each of the sectors contributed. In this case, the appraiser shall take into account relevant transactions on the European market and the results of the previous tender. On the contrary, PPC SA is required to designate an appraiser in order to obtain an opinion on the fairness of the offer, but that appraiser shall not take into account any assessment made under the preceding paragraph. In the aforementioned Joint Call for Expressions of Interest and Invitation to Submit Binding Bids, on March 15th 2019 six (6) interested parties responded, five (5) of whom had expressed their interest in the previous tender procedure, and one (1) new. All the above interested parties were considered as eligible in principle, subject to their submission of the necessary supporting documents to demonstrate that the pre-selection criteria were met within the deadline. The due diligence process is already in progress by all participants.

Special fee for lignite exploration and exploitation rights According to the aforementioned Law 4533/2018, on December 31st 2018 the "Fee for the development of industrial areas where electricity is produced from lignite fired plants" referred to Article 20 of Law 2446/1996 ( '276), as amended and in force, is repealed and it is replaced from January 1st 2019 by the "Special Fee for lignite exploration and exploitation rights" in favor of the Western Macedonia and Peloponnese regions and at the expense of electricity producers by means of lignite fired plants, which own or have been granted in any way lignite exploration and exploitations rights on lignite areas within the Greek Territory. The above mentioned special fee of 1.40 per megawatt (/MWh) of electricity produced from lignite will not be included in the variable cost of lignite power plants and will be recovered by the lignite units through a relevant charge added to the surcharge charges of the wholesale electricity market. The funds resulting from the imposition of the above special fee will be used to fund infrastructure, development and environmental protection projects, as well as relocation projects for the settlements of the Arcadia, Kozani and Florina Regional Units. By a decision of the Minister of Environment and Energy, the manner, the instruments, the criteria and the procedure for the collection, distribution and payment of the fee in the above Regions, the procedure for its adjustment, as well as any other relevant issue will be determined. The same decision will determine the fines imposed in the event of non-payment of the fee or non-compliance with the other obligations provided for therein.

NATURAL GAS The Decision of the Ministry of Environment and Energy No. 174842, was published (OG B' 1969 / 01.06.2018), regarding the issuance of the Natural Gas Supply Code to Customers, which defines and regulates the rights and obligations of Suppliers and Customers, both at the stage of negotiations and the conclusion of the contract between them, as well as during the fulfillment of their contractual obligations. In summary: As a Customer is defined the natural gas final customer, i.e. the natural or legal person which purchases Natural Gas exclusively for its own use. Based on the purpose of the end-use of Natural Gas that is procured, Final Customers are classified as Residential Customers and Non-Residential which are further classified as Commercial, Industrial and Electricity Producers. Subcategories of the main categories include, in particular, Customers which purchase Natural Gas for Cogeneration and Air Conditioning as well as Customers outside the Transmission System and Distribution Network. The following Natural Gas sales do not fall into the provisions of the above mentioned Code: (a) sales of Natural Gas delivered to the Virtual Statement of Evidence or the Virtual Transaction Point where
there is no Natural Gas Meter; (b) Natural Gas Sales to Natural Gas Supply License Holders, (c) sales of Natural Gas to NNGS and Distribution Networks Managers. The Natural Gas Licensing Regulation was approved by the Decision of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy no. OIK178065 (OG B 3430 / 17.08.2018) governing the granting, modification, transfer and revocation of the Independent System of Natural Gas License, the Natural Gas System Management License, the Natural Gas Distribution License, the Natural Gas Network Management License and the Natural Gas Supply to Customers License. Law 4549/2018 (OG A' 105/14.06.2018) entitled "Provisions for the Completion of the Agreement on Budgetary Targets and Structural Reforms - Medium-Term Framework of the Financial Strategy 2019-2022 and other provisions", Article 125 "Electronic Auction Programs of natural gas quantities", provides that Suppliers with a high market share (covering 40% or more of the total annual quantity of Natural Gas supplied to Greece the Eligible Customers) are obliged to implement an electricity auctioning of gas quantities per year until December 31st 2020. The quantities to be auctioned are determined a RAE's Decision, following cooperation with the Competition Commission, in proportion to the market share of each Supplier with a high market share and at a maximum of 20% of the amount allocated by the Supplier in the previous calendar year to Eligible Customers. RAE, with its Decision 500/2018, approved the Preventive Action Plan in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 on measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) 994/2010, which aims at presenting appropriate measures (actions) to reduce or eliminate the risks that may affect the security of supply of the Country with natural gas. With the Decision RAE 1287/2018, entitled "Regulation of management issues of the National Natural Gas System for the implementation of Action 5 of the Preventive Action Plan for the safeguarding of the security of supply with Natural Gas", (OG B 5 900/31.12.2018 The adoption of specific regulatory measures to complement the relevant provisions of the ESFA Management Code, exclusively for the period during which the Power generators keep LNG safety stock at the LNG Facility of Revithousa Island during Defined in Action "5" of the Preventive Action Plan (in the context of implementation of the Actions of the Preventive Action Plan, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 on measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and which was approved by The Decision RAE 500/2018).

3. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Approval of financial statements The Board of Directors of the Parent Company approved the accompanying financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 on April 23, 2019. These financial statements are subject to approval by the Parent Company's General Shareholders Meeting.
Basis of preparation of financial statements The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention (except for fixed assets and financial assets that have been measured at fair value through other comprehensive income), assuming that PPC will continue as a going concern. The financial statements are presented in thousands of Euro and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated. During the year ended December 31st 2018, the Group and Parent Company recorded losses that are mainly attributable to the following factors: 1) a provision of  164 million relating to the initial recognition of the actuarial liability for severance payment
to employees leaving service to retire (Law 4533/2018), 2) a negative impact of  196 million from the additional charge for suppliers for the special RES account, which
is by law abolished since 1.1.2019, 3) the increased cost by  146 million from the increase in CO prices (resulting to higher System Marginal
Price), most of which was not passed on to consumers as there is no clause regarding CO or System Marginal Price in PPC's Low Voltage invoices 4) the negative impact of NOME type auctions of forward electricity products at prices below the System Marginal Price, which amounted to  223.8 million, 5) a provision of  78.7 million for interest on overdue amounts claimed by IPTO through an extrajudicial letter due to PPC's participation in the wholesale electricity market.
At the same time, the Group's and the Parent Company's total short-term liabilities exceed the total short-term assets by approximately Euro 708 million and Euro 949 million, respectively. This difference is mainly due to the decreased operating profitability, the obligation to repay long-term debt of  725.8 million within year 2019, and also, an important part is due to to the additional obligation for purchases of CO rights due to the rapid increase in international prices within 2018 . It is noted that the Group and the Parent Company as at December 31st 2018 are in full compliance with the terms of all their loan contracts.
Based on the projected cash flows of the Group and the Parent Company for a period of 12 months from the date of preparation of financial statements and in order for the Parent Company to be able to meet its obligations it has proceeded to the following actions: 1) Securing long term borrowings and a release (guarantees because of borrowing) of blocked deposits totaling
 690.4 million in 2019, while the long-term loan repayment liability will be limited to  681.6 million due to a loan refinancing with a Greek bank. PPC's loan drawdowns include an amount of  155 million in January 2019 from a total approved credit line of  255 million from EIB, an amount of  162 million from a credit line from KFW IPEX BANK for the construction of the Ptolemaida V plant and an amount of 200 million

from a credit line by a consortium of Greek Banks for the repayment of the international bond with maturity in 2019. Moreover, PPC's Board of Directors and Black Sea Trade & Development Bank's Board of Directors have approved the financial terms of a new  160 million loan with a duration of five years, with an one-off repayment at the loan maturity and a competitive rate. The loan will be used to finance PPC's investment plan. 2) Collection from the Greek State in March 2019 of an amount of  550.7 million, as a prepayment for electricity consumption of its entities for the year 2019. This prepayment by the Greek State is expected to be repeated in the first quarter of 2020 on the basis of a five-year agreement signed with the Greek State on 14.6.2018. 3) In March 2019, the Parent Company reduced the discount rate for the timely payment of electricity bills from 15% to 10% for electricity bills issued from April 1 2019, which will result in an annual expected earnings growth of  60 million.
4) The annual cumulative surplus of the Interconnected System and Network Special RES Account (ELAPE) is expected to be refunded to electricity suppliers. Based on the published ELAPE's Bulletin following the December 2018 clearing, this surplus amounts to  191 million, of which  121 million will be returned to suppliers in 2019, thus providing a security reserve of  70 million, in accordance with Law 4585/2018. Given that PPC's retail electricity market share for 2018 was around 82%, it is estimated that the relevant amount will stand to approximately  100 million. The prerequisite for the return of this amount is the approval by RAE of the relevant methodology proposed by the Operator (ex EMO, DAPEEP), hence the exact date of the return is still not known.
It is also noted that in the signed contract for the refinancing of the two bond loans, which the Parent Company concluded in 2018 with a consortium of Greek banks, it is stipulated that 70% of the proceeds from the sale of the two lignite subsidiaries established under the provisions of Law 4533 / 2018 will be directed to the repayment of the aforementioned loan obligations, while in case of a successful outcome of the tender for the sale of the aforementioned subsidiaries during the first half of 2019 the quantities of forward NOME products which will be auctioned in the second half of 2019 will be reduced. This will contribute to an improved profitability and cash flows. These assumptions are not currently integrated into the projected cash flows of the Parent Company.
Taking into consideration the resulting cash flows from the approved Budget and all available information for the foreseeable future, Management considers that the Group and the Parent Company have ensured that they will continue to operate as a going concern. In particular, their consolidated and separate financial statements were prepared on the basis of the going concern principle as the Management does not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their transactions and under no circumstances is forced to do so.
Consequently, the Management concluded that the basis of the going concern is the correct one for preparing the Group's and the Parent Company's financial statements, after having taken into consideration a broad range of factors. However, it should be noted that assuming that short-term liabilities continue to exceed short-term receivables in the future, that cash flows resulting from operations will be reduced and due to the lack of a cost recovery mechanism, the Group and the Parent Company are exposed to the risk of potential significant increases of international CO emission prices and / or System Marginal Price and to mitigate this risk additional actions will be required. The above mentioned assumptions indicate the existence of a substantial uncertainty and to counter this uncertainty additional actions will be required in the very near future

166

Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries, drawn up to December 31st each year. Subsidiaries (companies in which the Group directly or indirectly or through other subsidiaries has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operations) have been consolidated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which effective control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Losses within a subsidiary are apportioned to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary (without any change in control) is accounted for as an equity transaction. All inter-company balances and transactions have been fully eliminated as well as unrealized intra­group gains and losses. Where necessary, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been revised to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. It is noted that certain of the abovementioned requirements have not a retrospective effect, and due to this reason the following differences are carried forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation:
· Losses incurred by the Group were not attributed to the non-controlling interest until the balance was reduced to nil. Any further excess losses were attributed to the Parent Company, unless the non-controlling interest had a biding obligation to cover these.
In case that the Group loses control of a subsidiary then the following are: Derecognized : - The assets (including the surplus value) and liabilities of the subsidiary - The book value of the non-controlling interest - The accumulated exchange differences, which have been recorded in Equity
Recognized: - The fair value of the price obtained - The fair value of the remaining participation - Any surplus or deficit in the Statement of Income - The Parent Company's share in the elements previously recognized in the comprehensive income statement,
in the income statement or the retained earnings where that is judged necessary.
3.2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations adopted
The accounting policies on the basis of which the annual separate and consolidated financial statements were prepared for the year ended December 31st 2018 were consistent with those used in the preparation of the annual saperate and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st of December 2017 with the exception of the following amendments and standards, which were adopted by the Group and the Parent Company on the January 1st 2018. The Group and the Parent Company adopted for the first time IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The nature and effect of these changes are analyzed below in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8. Various other amendments and interpretations were adopted for the first time in 2018 but did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2018.

· IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The Group and the Parent Company have elected to adopt the new standard on January the 1st 2018 without restating the relevant comparative figures. The impact of the adjustments resulting from the adoption of the new standard was recognized directly in retained earnings as at January the 1st 2018.
The table below shows the adjustments made for each separate line item in the Statement of Financial Position. Any line amounts not affected by the changes introduced by the new standard are not included in the table. These adjustments are described below in more detail.

(a) Classification and measurement
In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss, or fair value through other comprehensive income on the basis of the enterprise's business model for the management of financial assets and their contractual cash flows.
With the exception of trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction value, the Group and the Parent Company initially measure a financial asset at its fair value plus transaction costs in case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss .
To sum up, at the initial application of IFRS 9, the Group and the Parent Company proceeded to the following adjustments:

(b) Impairment
The adoption of IFRS 9 led to a change in the Group's and Parent's Accounting Policy relating to impairment losses on financial assets as the treatment of IAS 39 for the recognition of incurred losses was replaced with the recognition of expected credit losses.
With respect to 'Trade receivables', the Group and the Parent Company applied the simplified approach to the standard and calculated the expected credit losses over the life of the receivables. For this purpose, a table was used to measure expected credit loss provisions in a way reflecting past experience, as well as forecasts of the future financial situation of customers and the economic environment.

For other financial assets the expected credit losses are calculated over a 12-month period. The expected credit losses for the 12-month period are the proportion of expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset arising from credit events that are likely to occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date. In any case, if there is a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition of the asset, the provision will be based on the expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset.
The Group considers that non-recovery of receivables constitutes a credit event as follows:
· For Low voltage customers for more than 180 days · For Medium and high voltage customers for more than 90 days · For Public and broader public sector entities for more than 365 days
However, in specific cases, the Group and the Parent Company may assess for certain financial assets that there is a credit event when there is internal or external information indicating that the collection of the amounts determined under the relevant contract is unlikely to be fully collected.
The table below shows the reconciliation of the impairment provision according to IAS 39 with the corresponding provision as calculated according to IFRS 9:

· IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model applicable to revenues arising from contracts with customer agreement (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction or the industry. The requirements of the Standard also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on the sale of certain non-financial assets that are not produced by the entity's ordinary activities (eg, sales of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets). Extensive disclosures are required, including the analysis of total revenue, information on performance obligations, changes in contract asset balances and contractual obligations between periods and key judgments and estimates.
The Group and the Parent Company proceeded on 01/01/2018 in the adoption of IFRS 15, following the modified retrospective approach, recognizing the cumulative effect of the adoption of the new standard on the opening balance of "Retained Earnings", without readjusting the comparative figures for the previous reporting period.
In accordance with IFRS 15, an entity's income is recognized when its customer acquires control of the goods or services by specifying the time that the control is transferred either at a specific moment or over time. The underlying principle is that an entity recognizes revenue in a manner that reflects the transfer of the goods or services to customers at the amount it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services through the application of five steps.
· Identify the contract(s) with a customer · Identify the performance obligations in the contract on behalf of the entity, · Determine the transaction price · Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on behalf of the entity · Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Group's and Parent Company's main revenue categories for which the impact of IFRS 15 has been assessed concern:
Revenue from the sale of electricity to customers The Group and the Parent Company are active in the supply of electricity to high, medium and low voltage customers through the Operations electricity Supply Sector. Given the particular characteristics of electric ity, the Group and the Parent Company consider that their customers to which they sell simultaneously receive and consume on the benefits resulting from the sale of electricity as the Parent Company fulfills its contractual obligations and therefore revenue from sales of electricity will continue to be recognized in the same way as in previous years in accordance with IAS 18, using the same accounting policy. For this reason, revenue recognition (as long as the collection of the total amounts is considered probable) is made at the point of issuing the electricity bill/invoice.
Revenue from electricity distribution services The Group offers electricity distribution services to all Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) consumers in Greece, collecting a fee for the provision of this service. The parent company PPC SA (the owner of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network - HEDN) and its 100% subsidiary HEDNO SA, (administrator of the HEDN) receive an annual fee (collectively referred to as "HEDN's Required Revenue"), which is identified and approved by RAE `s decision and is distributed among the the owner and the administrator of the HEDN. The Required Revenue for HEDN is determined on the basis of data submitted to RAE by HEDNO S.A. and aims at the following: a) Coverage of the return on capital invested in Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network. b) Coverage of the cost of depreciation of Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network's fixed assets. c) Coverage of HEDNO's operational costs (as administrator of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network).

The Annual Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network's Required Revenue is recovered through charges paid by Network Users (Medium and Low Voltage Power Customers) for using Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network. Those charges are also approved by RAE's decision. Part of the above revenue recovered by HEDNO S.A. is paid to PPC SA (the owner of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network) based on RAE `s decision with which the amount and percentage of distribution among the Owner and the Administrator of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network was approved. Concerning IFRS 15, the Group has concluded that revenue from electricity distribution services will continue to be recognized in the same way as in previous years in accordance with IAS 18, using the same accounting policy, as its customers receive and spend at the same time the services provided by the Group.
Contract Assets At each reporting date and taking into account that the invoicing based on the measurement data of the last month of the period is issued during the first days of the following month, as far as High and Medium Voltage customers are conserned, the total value of electricity provided that month is recognized as accrued revenue for the period, and is reversed in the following month, after billing has already been recorded in books. These accruals at the end of each reporting period are classified as "Short-term contract assets". Additionally, at each reporting date, the Parent Company estimates the value of the consumed and non-invoiced electricity from Low Voltage customers, since it has developed an estimation method especially for doing so. The estimated values are recorded as income receivable for periods ending on the reporting date and are reversed during the following month. Those accruals are also classified as "Contract assets" at the end of each reporting period.
Contract Liabilities If the customer pays a fee, or the Group reserves an unconditional right to a sum of money, before the Group tranferring the goods or services to the customer, it is recording the contract as a contractual obligation to the customer, either when the payment is made or when it becomes chargeable (whichever comes first).
For the Group, contract liabilities come mainly from:
· Customers contributions · Payments in advance against electricity consumption paid by customers at the time of signing the electricity
supply contract. · An advance payment of 3% or 5% on the value of the electricity provided through NOME auctions, which are
paid by the electricity supplier participants in the NOME auctions to the Parent Company. · Prepayments paid by customers against future consumption of electricity.
The first two of the above categories have been recorded and included in Statement of Financial Position until 31.12.2017 as "Other non ­ current liabilities", whereas the other two as "Accrued and other current liabilities".
The Group reached the following by examining the provisions of IFRS 15:
Customer contibutions Consumers or producers connected to the distribution network are required to participate in the initial cost of connecting to the network (meters, lines, substations, etc.) or other types of infrastructure by paying institutionally fixed amounts of money or by contributing fixed assets (extremely rare cases). It is noted that all the facilities that are constructed are under the exclusive ownership and possession of the parent company by contract, and in case a customer leaves a facility and a new customer enters, that new customer is not obliged to pay for a new participation.
Until December 31, 2008, due to the lack of defined accounting treatment by IFRS, the Parent Company recorded the amounts of participations received from customers for the construction of the fixed assets required for their

part ' / Financial Report

172

connection to the network upon collection and depicted them in Statement of Financial Position as Deferred Income. Their depreciation was calculated on the basis of the remaining useful life of the corresponding assets funded and included in depreciation in the Statement of Income (the accounting principle applied to grants). As of January 1st, 2009, the Parent Company, by earlier implementation of IFRIC 18 "Transfers of Assets from Customers" recognized all of the amounts and assets received from customers as part of their network connection at fair value in the Statement of Income. For the amounts received until December 31st 2008, it followed the accounting policy that was in force until December 31st , 2008.
The Parent Company on 01/01/2018 reviewed the accounting treatment of the above received amounts of customers' contributions under IFRS 15 and concluded that, customers' contributions refer to the initial and continuous connection in the distribution network, which is a distinct service, separate from electricity sale. The service which is promised to be delivered is the only one to be executed by HEDNO and this transaction is considered a separate contractual obligation. Therefore, revenue from customers' contributions is recognized as the service is transferred to the customer, that is over time. Customers' contributions are classified as "Long ­ term contract liabilities", while revenue from customers' contributions is recognized on the basis of the remaining useful life of distribution network's fixed assets will be included in "Revenue".
To sum up, during the initial application of IFRS 15, the Group and Parent Company made the following adjustments:

Advanced Payments against electricity consumption paid by customers at the time of signing the electricity supply contract
By signing the electricity supply contract, the customer is required to pay an advance - a guarantee against future electricity consumption. This amount is not refunded to the customer but is offset by the amount of the last clearing account following the request for suspention of electricity supply to the customer. Concidering that these amounts are settled in a period over 12 months, the Group classified them since 01.01.2018 as "contract liabilities". Group and Parent Company concluded that these prepayments are not an important part of funding as they are given for collateral purposes.

Advance payments of 3% or 5% on the value of the electricity provided through NOME auctions, which are paid by the participants in the NOME auctions to the Parent Company
During the NOME-type auctions for futures products, which are executed every three months and involve the Parent Company's sale of electricity futures on the wholesale market for a period of 12 months, the electricity suppliers pay in advance 3% or 5% of the value of electricity awarded to them. Under IFRS 15, as of 01/01/2018, these amounts are initially recognized as "short-term contract liabilities" as they are settled within 12 months, while the recognition of revenue is made monthly by the 1/12 amortization, wheras the Parent Company sells the electricity to other electricity suppliers. In case an electricity supplier does not exercise all his rights to purchase electricity on the wholesale market, the unamortized amount of the advance payment is recognized in the Statement of Income (IFRS 15 B45). As far as the amortized amount of advance payments received until 31/12/2017 is conserned, it was reclassified as "short-term contract liabilities".
Prepayments paid by customers against future consumption of electricity
By decisions of the Parent Company's Board of Directors, it is possible for Medium & Low Voltage customers (for High Voltage customers this possibility is included in the contract) to pre-pay the annual electricity consumption against a discount on the price of electricity. Since 01/01/2018, those received amounts are recognized initially as "short-term contract liabilities" as they are settled within 12 months, whereas the revenue is proportionally recognized at the date of invoicing the customers (IFRS 15 §106). The non-settled amounts that were collected until 31/12/2017 and have not been settled were reclassified to "short-term contract liabilities ".
· IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications)
The objective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB's intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, particularly: a) the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the "separately identifiable" principle, b) of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is a principal or an agent as well as applications of control principle and c) of licensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that select to apply the modified retrospective approach.

· IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share based Payment Transactions (Amendments)
The Amendments provide requirements on the accounting for a) the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments, b) for share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations and c) for modifications to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. There is no impact to the financial statements of the Group or/and the Parent Company's from these amendments.
· IAS 40: Transfers to Investment Property (Amendments)
The Amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development into or out of investment property. The Amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of that change in use. A change in management's intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use. There is no impact for the financial statements of the Group or/and the Parent Company's from these amendments.
· IFRIC INTERPETATION 22: Foreign currency transactions and prepayments
The interpretation clarifies the accounting treatment of transactions involving the collection or payment of an advance payment in foreign currency. The interpretation deals with foreign currency transactions in which an entity recognizes a non-monetary asset or a non-monetary liability arising on the collection or payment of an advance payment before the initial recognition of the relevant asset, expense or income. The Interpretation indicates that the transaction date for determining the exchange rate is the date of initial recognition of a nonmonetary prepayment or a deferred income. If there are multiple payments or prepayments, the entity must set the transaction date for each payment and prepayment. There is no impact on the financial statements of the Parent Company and/or the Group.
The IASB issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 ­ 2016 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRS's. There is no impact on the financial statements of the Parent Company and/or the Group.
· IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures: The amendments clarify that the option to measure at fair value through profit or loss, an investment in an associate or a joint venture held by an entity that is an investment fund management entity or similar entity may be carried out separately for each investment in an associate or joint venture, at initial recognition.
Standards and Interpretations which are mandatory for subsequent periods and have not been applied earlier by the Company (or the Group)
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are mandatory for subsequent periods. The Company and the Group have not yet applied the following standards.
· IFRS 16: Leases
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, which are the customer (`lessee') and the supplier (`lessor'). The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases on their financial statements. Lessees will have a single accounting framework for all leases, with some exceptions.

Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged. The Standard will mainly affect the accounting treatment of the Group's and Parent Company's operating leases.
Group management expects the Standard to have an impact in all assets and liabilities at the point of it's first application due to the capitalization of operating leases as assets and the recognition of the corresponding liabilities.
Main categories of operating leases are: a) Buildings. b) Facilities. c) Chartering of ships for the transport of fuels in non-interconnected islands in order to produce electricity d) Car rentals. e) Fixed-term contracts at Group and the Parent Company `s facilities through supplier's fixed assets.
Before applying IFRS 16, the Group and the Parent Company recognized operating leasing expences as a fixed amount throughout the leasing period.
The Group and the Parent Company will apply IFRS 16 for the first time on January 1st 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. According to this approach, (a) a long-term interest bearing liability will be recognized initially, which will measure the present value as a result of discounting the lease payments remaining at the borrowing rate in force on the day of initial application, the outstanding balance of which will be reduced by the payment of the lease payments remaining, plus interest expense,and (b) a right to use a fixed asset will be initially recognized by measuring that right in an amount that will be equal to the corresponding liability recognized.
After initial recognition, the Group and the Parent Company for new leases that will be signed after January 1st, 2019 a) will measure the rights to use fixed assets and will depreciate them at a constant rate throughout the duration of the lease and b) will measure the corresponding liability, forming the open balance in a way that will reflect interest and lease payments respectively.
Any impact of the application of the standard will be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as at January 1st 2019, without any change in comparative information.
Exceptions The Group and the Parent Company will make use of the exemption provided by the standard regarding the determination of leases, in other words will apply the requirements of IFRS 16 in all contracts in effect on January 1st 2019 and were recognized as leases according to IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. In addition, the Group and the Parent Company will use the exemptions of the standard for leases with a residual maturity of less than 12 months at the date of the original application of the standard and for leases of low value fixed assets (less than  5,000.00).
Prepayment Rate The discount rate to be used will be the current weighted average interest rate applicable on January 1st 2019, which the Parent Company uses in order to draw long-term borrowed funds.
Financial statements impact. In order to estimate the impact on financial statements of the Group and the Parent Company in 2019, an exercise was carried out conserning the existing lease agreements on December 31st 2018.

part ' / Financial Report

178

The initial estimation of expected impact for fiscal year 2019 on Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Income of the Group and the Parent Company is analyzed as follows:
· An estimated Initial Recognition of Right of Use assets and equivalent obligations from operating leases of approximately  121,006.09 for the Group and  50,543.38 for the Parent Company respectively,
· An estimated net decrease in operating expenses for lease payments of approximately  32,211.37 for the Group and approximately  16,460.90 for Parent Company respectively,
· An estimated increase in financial cost of use of approximately  4,605.18 for the Group and approximately 2,014.70 for Parent Company respectively,
· An estimated increase in depreciation of approximately  29,522.25 for the Group and approximately 15,363.16 for Parent Company respectively.
· Amendment in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
The amendments address an acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28, in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary. In December 2015 the IASB postponed the effective date of this amendment indefinitely, pending the outcome of its research project on the equity method of accounting. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· IFRS 9: Prepayment with negative compensation (Amendment)
The Amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019, while earlier application is permitted. The amendment specifies that pre-paid financial assets that allow or require a party to either pay or receive reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract (in the sense that the asset owner may be charged due to early repayment) may be measured at amortized cost or at fair value through the statement of other comprehensive income. The Amendment is not expected to have a substantial effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial statements.
· IAS 28: Long-Term Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments) The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019, while earlier application is permitted. The amendments relate to whether the measurement (and, in particular, impairment) of long-term investments in associates and joint ventures, which are in fact part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture, is governed by IFRS 9, IAS 28 or a combination of the two standards. The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 before applying IAS 28 to those long-term participations for which the equity method does not apply. When applying IFRS 9, an entity does not take into account any adjustments in the carrying amount of long-term investments arising from the application of IAS 28. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendments to its financial statements.

· IFRIC INTERPETATION 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments The Interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019, while earlier application is permitted. The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty. The Interpretation provides additional guidance on considering uncertain tax treatments separately or together, examination by tax authorities, the appropriate method to reflect uncertainty and accounting for changes in facts and circumstances. This Interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments)
The Amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019, while earlier application is permitted. The amendments require entities to use updated actuarial assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the annual reporting period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement has occurred. The amendments also clarify how the accounting for a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement affects applying the asset ceiling requirements. This Interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· Conceptual Framework of IFRS standards
The IASB issued the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting on March 29th 2018. The conceptual framework sets out a comprehensive set of concepts for financial reporting. These concepts help to define standards, guidance for preparers in developing consistent accounting policies and assistance to others in their efforts to understand and interpret the standards. IASB also issued a separate accompanying document, Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, which sets out the amendments to affected standards in order to update references to the revised Conceptual Framework. It's objective is to support transition to the revised Conceptual Framework for companies that develop accounting policies using the Conceptual Framework when no IFRS Standard applies to a particular transaction. For preparers who develop accounting policies based on the Conceptual Framework, it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2020.
· IFRS 3: Business Combinations (Amendments)
IASB issued amendments regarding the definition of a business (amendments to IFRS 3) in order to resolve difficulties that arise when an entity determines whether it has acquired a business or a group of assets. The amendments apply to business combinations for which the acquisition date is determined in the first annual reporting period commencing on or after January 1st 2020 and for the acquisition of assets that occur at or after the beginning of that period, while earlier application is permitted. The amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Significance (Amendments)
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2020, while earlier application is permitted. The amendments clarify the definition of materiality and the way it should be applied. The new definition states that "Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it

part ' / Financial Report

180

could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity." In addition, the explanations accompanying the definition of significance have improved. The amendments ensure that the definition of materiality is consistent across all IFRS standards. The amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union. The Group is in the process of assessing the effect of applying the amendments to its financial statements.
· The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015 ­ 2017 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1st 2019 while earlier application is permitted. The following amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements unless otherwise stated.
· IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: The amendments to IFRS 3 clarify that when an entity obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, it remeasures previously held interests in that business. The amendments to IFRS 11 clarify that when an entity obtains joint control of a business that is a joint operation, the entity does not re-measure previously held interests in that business.
· IAS 12 Income Taxes: The amendments clarify that the tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity should be recognized according to where the past transactions or events that generated distributable profits have been recognized.
· IAS 23 Borrowing Costs: The amendments clarify paragraph 14 of the standard so that when a qualifying asset is ready for its intended use or sale, and a portion of the borrowing made specifically to obtain that qualifying asset remains outstanding at that point, that outstanding borrowing should be treated as part of the funds that were borrowed generally.
3.3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The principle judgments and estimates referring to events, the development of which could significantly affect the items of the financial statements during the forthcoming twelve month period are as follows:
Post-retirement benefits a) The Parent Company provides to employees and pensioners of the Group electricity at a reduced tariff. The
reduced invoice to pensioners is recognized as a liability and is calculated as the present value of future retirement benefits deemed accrued by the end of the year on the basis of the rights of employees accumulated during their service and are calculated on the basis of an actuarial model on the basis of economic and actuarial assumptions. b) Pursuant to the provision of article 25 of Law 4491/66 "On the Insurance of PPC Staff", insured employees concluding their service on PPC who are entitled to pension, are paid an one-off aid, in proportion to the years of their actual service to PPC, which, according to the express provision of paragraph 3 of the same article, is offset against any compensation paid due to the termination of the contract of employment or reach of the age limit or another reason for leaving, according to the law.

Moreover, in the Personel Code of PPC, ratified by Article 2 of Law 210/1974 which is in force, and in particular Articles 34, 35, 36 and 37 thereof, it is stipulated that for the regular personnel of the Company, having for whatever reason their contract terminated (automatically or on termination of a contract of employment), compensation allowance is not due if they are entitled to a lump sum benefit from their insurance institution. If the lump sum benefit is less than the allowance, only the difference between the allowance and the lump sum is paid.
In any case, and when an employer is, in accordance with Article 2 § 1 of Law 173/1967, "The Greek Government or a Public Entity or Utility (PPC, OTE etc)" the severance pay of Law 2112/1920 which would be paid, if this was not the case, at the point of employees' withdrawal in any way from the Company, in subject to the aforementioned limitations that in accordance with article 33 of Law 1876/1990, as amended by the provisions of Article 21 § 13 of Law 3144/2003, is currently set at the amount of fifteen thousands (15,000) euros'. By virtue of Law 4533/2018 (OG A 7527/4/2018) the provision of paragraph 3 of Article 25 of Law 4491/1966 (OG A '1) was abolished as well as any other general or specific provision of law or regulation providing for the offsetting of the severance allowance of the employees with the lump-sum allowance to which they are entitled by their insurers.
Therefore, PPC and its subsidiaries will henceforth pay severance, which may not exceed Euro 15 (fifteen thousand Euro) to the insured employees who leave due to termination of their employment contract or reach the age limit, or any other reason the law provides.
This is a defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of IAS 19. The present value of the liability assumed by PPC and its subsidiaries upon the entry into force of the aforementioned law (through which the obligation to pay severance is triggered), calculated using actuarial methods, is a past service cost for a service provided in prior periods and amounted to Euro 104 million (Parent Company) and Euro 167 million (Group) and fully accounted for the results of the second quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the above mentioned obligation has been updated on December 31st 2018, using of the same actuarial methods.
Details of the underlying assumptions and estimates of the above mentioned post - retirement benefits are included in Note 30.
Fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment The Group carries its property, plant and equipment at revalued amounts (estimated fair values) as determined by an independent firm of appraisers. Revaluation is performed periodically (every three to five years). The determination of the fair values of property, plant and equipment requires from management to make assumptions, estimates and judgements with respect to the ownership, the value in use and the existence of any economic, functional and physical obsolescence of property, plant and equipment. On December 31st 2014, the Group has conducted its latest revaluation of property, plant and equipment. The management of the Group believe that any change in the fair value of tangible fixed assets will not have a significant impact on the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements of December 31st, 2018. Furthermore, the management makes estimates regarding the total and the remaining useful life of fixed assets which are subject to periodic review. Useful lives as estimated are included in Note 3.4.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a long ­ term asset may be impaired. The determination of whether such indications exists, requires from Management to make assumptions and judgments with respect to external and internal factors that may affect the recoverability of assets, as well as assumptions on the determination of the cash flow generating units.

Cost of dismantling of property, plant and equipment Based on the provisions of IAS 16 "Property, plant and equipment" the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes, among others, the initial estimate of the costs required for the dismantling and removal of such an item. These costs are quantified and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of IAS 37 "Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets". The management estimates that the cost of dismantling may, especially in the cases of lignite fired power plants as well as gas fired stations, be funded by the proceeds of the materials that will result from such a dismantling and, on that basis has not made any provision for such costs for all categories of the above mentioned power plants.
Provisions for risks The Group is establishing provisions concerning claims by third parties against companies of the Group and which might lead to an outflow of resources for their settlement. The provision is established based on amounts claimed and the possible outcome of the legal dispute.
Provisions for trade receivables With the adoption of IFRS 9 as of 01/01/2018, the Group and Parent Company apply the simplified approach set out in the Standard for the Calculation of Expected Credit Losses, according to which the provision for impairment is always measured in amount equal to the expected credit losses over the life of customer receivables. The provision for doubtful customer debts is formed for high voltage customers on a personalized basis in the assessment of the expected credit loss per customer, while for the estimation of the expected credit losses from middle and low voltage customers, credit loss provisioning tables are used based on the maturity of the balance, based on historical data of the Group and the Parent Company for credit losses and adjusted for future factors in terms of debtors and the economic environment. Additional details are contained in Notes 3.2 and 20.
Provisions for income taxes and recognition of deferred tax receivables Current provisions for income tax liabilities for current and prior years are calculated at the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities, using the prevailing tax rates at the balance sheet date. Provision for income tax includes current taxes reported in the respective income tax returns and potential additional tax assessments that may be imposed by the tax authorities upon settlement of the unaudited tax years on the basis of the findings of prior tax audits. Therefore, final settlement of the income taxes might differ from the income taxes that have been accounted for in the financial statements. From the year 2011 onwards, the Parent Company and several of its subsidiaries are audited for tax purposes by the Certified Auditors Accountants in accordance with the provisions of Income Tax Legislation. The audit for the year 2018 is ongoing and the relative tax conformity report will be issued after the publication of the financial statements for the year 2018. If, at the completion of the tax audit, additional tax liabilities arise, the Management estimates that these will have no material effect on the financial statements. Deferred taxes are recognized on carried forward tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will occur to offset carried forward tax losses. Deferred tax receivables that are recognized, require Management to make assessments as to the time and level of realization of future taxable profits.
Provision for unbilled revenue Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue from all types of electricity sales is accounted for on an accrual basis. Especially for low voltage customers at each balance sheet date, unbilled revenue is recorded to account for electricity delivered and consumed by these customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenue is estimated using certain assumptions with respect to quantities of electricity consumed, network losses and average electricity sale prices. The actual amounts that will be finally billed, may differ from those provided for. (Note 5)

Recognition of revenue from customers' contributions The Group and Parent Company estimates that customers' contributions refer to the initial and continuous connection to the distribution network which is a distinct service, separate from electricity sale. The service which is promised to be delivered is the only one to be executed by HEDNO and this transaction is considered a separate contractual obligation. Therefore, revenue from customers' contributions is recognized as the service is transferred to the customer. As the contract with the client is not of a specific time duration, the revenue is recognized based on the useful life of the distribution network fixed assets (35 years).
3.4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Foreign currency translation The functional and reporting currency of all the Group entities is the Euro. Transactions involving other currencies are converted into Euro using the exchange rates, which were in effect at the time of the transactions. At the balance sheet dates, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in other currencies are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency adjustments are reflected in foreign currency gains (losses), in the accompanying statements of income. Nonmonetary items in foreign currency which are valuated at acquisition cost are converted using the exchange rate of the date of acquisition. The non-monetary elements which are measured at fair value in foreign currency are converted using the exchange rate of the fair value's calculation date. The profit or loss from the conversion of non-monetary items is treated the same way as the profit or loss from the conversion of fair value of these elements.
Intangible assets Intangible assets include software and CO emission rights allowances.
Software Software programs are measured at their acquisition cost minus accumulated depreciation and impairments. In case of withdrawal or sale, the cost of acquisition and depreciation are written off. Any profit or loss resulting from the write-off is included in the Statement of Income. Software is depreciated using the straight line amortization method over a five-year period.
CO Emissions Rights Parent Company acquires CO emission rights in order to meet its obligation arising from the actual CO emissions of its production units. This liability is measured at fair value to the extent that Parent Company has the obligation to cover its emissions through purchases (after offset of any free CO emission rights held). Emission rights purchased and held are recognized as intangible assets, at their acquisition cost less any accumulated impairment loss.
Tangible Assets Tangible assets are initially recognised at their acquisition cost which includes all direct attributable expenses for their acquisition or construction. Subsequent to their initial recognition, tangible assets (with the exception of mines and lakes which are valued at cost minus accumulated depreciation and eliminations) are valued at fair value minus accumulated depreciation and impairment. Fair value estimates are performed periodically by independent appraisers (every three to five years) in order to ensure that fair value does not differ significantly from net value of the asset.
The latest estimate of fixed assets' was carried out on December 31st 2014. Any value increase is credited to the revaluation surplus net of deferred taxes. At the date of revaluation, accumulated depreciation is offset against pre depreciation accounting values and net amounts are restated according to revalued amounts. Any decrease

part ' / Financial Report

is first offset against an earlier valuation increase in respect of the same fixed asset and thereafter charged to the Statement of Income. Upon disposal of a revalued tangible asset, the relevant portion of the revaluation surplus is released from the revaluation surplus directly to retained earnings.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized if the criteria for recognizing them as tangible asset are met. For all assets withdrawn or sold, their acquisition cost and depreciation are written ­ off when sold or withdrawn. Any gain or loss resulting from the write ­ off is included in the Statement of Income.
Borrowing cost Since January 1st 2009, borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset that needs a substantial period of time to become available for its intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of aquiring that asset. The new accounting policy is implemented on fixed assets recognized from January 1st 2009 onwards (new constructions). All other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated residual useful life of the asset. The total useful life (in years) used for calculating depreciation is as follows:

Mining activities The Group and the Parent Company own and operate open-pit lignite mines. Land acquisition (mainly through expropriation) and initial (pre-operational) development costs relating to mines are capitalized and amortized (upon commencement of the mines' commercial operation) to the shortest period between mine life and a twenty (20) year period. Exploration, evaluation and ongoing development costs are added to the lignite production cost of fiscal year they occured. A provision for land restoration is established for the Group's estimated current obligation for restoration and is calculated based on the surface disturbed to date and the average cost of restoration per metric unit. That provision is recorded at present value of the related liability to restore land to a beneficial use and is included both in fixed assets (mines) and in provisions.

Investments in subsidiaries In the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are valued at cost less any impairment losses. The spin off and contribution of an activity from the Parent Company to a wholly owned subsidiary in exchange for shares, is accounted for as a transaction between companies under common control. In cases of such transactions the shares received are recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary with a value equivalent to the carrying value of the net assets contributed at the transaction date.
Investments in associates These are entities in which the Group has significant influence and which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Group. The Group's investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in associates are carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate, less possible provisions for any impairment in value. In case that the Group's share in an associate's losses is equal, or exceeds its participation in the associate, the Group does not recognise the losses exceeding its participation.
The Statement of Income reflects separately the Group's share on the results of its associates, while amounts that are recorded by the associates directly to their equity are recognized directly to the Group's equity. Non ­ realised profit or loss resulting from the transactions of the Group with said associates is eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates. The associates' accounting principles are adjusted, when necessary, in order to comply with those adopted by the Group. In the separate financial statements such investments are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash generating unit's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value , the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The fair value of sale (after the deduction of sales costs) is determined, in each case, according to the implementation of a revaluation model. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized to the Statement of Income, except if the particular asset is valued in fair values and then the impairment loss is recognised as a decrease of the already recognised surplus value. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets' recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.
part ' / Financial Report

186

That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation), if no impairment loss had been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in profit and loss unless the asset is carried at fair value amounts in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, to be divided equally to future time spans on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments such as derivatives, and fair value through other comprehensive income at each reporting date and non-financial assets such as property, periodically (every 3-5 years) at fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: · In the principal market for the asset or liability, or · In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: · Level 1 -- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. · Level 2 -- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
is directly or indirectly observable. · Level 3 -- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. The Group determines policies and procedures applied for both recurring measurements and assets held for distribution on operations held for sale. Assets of substantial value, as tangible assets as well as substantial value liabilities are evaluated by the Group and the Parent Company with the assistance of external valuators. External valuators involvement needs,

are annually decided by the Group, the selection criteria being market knowledge and expertise, reputation, independence and observance of professional standards. On each reporting date, the Group, according to its accounting policies, assesses if there is any change on the carrying values of assets and liabilities being subject to periodic reassessment and revaluation. For the above mentioned assessment, the management verifies considerable inputs applied to the last asset or liability evaluation, confirming data used for the evaluation against contracts and other relevant documents. For disclosing fair values, the Group's assets and liabilities are categorized according to their nature, characteristics, potential risks stemming from specific asset or liability categories, as well as fair value hierarchy described above.
Investments and financial assets Financial assets that fall under and are governed by the provisions of IFRS 9 are classified on initial recognition as financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the contractual characteristics of cash flows of the financial asset and the Group's business model for the management of that financial asset.
With the exception of trade receivables and receivables from electricity customers that do not contain a significant financial component, the Group initially evaluates the financial assets at their fair value plus, in case of a financial asset that is not valued through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not have a significant financial component and also receivables from electricity customers are valued at the transaction price determined in accordance with IFRS 15. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value other comprehensive income, the resulting cash flows should be "Solely for Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) "n the initial capital. The Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to the way in which it manages its financial capabilities in order to generate cash flows. Business model determines whether cash flows arise from collection of contractual cash flows, sale of financial assets, or both. Usual sales and purchases of financial assets are recognized on the transaction date (on which Group is committed to purchase the financial asset). Usual purchases or sales involve purchases or sales of financial assets that require physical receipt of items within the period and are also governed by a law or a purchase agreement.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost Non-depreciated cost of a financial asset is defined as the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition less the capital repayments plus or minus the cumulative depreciation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the amortized cost adjusted for any loss provision. A financial asset is measured at amortized cost only if both of the following are met unless it is measured at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition: i. The financial asset is held in a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets for the collection of
contractual cash flows ("HTC") and, ii. The contractual terms of the financial asset result in specific dates in cash flows that are only capital and
interest payments on the outstanding initial capital. Consequently, the Group classifies financial assets at amortized cost when financial assets are held in the context of a business model with a view to being held to maturity mostly concentrating their contractual cash flows, and these financial data lead to cash flows

part ' / Financial Report

188

consisting only of capital and interest payments. Financial assets that do not meet the above conditions are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, with the exception of investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading and for which is selected to be measured at financial assets fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition.
The Group, after initial recognition, measures financial assets of this category at amortized cost using effective interest rate. These financial assets are subject to impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. Profit and loss are recognized in Statement of Income when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments) Upon initial recognition, the Group may choose to irrevocably classify its equity investments as equity instruments which are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they comply with the definition of equity as stated in "IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation" and are not held for sale, but it has been chosen for them to be retained with a long-term perspective to serve strategic choices. Classification is determined by financial instrument. Profit and loss from these financial assets remain in equity and are not reclassified to Statement of Income after the recognition has ceased. Dividends are recognized as other income in the Statement of Income when payment right has been established, unless the Group benefits from such revenue by recovering part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case profit is recognized in comprehensive Statement of Income. Equity instruments that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not subject to impairment.
The Group chose to classify as of 01/01/2018 in financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income all debt securities classified as " Investments Available for sale" on December 31st 2017 according to IAS 39.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless it is measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Any financial asset whose contractual terms do not result in specific cash flow dates that are only capital and interest payments on the outstanding initial capital are classified by the Group at fair value through profit or loss (unless it is an investment in an equity instrument that is classified at fair value through other comprehensive income). Since the option to determine a financial asset at fair value at its initial recognition is irrevocable, if a financial asset is designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition, the Group does not reclassify it as measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income in case the business model changes.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are transferred to the statement of financial position at their fair value, and changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded in the Statement of Income. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are not subject to impairment.
Impairment of Financial Assets Group assesses at each reporting date whether the value of a financial asset or group of financial assets has been impaired in accordance with provisions of IFRS 9.

Since January 1, 2018, the Group has adopted the expected credit losses model for (expected loss) for each of the following asset categories.
· Trade Receivables from the sale of electricity to customers · Other financial assets measured at amortized cost. · Contract assets · Contract liabilities
Trade Receivables from the sale of electricity to customers The Group and the Parent Company apply the simplified approach of IFRS 9 for the calculation of expected credit losses as of January 1st 2018, according to which the provision for impairment is always measured at the amount of the expected credit losses over the lifetime of trade receivables. More specifically: i) Regarding the receivables of High Voltage (HV) customers from the sale of energy, the Group and the Parent
Company (due to the individual characteristics of each client and its credit behavior) evaluate the expected credit loss from each customer individualy.
ii) Regarding the receivables from Medium Volatage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) customers from the sale of energy, the Group and the Parent Company, considering these contracts as sharing similar characteristics, classified them into two distinct portfolios (Medium and Low Voltage) and for estimating the expected credit losses credit maturity forecasts are used based on the maturity of their balances, following the historical data of the Group and the Parent Company for credit losses and adjusting appropriately for future events and the economic environment.
Other financial assets measured at amortized cost For the other financial assets of the Group and the Parent Company, measured at amortized cost, the general approach is used. These financial assets are considered as having low credit risk and any provision for loss is limited to the expected credit losses for the next 12 months from the respective reporting date
Inventories Inventories include consumables, materials, lignite and liquid fuel.
Materials and consumables Materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which takes under consideration the net realizable value of the end product in which they are incorporated. The cost is determined using the weighted average method. These materials are recorded in inventory when purchased and then are expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when installed.
Lignite (self-produced and purchased) The cost of lignite inventories which have been excavated/purchased but not yet consumed at the date of the financial statements is stated at the balance sheet. Lignite inventories are stated at the lower of production cost /purchase cost and net realizable value, which takes under consideration the net realizable value of the end product in which they are incorporated with the cost being determined using the weighted average production /purchase cost method. Production/purchase cost mainly consists of expenses incurred in order for lignite inventories to be used for electricity generation.
Liquid fuel Liquid fuel is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value which takes under consideration the net realisable value of the finished product in which it is incorporated. The cost of liquid fuel reflects purchase price plus any

part ' / Financial Report

190

taxes (excluding VAT), levies and any other type of expense for the fuel to be stored in the Group warehouses and determined using the weighted average method. Liquid fuels are expensed on consumption and appear separately in the Statement of Income.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group considers time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less, to be cash equivalents.
Share capital Share capital reflects the value of the Parent Company's shares fully issued and are in circulation. Any proceeds in excess of par value are recorded in share premium. Expenses related directly to new shares issuance are recognized directly to Equity net of proceeds.
De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial Receivables Financial receivables (or, where applicable a part of a financial receivable or part of a group of similar financial receivables) are derecognized when: (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, (2) The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement and (3) The Parent Company/ Group has transferred the right to receive cash from that asset while either: (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, or (b) has not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards but has transferred control of that asset. Where the Group has transferred the rights to receive cash inflows from that asset but has not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards or control of that asset, then the asset is recognized to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to pay. Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchase option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Group's continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discontinued, cancelled or expires. In the event that an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss statement.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet only when the Group has the legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to either settle such asset and liability on a net basis or claim the asset and settle the liability at the same time.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at cost, which reflects the fair value of the amount received less the cost of borrowing. After initial recognition, they are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. For the calculation of amortized cost, all types of borrowing and issue costs are taken into account.

Provisions for Risks and Expenses, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Claims Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal, contractual or constructive obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that they will be cleared through outflows of resources and the estimate of the exact amount of the liability can be reliably made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the present value of the expence expected to be required to settle the liability. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is minimal. Contingent claims are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed when the inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Post-retirement benefits a) The Parent Company provides to employees and pensioners of the Group electricity at a reduced tariff. The
reduced invoice to pensioners is recognized as a liability and is calculated as the present value of future retirement benefits deemed accrued by the end of the year on the basis of the rights of employees accumulated during their service and are calculated on the basis of an actuarial model on the basis of economic and actuarial assumptions. b) PPC and its subsidiaries will pay, in accordance with Law 4533/2018 (OG A 7527/4/2018), retirement compensation, which may not exceed Euro 15 (fifteen thousand Euros) to insured persons who leave due to termination of the employment contract, due to the age limit, or other cause specified by the law (see Note 3.3 for further clarification). Net expence for the period is included in payroll cost in the Statement of Income and consist of the present value of the benefits earned in the year. The post-retirement benefit liability is not funded. Actuarial gains or losses are directly recognized in other comprehensive income.
Subsidies for fixed assets The Group receives grants from the Greek State and the European Union (through the public investment program of the Greek State) in order to finance specific projects that are executed within certain time periods. Subsidies are accounted for when they are collected and are shown in the balance sheet as deferred income. Amortization is recognized based on the remaining useful life of the related assets and is included in depreciation in the Statement of Income.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Parent Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks arising from fluctuations from exchange rates and liquid fuel prices it consumes.
The Group has not adopted the requirements arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 in respect of hedge accounting but has continued to apply IAS 39.
Such derivative financial instruments are valued at fair value at the balance sheet date. The fair value of such derivatives is determined by reference to fair values for similar instruments and is confirmed with the respective financial institutions with which the Parent Company has concluded the relative contacts. The effective part of hedges that qualify for hedge accounting is recognized to OCI if it is related to cash flow hedges while the ineffective part is charged to the separate Statement of Income. If the hedge is related to effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in profit or loss and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss. Under cash flow hedge accounting, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognized the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognized in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other

part ' / Financial Report

192

cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognized in equity are transferred to the Statement of Income in the same year in which the hedged transaction affects the net profit and loss. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the year.
Certain derivatives, although characterized as effective hedges based on the Group's policies, do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39 and, therefore, gains or losses are recognized in the Statement of Income.
Income taxes (current and deferred)
Current Income Taxes Current income tax expense consists of income taxes for the current year based on the Parent Company's profits and on the other companies of the Group as adjusted in their tax returns and, provisions for additional income taxes to cover potential tax assessments which are likely to occur from tax audits by the tax authorities, using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income tax is calculated, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base and the book value of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except where the deferred income tax liability arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or of a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences carried forward as well as unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is possible that taxable profit will be available against the deductible temporary differences and the carried forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized. No deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences is recognized when it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are reduced at the time where it is not considered possible that enough taxable profits will be presented against which, a part or the total of assets can be utilized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive income and not in the Statement of Income.
Defined contribution plans The Parent Company and the Group recognize as an expense the contribution for the employees' services payable to EFKA (Greek Single Social Security Institution) (ex IKA ­ETAM /TAP DEH, ETEA, TAYTEKO) (defined contribution plans) and as a liability the amount that has not been paid yet.
Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of electricity to customers The Group and the Parent Company are active in the supply of electricity to high, medium and low voltage customers through the Operations electricity Supply Sector. Given the particular characteristics of electricity,

the Group and the Parent Company consider that their customers buying electricity simultaneously receive and spend on the benefits resulting from the sale of electricity as the Parent Company fulfills its contractual obligations. For this reason, revenue recognition (as long as the collection of the total amounts is considered probable) is made at the point of issuing the electricity bill/invoice. The Group and the Parent Company also estimate whether they pay the part of principal or representative in any relevant agreement. The Group's and the Parent Company's assessment is that they have the role of principal in all of its sales transactions. If the price agreed under the contract also includes a variable portion, this amount is recognized as revenue to the extent that it is unlikely that that amount will be reversed in the future.
Revenue from NOME quantities Revenue from futures products (NOME) is recognized at the time of delivery of those future products' quantities. The difference between the quantities of electicity delivered by the Company for fulfilling its liability for futures (NOME) is recognized at the time of delivery and not before that (for the total time of each auction), because this difference can not be measured reliably before delivery time.
Contract Assets At each reporting date and taking into account that the invoicing based on the measurement data of the last month of the period is issued during the first days of the following month, as far as High and Medium Voltage customers are conserned, the total value of electricity provided that month is recognized as accrued revenue for the period, and is reversed in the following month, after billing has already been recorded in books. These accruals at the end of each reporting period are classified as "Contract Assets". Additionally, at each reporting date, the Parent Company estimates the value of the consumed and non-invoiced electricity from Low Voltage customers, since it has developed an estimation method especially for doing so. The estimated values are recorded as income receivable for periods ending on the reporting date and are reversed during the following month. Those accruals are also classified as " Contract Assets" at the end of each reporting period.
Contract Liabilities If the customer pays a fee, or the Group and the Parent Company reserves an unconditional right to a sum of money, before the Group and the Parent Company tranferring the goods or services to the customer, it is recording the contract as a contract liability to the customer, either when the payment is made or when it becomes chargeable (whichever comes first). For the Group and the Parent Company, contract liabilities come mainly from: · Customers' contributions · Payments in advance against electricity consumption paid by customers at the time of signing the electricity
supply contract. · An advance payment of 3% or 5% on the value of the electricity provided through NOME auctions, which are
paid by the participants in the NOME auctions to the Parent Company. · Prepayments paid by customers against future consumption of electricity.
Customers' contibutions Consumers or producers connected to the distribution network are required to participate in the initial cost of connecting to the network (meters, lines, substations, etc.) or other types of infrastructure by paying institutionally fixed amounts of money or by contributing fixed assets (extremely rare cases). It is noted that all the facilities that are constructed are under the exclusive ownership and possession of the Parent Company by contract, and in case a customer leaves a facility and a new customer enters, that new customer is not obliged to pay for a new contribution.

part ' / Financial Report

194

Customers' contributions are classified as "Long­ term contract liabilities". Revenue from customers' contributions is recognized on the basis of the remaining useful life of distribution network's fixed assets and is included in "Revenue".
Payments in advance against electricity consumption paid by customers at the time of signing the electricity supply contract. By signing the electricity supply contract, the customer is required to pay an advance - a guarantee against future electricity consumption. This amount is not refunded to the customer but is offset by the amount of the last clearing account following the request for suspention of electricity supply to the customer. Concidering that these amounts are settled in a period over 12 months, the Group and Parent Company classified them as "Long ­ term Contract Liabilities"
An advance payment of 3% or 5% on the value of the electricity provided through NOME auctions, which are paid by the participants in the NOME auctions to the Parent Company. During the NOME-type auctions for futures products, which are executed every three months and involve the Parent Company's sale of electricity futures on the wholesale market for a period of 12 months, the electricity suppliers pay in advance 3% or 5% of the value of electricity, awarded to them. These prepayments are classified as "Short ­ term contract liabilities" as they are settled in less than 12 months. Revenue is recognized on an equal basis per month according to the quantities delivered to alternative electricity suppliers.
Prepayments paid by customers against future consumption of electricity. The Parent Company gives the opportunity to Medium & Low Voltage customers (for High Voltage customers this possibility is included in their contract) to pre-pay the annual electricity consumption against a discount on the price of electricity. The received amounts are classified as "Short ­ term Contract Liabilities " as they are settled within 12 months, whereas revenue recognition is based on the pricing of the consumed or estimated Electricity.
Interest income Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis
Dividend income Dividend income is recognized when it has been approved by the relevant authority of the company that distributes it.
Electricity Electricity costs are expensed as purchased and presented separately in the Statement of Income.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right or use the asset.
Group as a lessee Leases, which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as revenue in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Earnings/ (Losses) per share The basic and diluted earnings per share, are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the relevant year. The weighted average number of shares is derived by adding the existing shares, that the share capital is divided, with the rights that the Parent Company owns and potentially could exercise.
Subsequent events Post period-end events that provide additional information about the Group's position at the balance sheet date (adjusting events), are reflected in the financial statements. Post-period-end events that are not adjusting events are disclosed in the notes.
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations The Group classifies a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale, if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. In sale transactions, all exchanges of non­current assets for other non­current assets are included, if the transaction has a commercial substance.
The basic requirements for a non-current asset (or a disposal group) to be classified as held for sale are that it must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets/groups and its sale must be highly probable.
Immediately, before the original classification of the non - current asset or disposal group as held for sale , the current asset or disposal group is evaluated according to the adopted IFRS's at the date of classification. Non - current assets (or a group of assets and liabilities) classified as held for sale will be measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and any possible resulting impairment losses will be recognized in the Statement of Income. Any subsequent increase in fair value will be recognized in the Statement of Income, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss which was previously recognized. No depreciation or amortization is recognized on a non-current asset (or non-current assets that are included in a disposal group) from the date that is classified as held for sale.
Operating Segment According to L. 4001/2011, the Group as a vertically integrated undertaking is obliged to prepare and integrate in its financial statements, accounting unbundled financial statements for each segment. These include the Parent Company's activities in the Sectors of Mines, Generation, Distribution and Supply. In 2011, the Transmission activity was transferred to IPTO which is a PPC's subsidiary, according to the model of the Independent Transmission Operator and all organizational units as well as activities of HTSO that pertained to management, operation, development and maintenance of the Transmission System apart from the Daily Ahead Schedule. In 2012 the Distribution Activity was transferred to HEDNO. By the contribution of the General Division of Distribution as well as the Department of Islands' Region, to its subsidiary HEDNO, PPC has maintained the ownership of the fixed assets as well as the assets of the Distribution Network and the Non- Interconnected Islands' Network.

9. EMISSION ALLOWANCES (CO)
According to the current European and National legislation, during the 3rd implementation phase of the EU ETS (period 2013-2020), PPC is not entitled to free allocation of emission allowances for its bound stations, with the exception of allowances allocated for emissions corresponding to the generation of thermal power for district heating.
In accordance with its verified CO emissions for 2017, the emission allowances that PPC delivered for the period January 1st 2017 to December 31st 2017 amounted to 31.74 Mt. During 2017, PPC has been allocated with about 62.77 thousand emission allowances for district heating emissions.
Based on provisional ex-post data, the total CO emissions of the Parent Company's bound plants as well as of the disinvested subsidiaries "LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A." and "LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A." for the period 01.01.2018 ­ 31.12.2018 amount to 29.52 Mt. It should be noted that the CO emissions of 2018 will be considered final by the end of March 2019, when the verification of the annual emissions reports for the year 2018 by accredited third party verifiers will be completed. Based on the above, the total CO emissions that PPC Group will have to deliver for the period 01.01.2018 ­ 31.12.2018 amount to 29.52 Mt. The CO emission rights' deficit consumptions are as follows :

According to tax legislation, the income tax rate for legal entities residing in Greece, is 29% for 2018, and at the same time tax prepayment stands to 100%, while for the subsequent fiscal years on the basis of the recent law 4579/2018 article 23 is set (28%) on the income of the fiscal year 2019, (27%) on the income of the fiscal year 2020, (26%) on the income of the fiscal year 2021 and (25%) on the income of the fiscal year 2022 and of the subsequent years. Tax returns for the companies residing in Greece are filed annually but profits or losses declared for tax purposes remain provisional until the tax authorities audit the returns and the records of the company and a final assessment is issued. The Group establishes a provision, if deemed necessary, on a case by case basis and per company, against an event of additional taxes being imposed by the tax authorities.

Based on the applicable Income Tax Code, since the fiscal year 2011, the Statutory Auditors issue an "Annual Tax Compliance Report" after conducting a tax audit at the same time with the financial audit. The tax audit is conducted on particular tax areas, specified by an audit program, according to the provisions of the tax law. Audit matters which are not covered by the above mentioned decision are dealt in accordance to the ISAE 3000 "Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information". From 01/01/2016 and onwards, according to Law 4410/2016, the issue of the tax certificate became optional, however, the Company continues to apply the procedure for its issue by the Statutory Auditors.
The tax audit of the Parent Company for the fiscal year 2017 was completed by its Statutory Auditors and the Parent Company received a tax certificate with "unqualified conclusions".
On December 29th 2017 the tax audit by the Centre for Auditing Big Companies of the Parent Company's fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 was completed and the final assessment for the fiscal year 2011 was issued imposing taxes and fines of an amount of Euro 10.5 mil. Fiscal years 2009 and 2010 were time-barred.
The Parent Company paid the amount of taxes and fines imposed and it resorted to the Administrative Courts.
Tax unaudited years for the Parent Company and the subsidiaries of the Group are presented in the following table:

Revaluation of Fixed Assets: Within 2014, the Group proceeded with the revaluation of its operating fixed assets as of December 31st, 2014. The revaluation was carried out by an independent firm of appraisers, according to IAS 16 and IFRS 13. The results of the above appraisal which excluded lakes, land for the extraction of lignite and construction in progress, were recorded in the Company's books on December 31st, 2014. The previous revaluation took place on December 31st, 2009.
The revalued amounts, from the appraisers' work, compared to the Net Book Value of the fixed assets, resulted to a net surplus for the Group, amounting to approximately Euro 672.4 mil., (Parent Company 627.5 mil.), which was credited directly in Revaluation Surplus in Comprehensive Income (Euro 848 mil. and Euro 818.6 mil. net of Deferred Taxes for the Group and the Parent Company, respectively). Additionally, an amount of Euro 44.8 mil. which was not offset by previous years' Revaluation Surplus was charged in the Statement of Income for the year ended at December 31st, 2014 (Parent Company: Euro 21.7 mil.).
Encumbrances on tangible assets: Tangible assets are held free from encumbrances and any claims against the Group's tangible assets are deemed as not substantial.

All transactions with government owned entities are performed at arm's length terms and are not disclosed.
- On 02.07.2018 an amount of Euro 538,300 was paid by the State Treasury to PPC SA. This amount will be reimbursed gradually after the payment of the electricity bills by the General Government entities and will be completed on April 30th 2019. On 12.03.2019 an amount of Euro 550,700 was paid by the State Treasury to PPC SA and it will be reimbursed in the same way until April 30th 2020.
- For the collection of electricity bills, PPC also cooperates with the Hellenic Post (ELTA), which has the license required by law. The balance of the amounts collected from electricity bills that ELTA S.A. had not timely paid to PPC until 31.12.2018 amounted to Euro 15,686. The above amount includes all charges listed in the electricity bills issued by PPC. Within the first quarter of 2019, an amount of Euro 12,279, which concerned the total liability of ELTA S.A. from collection of electricity bills which were not paid to PPC, was offset with equal debts or payments by the parent company in the context of the provision of Postal Services for collection, sorting and distribution of PPC's postal items throughout the Hellenic Territory by ELTA.

High voltage customer balances relate to (a) receivables from sales of energy to 58 companies with 91 installations (or power supplies), including large industrial companies, which are invoiced at the end of each calendar month, based on individual agreements and actual metering and (b) receivables from exports to customers abroad.
Medium voltage customers are mainly industrial and commercial companies. Billing is made on a monthly basis based on actual meter readings. Low voltage customers are mainly residential and small commercial companies. The majority of low voltage customers are billed every four months based on actual meter readings, while interim bills are issued every two months based mainly on the energy consumed during the corresponding period in the prior year.
There are different types of tariffs for both medium and low voltage customers with different tariff structures based on different types of energy use (commercial, residential, etc). On 01.01.2018 the Group and the Parent Company applying the provisions of IFRS 15, reclassified the "Unbilled revenue" to the "Contract Assets" (Note 3 & Note 21) The provision for expected credit losses for the High voltage customers is established by making a personalized assessment of the expected credit loss per customer.
For the determination of expected credit losses with respect to receivables from Medium and Low voltage customers, the Group and the Parent Company use credit loss provision table based on the ageing of the balances, based on the historical data of the Group and the Parent Company for credit losses, adjusted for future factors with respect to debtors and the economic environment.
The movement of the provision for expected credit losses is as follows:

As at January 1 - Transfer part of provision to contract assets (effect of IFRS 15) - Effect of IFRS 9 As at January 1 - Increase/(decrease) in provision As at December 31

Revenues from the supply of power to High, Medium and Low voltage customers during the interval from the last measurement or billing until the reporting date are accounted for as energy consumed but not yet billed (unbilled revenue). At each reporting date and taking into account that the billing which is based on measurement data of the last month of the period, is carried out in the first days of the next month with respect to High and Medium Voltage customers, the total value of energy of that month is recognized as accrued income for the period, which is reversed in the following month, after billing has already been accounted for. Additionally, at each reporting date, the Parent Company calculates the unbilled revenue from Low Voltage customers, having developed a specific calculation method. The resulting amounts are accounted for as accrued income for the periods ending until the reporting date and reversed in the next month. All accrued income from the energy consumed but not yet billed is impaired at each reporting date with provision for expected credit losses. This provision is calculated on the basis of the possibility of default for non-past due trade receivables, arising from the expected credit loss provision table.
On 01.01.2018 the Group and the Parent Company applying the provisions of IFRS 15, reclassified the "Unbilled revenue" from the "Trade Receivables" to the "Contract Assets" (Note 3 & Note 20)
The movement of the provision for expected credit losses on the value of the unbilled revenue is as follows:

Assessed taxes and penalties:
The amount represents additional income taxes and penalties assessed to the Parent Company.
An amount of Euro 29,687 corresponds to a paid special consumption tax with recourse. In the framework of an audit conducted by Audit Department of the Customs House for the period May 2010 to September 2012, an Imputation Act (Nr. 80/14/07.07.2015) of the Head of the 4th Customs Supervision Assembly of Piraeus was issued, which charged the Company with special consumption tax amounting Euro 9,790 which corresponds to self-consumption quantities for the audited period to Electricity Transmission System due to noncompliance with the terms and formalities mentioned in the Ministerial Decision (.50257772010/17.6.2010) on the matter.

The Company paid the charged amounts and, at the same time, appealed against the aforementioned act before the Piraeus Administrative Court of Appeals, but since then compliant with the instructions of Ministry of Finance, PPC includes the self-consumption quantities of electricity in the Special Consumption Tax Statements which submits and pays with recourse the relevant tax, while simultaneously files a lawsuit.
An amount of Euro 10,555 corresponds to amounts paid, which were imposed by the regular audit from the Centre for Auditing Big Companies for the years 2009-2011 Following a regular tax audit from the Centre for Auditing Big Companies, various accounting differences were added to the Company's taxable profits for the fiscal year 2012 (reporting period 01.01.2011-31.12.2011) and an income tax plus an inaccuracy tax totaling Euro 462 was charged.
A Fine of Withholding Tax of Euro 9,855 was imposed on the ground that PPC in the same fiscal year 2012 issued false salary statements to its staff, since it did not include the employees' benefits from the supply of electricity at reduced tariffs. Finally, two fines of Euro 900.00 were imposed due to late issue of purchase invoices and Euro 500.00 due to providing incomplete data to audit. The surcharges amounted to Euro 237.
On 24.01.2018, against the aforementioned corrective acts an appeal was filed before the Dispute Resolution Division of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue. The latter did not issue a decision on the case and the Company filed an appeal before the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal on 25.06.2018. This appeal was heard on 19.01.2019 and the decision is pending.
For the amounts of Euro 29,687 and Euro 10,555 an equal provision has been established in the Financial Statements 2018.
Social Security Funds in Dispute The amount relates to social security contributions and deductions (during years 1983-1993) for employees who have worked with other employers before joining PPC. As PPC undertook the obligation to cover the whole amount of their pensions and other related benefits, part of their contributions to other social security funds mainly IKA (SSI i.e. Social Security Institute which is the major Greek social security fund) has been claimed by PPC.
Since the claim was not accepted by IKA, PPC resorted to the courts. Following an adverse court decision, PPC together with PPC ­ PIO (currently EFKA, Greek Single Social Security Institution) appealed against said decision. The court rejected PPC's appeal, whereas PPC ­ PIO's (currently EFKA, Greek Single Social Security Institution) appeal against IKA is still pending. For the abovementioned amount, an equal provision has been established at the attached financial statements.
Advances to Pensioners in Dispute The amount of Euro 5,262 represents an advance payment made in 1993 to pensioners. An equal provision has been established of this amount.
State Participation in Employees' Social Security Contributions: The amount represents the State's contribution to the social security contributions of employees who started working after January 1, 1993. For the above mentioned amount, an equal provision has been established.

From the above amount, 1,976 is not related to loan agreements.
25. SHARE CAPITAL
Under Law 2773/1999 and P.D. 333/2000 PPC was transformed, into a société anonyme. By the Legislative Act of 07.09.2012, which was ratified by art. 2 of L. 4092/2012, the obligatory participation of the Greek State with at least 51% of the company's share capital was abolished. The Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting, which was convened on November 30th, 2012 decided to abolish the article of incorporation which provided for the participation of the Greek State by at least 51% to the company's share capital. This amendment of the Articles of Incorporation on one hand harmonizes the articles with the legislation in effect, and on the other hand renders possible the reduction of the current participation percentage of the Greek State to the company's share capital.
At December 31st, 2016, PPC's share capital (fully authorised and issued) amounted to Euro 1,067,200 divided into 232,000,000 common shares of Euro four and sixty cents (Euro 4.60) per value each.
The Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting with its decision on 17.01.2017 and in the context of the distribution to the existing PPC's shareholders of the shares held by PPC in the "Holding Company ENERGIAKI S.A."(ENERGIAKI HOLDING S.A., and then ADMIE HOLDING) according to Law 4389/2016 (carve out), approved (a) the decrease of PPC's share capital by Euro 491,840 "with the purpose of the distribution in Kind to its shareholders" and (b) as a consequence of the above mentioned distribution in Kind, the transfer to its existing shareholders of the shares held by PPC in the "ENERGIAKI HOLDING S.A." in proportion to their participation in PPC's share capital. This decrease achieved by means of decreasing the nominal value of the PPC's shares from Euro four and sixty cents (Euro 4.60) per value each to Euro two and forty-eight cents (Euro 2.48).
After this decrease, on 31.12.2017 PPC's share capital amounts to Euro 575,360 divided into 232,000,000 common shares of Euro two and forty-eight cents (Euro 2.48) per value each.
On March 20th, 2018, the automatic and free of charge transfer of 79,165,114 PPC's shares (34.123%) by the Greek State to Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations S.A. (HCAP) was completed, in implementing the provisions of par. 20 of Article 380 of L.4512 / 2018, as amended the paragraph 1 of Article 197 of Law 4389/2016. It is noted that, following the above change, HCAP S.A. holds directly the 34,123% of PPC's shares and indirectly the 17% through HRADF. The total percentage of voting rights of HCAP S.A. is 51.123%. The total percentage of the Greek State, remains indirectly as above 51.123%.
26. LEGAL RESERVE
Under Greek corporate law, corporations are required to transfer a minimum of 5% of their annual net profit as reflected in their financial statements to a legal reserve, until such reserve equals one-third of the paid-in share capital. This reserve cannot be distributed through the life of the corporation.

28. DIVIDENDS
Pursuant to the provisions of the Code for Societe Anonyme L.4548/18, companies are required to pay dividends of at least 35% of after-tax profit, after necessary deductions for the formation of the legal reserve, and other credit accounts in the income statement that do not arise from realized earnings. By decision of the General Meeting which is obtained with an increased quorum and majority that rate may be reduced, but not below 10%. The non-distribution of a dividend is possible by decision of the General Meeting of Shareholders, in which shareholders representing half (1/2) of the paid-up capital are present or represented thereat, and obtained by a majority of 80% of the capital represented in the meeting. Furthermore, Greek corporate law (L. 4548/18 art. 159) requires certain conditions to be met for the dividend distribution.
Based on L. 4172/2013, the distributable earnings approved by the General Meetings are subject to a withholding tax of 15% since 01.01.2017. Following the latest amendment of tax law, the withholding tax is reduced to 10% since 01/01/2019.
Given that the fiscal year 2018 was closed at a loss, there is no mandatory the distributing of the minimum dividend, in accordance with article 161 of Law 4548/2018, as in force.

30. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
a) SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AT REDUCED TARIFFS
The Group's employees and pensioners are entitled to the supply of electricity (which the Parent Company provides) at reduced tariffs. Such reduced tariffs to pensioners are considered to be retirement obligations and are calculated at the discounted value of the future retirement benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end based on the employees earning retirement benefit rights steadily throughout the working period. The relevant retirement obligations are calculated on the basis of financial and actuarial assumptions. Net costs for the period are included in the payroll cost in the accompanying income statement consisting of the present value of the benefits earned in the year, interest cost on the benefit obligation, as well as prior service cost. The actuarial gains or losses are now recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) based on the revised IAS 19 (effective from 2013). Retirement benefit obligations are not funded. Results of the actuarial study for the years December 31st 2018 and 2017, are as follows:

b) PROVISION FOR SEVERANCE PAY
Pursuant to the provision of article 25 of Law 4491/66 "On the Insurance of PPC Staff", insured employees concluding their service on PPC who are entitled to pension, are paid an one-off aid, in proportion to the years of their actual service to PPC , which, according to the express provision of paragraph 3 of the same article, is offset against any compensation paid due to the termination of the contract of employment or reach of the age limit or another reason for leaving, according to the law.
Moreover, in the Personell Code of PPC, ratified by Article 2 of Law 210/1974 which is in force, and in particular Articles 34, 35, 36 and 37 thereof, it is stipulated that for the regular personnel of the Company, having for whatever reason their contract terminated (automatically or on termination of a contract of employment), compensation allowance is not due if they are entitled to a lump sum benefit from their insurance institution. If the lump sum benefit is less than the allowance, only the difference between the allowance and the lump sum is paid.
In any case, and when an employer is, in accordance with Article 2 § 1 of Law 173/1967, "The Greek Government or a Public Entity or Utility (PPC, OTE etc) "the severance pay of Law 2112/1920 which would be paid, if this was not the case, at the point of employees' withdrawal in any way from the Company, in subject to the aforementioned limitations that in accordance with article 33 of Law 1876/1990, as amended by the provisions of Article 21 § 13 of Law 3144/2003, is currently set at the amount of fifteen thousands (15,000) euros'. By virtue of Law 4533/2018 (OG A 7527/4/2018) the provision of paragraph 3 of Article 25 of Law 4491/1966 (OG A'1) was abolished as well as any other general or specific provision of law or regulation providing for the offsetting of the severance allowance of the employees with the lump-sum allowance to which they are entitled by their insurers.
Therefore, PPC and its subsidiaries will henceforth pay severance, which may not exceed Euro 15 (fifteen thousand Euro) to the insured employees who leave due to termination of their employment contract or reach the age limit, or any other reason the law provides.
This is a defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of IAS 19. The present value of the liability assumed by PPC and its subsidiaries upon the entry into force of the aforementioned law (through which the obligation to pay severance is triggered), calculated using actuarial methods, is a past service cost for a service provided in prior periods and incurred entirely in the income statement for the second quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the above obligation has been updated by date 31/12/2018 using the same actuarial methods.

The actuarial study results for the calculation of the severance liability for the year ended December 31st 2018 are as follows:

39. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION
Ownership of Property
Major matters relating to the ownership of the Group's assets, are as follows:
1. The Parent Company has completed the registration of its property. These assets (almost entirely) are registered at the relevant land registries over the country and the cadastral application is monitored. The update of the existent in the company new integrated information system for fixed assets management is in progress.
2. In a number of cases, expropriated land, as presented in the expropriation statements, differs (in quantitative terms), with what the Parent Company considers as its property.
3. Agricultural land acquired by the Parent Company through expropriation in order to be used for the construction of hydroelectric power plants, must be transferred to the State at no charge, following a decision of the Parent Company's Board of Directors and a related approval by the Ministry of Development, if such land is no longer needed by the Parent Company for the fulfilment of its purposes according to article 9, of Law 2941/01.
4. According to article 15 of Law 4273/14 (O.G./A/146), the compulsory expropriation of real estate in areas where exclusive research and exploitation rights have been granted to PPC SA, are declared in favor of the Greek State with expenses of the applicant who declared the expropriation. Following the completion of expropriation, the aforementioned areas are transferred to the Greek State's ownership and PPC (which pays the compensations) uses them for the mining of lignite deposit.
The property, plant and equipment of the Group are located all over Greece. The Group does not carry any form of insurance coverage on its fixed assets in operation (except for its information technology equipment), resulting to the fact that if a sizable damage is incurred to its property, it might affect its profitability. Materials, spare parts as well as liabilities against third parties are not insured.

LITIGATION AND CLAIMS
The Group is a defendant in several legal proceedings arising from its operations. The total amount claimed as at December 31st 2018, amounts to Euro 1,494 mil. as further detailed below:
1. Claims with contractors, suppliers and other claims: A number of contractors and suppliers have raised claims against the Group. These claims are either pending before courts or under arbitration and mediation proceedings. The total amount involved is Euro 389 mil. In most cases the Group has raised counter claims, which are not reflected in the accounting records, until the time of collection.
2. Fire incidents and floods: A number of individuals have raised claims against the Group for damages incurred as a result of alleged electricity-generated fires and floods. The total amount involved is Euro 46 mil.
3. Claims by employees: Employees are claiming the amount of Euro 197 mil., for allowances and other benefits that according to the employees should have been paid by PPC.
4. General Federation of PPC Personnel (GENOP DEI/KHE) and PanHellenic Federation of Retirees' (POS DEI) lawsuit against PPC GENOP DEI/KHE and POS DEI filed a lawsuit against PPC. By the above mentioned lawsuit they pursue that PPC will be obliged to pay to the insurance funds of IKA ­ ETAM and TAYTEKO (EFKA at present) the amount of Euro 634.8 mil. plus interest, for the coverage of the resource, which according to the lawsuit, the State did not pay to the above mentioned insurance funds for the years 2010 and 2011. For the above mentioned lawsuit, the decision of the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens (Nr. 164/2018) was issued in 2018 and rejects the lawsuit. According to the IJMS (Integrated Judicial Management System) no appeal has been made against this decision.
 5. PPC's lawsuit against ETAA (former TSMEDE)
ETAA (former TSMEDE) by its Decision 7/2012 has imposed on PPC the amount of Euro 27.4 mil. in application of article 4 of L. 3518/2006, as employer contributions due to the Main pension Branch for the period January 1st 2007­April 30th 2012 and pertaining to the engineers insured before January 1st 1993 to the above mentioned Insurance Fund, that have been employed by PPC for the above mentioned period.
Against the above mentioned 7/2012 decision of the Insurance Fund in question, PPC has filed legally and timely the September 5th 2012 appeal to the Athens Administrative Court of First Instance. The discussion of the appeal took place on November 11th 2014. The preliminary ruling 11872/2016 was issued, which obliges TSMEDE to produce to the Court the documents referred to the judgment and then the case will be discussed again in order to issue a final decision. Since its employees ­ who are engineers- are insured mandatorily to PPC's Insurance Fund based on L. 4491/1966, thus resulting to PPC paying on their behalf to the above mentioned Insurance Fund the corresponding employer contributions while insurance for the above mentioned engineers in ETAA is optional and is done by choice, with them paying the corresponding insurance contributions provided for engineers that are independently employed, the Parent Company considers that the possibilities of a negative outcome of its appeal are minimal and therefore has not established a provision.

6. Lawsuits of IPTO against PPC. In February 2015 IPTO filed two lawsuits against PPC, for a total amount of Euro 540 mil. for amounts due to the Parent Company's participation in the wholesale electricity market.
In particular: - By its first lawsuit IPTO is asking for an amount of Euro 242.7 mil. (with interest) for amounts due which
the Parent Company collects from supply bills and conveys to IPTO, that in turn conveys them to EMO. The interest for the above mentioned sums amounts to Euro 22 mil. - By its second lawsuit, IPTO is asking for the payment of Euro 232.6 mil. (with interest) for amounts due which the Parent Company collects from supply bills and conveys to IPTO. The interest for the above mentioned sums amounts to Euro 40 mil. The hearing of these lawsuits took place in February 28th 2019 before the Multimember Court of First Instance and its decision is pending.
The Parent Company has served an extrajudicial document inviting IPTO to pay a total amount of Euro 14 mil. The above mentioned amount corresponds to overdue interest of invoices which incorporate debts to PPC from March 2012 until the February 2nd 2015. IPTO, up to this date, has not answered to this extrajudicial document.
In December 2016, IPTO filed against PPC a new lawsuit by which IPTO asks the Parent Company to be obliged to pay an amount of Euro 406.4 mil. (with interest) for overdue receivables arising from the Company's participation in the wholesale electricity market and refer to specific non-competitive charges of IPTOs invoices. Moreover, IPTO asks the Parent Company to be obliged to pay an amount of Euro 59 mil. corresponding to interest litigation plus the relevant stamp duty. In this lawsuit, the Company submitted proposals within the given time limit and a decision is pending.
The above capital sums of the lawsuits have been paid and in any case are recorded in the Company's liabilities, so there is no reason to establish a provision. On November 29th 2018, IPTO S.A. served an extrajudicial document to PPC S.A. with which IPTO S.A. asks the Parent Company: - to repay debts of Euro 495.3 mil. from PPC's participation in the wholesale electricity market for the period
January 2018 to August 2018, which have become overdue, plus overdue interest amounting to Euro 8.8 mil. - to pay overdue interest amounting to Euro 83.4 mil, arising from the overdue payment of the Parent Company's
debts from its participation in the wholesale electricity market for the period August 2016 to September 2018.  7. Lawsuit of former EMO against PPC and counter-claims. In December 2017, EMO sent to PPC two new "Information Notes on the allocation of the monthly deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule (DAS)", totaling Euro 833 th.. With the attached letters, EMO claimed that its two new claims arose from the second settlement of the Deficit in 2011 and 2012. PPC sent the two invoices to EMO, expressly contesting the legality and methodology of calculating those retroactive charges and EMO returned them by attaching them to its letter of Nr. 301/16-1-2018. Following this, on March 5th 2018, PPC filed before Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens its lawsuit against EMO, requesting a declaration that does not owe the above-mentioned amount of Euro 833 th. and EMO to be condemned to pay an amount of Euro 50 th. as compensation due to PPC's moral damage. On March 5th 2018 EMO filed its counterclaim, asking PPC to be condemned to pay the above total amount of Euro 833 th., plus interest from January 23rd 2018. The two lawsuits will be heard together before Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens and the hearing of the two lawsuits has not yet been scheduled. The Parent Company has formed an adequate provision.
For the above amounts, the Group and the Parent Company have established provision which as of December 31th 2018 amounted to Euro 298 mil. and Euro 263 mil., respectively (2017: Group: Euro 192 mil. and Parent Company: Euro 154 mil.), which is considered adequate for the expected losses arising from the final judgment.

Alleged claims of former EMO (LAGIE), against PPC S.A. Implementation of methodology for the payments allocation due to deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule ( DAS )
Due to the deficits created by the suppliers ENERGA POWER TRADING S.A. and HELLAS POWER S.A. during 2011 and 2012, RAE's Decision 285/2013 was issued and according to this (and to Power Exchange Code for Electricity) EMO sent a letter to PPC, according to which an amount of Euro 96.6 mil. is allocated to PPC after a temporary settlement, based on the methodology by RAE regarding the fair allocation of deficits in the Day Ahead Schedule (DAS) between electricity suppliers participating in DAS.
Following the State Council's rejected decision 1761/2016, to which PPC had filed, EMO in November 2016 sent an "Information Note on the allocation of the monthly deficits of the Day Ahead Schedule ( DAS )", which allocated to PPC, after a final settlement according to Article 61 of the Power Exchange Code for Electricity, a total amount of Euro 126 mil. Subtracting the already paid amount of Euro 48.3 mil, PPC's final debt amounts to Euro 78 mil..
Following the above mentioned EMO's Information Notes, PPC's BoD with its decision 146/21.12.2016, approved the repayment of the debt as follows: an one-off payment of Euro 6.2 mil. and the payment of the residual amount of Euro 71.8 mil., in twelve (12) equal monthly interest-free installments starting from January 1st 2017. The abovementioned BoD's decision was fully implemented and within 2017 the debt was repaid.
Although EMO explicitly accepted the proposed debt settlement, on December 23rd 2016 filed a lawsuit against PPC asking approximately the amount of Euro 78 mil, plus interest, which is the residual amount that PPC owes as a registered Load Representative from the DAS settlement and from the State Council's decision 1761/2016, including also the amounts of Euro 746 th. and Euro 17 th. that PPC owes to EMO as Last Resort Supplier and as Universal Service Supplier respectively.
PPC filed on February 20th 2017 a counter lawsuit claiming EMO to be ordered to pay the amount of Euro 126 mil. as compensation for PPC's equivalent material damage and also to pay an amount of Euro 100,000.00 as compensation for PPC's moral damage. On November 9th 2017, the two above mentioned lawsuits were discussed before the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens which issued the decision 4810/2018. With this decision, on the one hand the EMO's lawsuit was accepted and on the other hand the PPC's counterclaim was rejected. An appeal against the final decision of the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens is examined by PPC.  Lawsuit of former EMO against HEDNO On June 19th 2017, HEDNO S.A. served a notice to PPC on EMO's lawsuit against HEDNO S.A. With this notice HEDNO S.A. asks PPC S.A. to intervene in favor of HEDNO S.A. in the trial in which EMO claims from HEDNO S.A. debts from invoices. In particular, EMO S.A. with its lawsuit claims amounts with interest from partially paid and unpaid invoices which incorporate receivables from the RES Special Account in the Non-Interconnected Islands (mainly debts from ETMEAR, PVs on rooftops, RES Generation in the Non-Interconnected Islands and balancing of the Special Account in the Non-Interconnected Islands). The claim from EMO's part amounts to approximately Euro 140 mil. while interest due for late payment amounts to Euro 3.9 mil. On September 11th 2017, PPC participated in this trial by submitting proposals and by adding a rebuttal to the set dates. A decision is pending.

Corrective settlements of IPTO, concerning the Special Account of art. 143, of Law 4001/2011 According to L.4152/2013, RES energy purchases in the Interconnected System are disbursed through the market operation, on the higher amount of either their income from DAS plus Imbalance settlements or the value of energy they inject to the system multiplied by the weighted average variable cost of the conventional thermal power plants. This amendment started being applied from August 14th 2013, when RAE's Decision 366/2013 was published in the OG, amending the relevant articles of the Power Exchange Code and specifying the methodology of calculations, with which the provision of the law was implemented. In October 2013, IPTO sent to PPC S.A. corrective clearing statements for May, June, July and part of August of 2013, totaling to an amount of Euro 48.2 mil., which was derived from the retrospective application of the relevant methodology. PPC's lawsuit against IPTO for the invoices in question was accepted by the Multimember Court of First Instance in Athens (Decision 2260/2016) and is considered that PPC does not have to pay the invoices issued totaling Euro 54.4 mil., which incorporate claims for the weighted average variable cost of the conventional thermal power plants for months May to August 2013. IPTO has filed an appeal but has not been formally served on PPC.
Old Bank of Crete The dispute with the old "Bank of Crete" is dating back to 1989, when the bank was under liquidation. More precisely, by a mandatory action of the then trustee of the Bank, PPC's deposits were mandatorily converted to stake-holding in the share capital of the Bank and to obligatory credit to the Bank. PPC by its July 22nd, 1991 lawsuit against the bank asked to be compensated for GRD 2.2 billion approximately, (Euro 6.5 mil.) for the reason that the above mentioned Act of the trustee of the Bank was held invalid. Moreover, PPC had outstanding loan balances, received under six (6) loan agreements for which it was agreed upon to be repaid gradually through installments. On June 10, 1991, although PPC has paid the overdue installments, the Bank has terminated all of the above mentioned loan agreements and thus on that date the claim against PPC became overdue for the whole amount of the loans. For that reason, against PPC's above mentioned lawsuit, the Bank has proposed an offset of its claim resulting by the above mentioned loans, amounting to GRD 4 bil. approximately, and furthermore has asked the payment of this amount by PPC by its lawsuit dated 28.12.1995. The Court of First Instance postponed the hearing of the Bank's lawsuit against PPC until the final outcome of the hearing, which started with PPC's lawsuit against the Bank.
PPC's lawsuit against the Bank was rejected by the Court of First Instance and PPC appealed against the said Decision of the Court which was also rejected by the Appeal Court. The above mentioned decision was brought to review by PPC before the Supreme Court, which accepted it and in consequence the case was again brought to trial before the Court of Appeals, which ordered that an expert report should take place. After the said expert report the Court's decision was held partially in PPC's favor (Court of Appeals decision 2005).However, a petition for review before the Supreme Court was filed against the aforementioned Decision which was then accepted by the Supreme Court and then was resubmitted to the Court of Appeals which by its inconclusive decision (Nr 4093/2009) ordered the completion of the expert report.
The official expert report was completed at the end of May 2012. The hearing of the case would have taken place on October 25th, 2012, but it was postponed for September 26th, 2013, due to the strike of both judges and lawyers. The case was heard on the latter date.  Decision 3680/2014 of the Athens Court of Appeals was issued, which only partially accepts PPC's lawsuit while essentially accepting the results of the ordered by the Court above mentioned official expert report, as following: a) the amount due by the Bank of Crete to PPC at the time of the filing of the lawsuit by PPC on 22.07.1991 amounted to GRD 1,268,027,987 and b) The amount due by PPC to the Bank of Crete on 01.07.1991 due to the loan amounts becoming overdue by the Bank and after the suggested by the Bank set off of its counterclaim against the above-mentioned PPC's claim, amounted to GRD 2,532,936,698.
On June 19th 2017, PPC appealed against the above mentioned decision (Decision 3680/2014 of the Court of Appeals in Athens), the hearing date of which has been scheduled for 18.03.2019. This hearing was postponed

for March 9th, 2020. It is noted that until the final judgment on the appeal, the discussion of the aforementioned (28 December 1995) lawsuit of the Bank of Crete against PPC remains suspended. In case that the Supreme Court accepts PPC's appeal for annulment, then it will judge the case anew and the decision which will issue will be irrevocable.
CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Pricing terms of "MYTILINEOS S.A. GROUP OF COMPANIES". By the October 5th, 2016 Decision of the EGM of PPC's Shareholders the customer's ALOUMINION (now MYTILINEOS S.A. GROUP OF COMPANIES) pricing terms for the period 1.7.2016 - 31.12.2020 were approved, as well as pricing for the period 1.1.2014 - 30.6.2016. Based on the Decision of the EGM, a Supply Agreement was signed on October 20th 2016 between ALOUMINION and PPC. Under the signed agreement, ALOUMINION proceeded to a prepayment of Euro 100 mil. for electricity bills for the first contractual period (July 1st 2016 to June 30th 2017), as well as on prepayment of the estimated amounts for the second and the third contractual period.
PPC's relation to its personnel's Social Security Funds Despite the fact that under the current legislation the Group does not have any obligation to cover in the future any deficit between income and expenses to PPC's personnel Social Security Funds, there can be no assurance that this regime will not change in the future.
PPC's audit by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition Since February 2017, a European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition audit of the Parent Company is in progress in accordance with Article 20 of the Regulation 1/2003 of the European Union. The audit is carried out pursuant to a relevant Commission's decision dated February 1st 2017 for alleged abuse of a dominant position on the wholesale market for the production of electricity from 2010 onwards. This audit is in progress.
ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS
Key uncertainties that may influence the final level of environmental investment which the Group will be required to undertake, over the forthcoming decade, include:
1. HPP Messochora (161.6 MW) During 2017, the Joint Ministerial Decision regarding the Environmental Terms for HPP Messochora has been issued under which PPC is obliged to perform protection projects for the preservation part of the Messochora Village (Section D). Along with the procedure for the initial expropriation of the remaining areas flooded by the Reservoir and Sectors A, B, and C of Messochora Village and the fulfillment of the obligations introduced by the new Joint Ministerial Decision, the preparation of Tender Documents for the remaining projects, is planned, with an estimated operation of the Project in 2022. On 31.12.2018 the aggregate expenditure amount for HPP Messochora amounted to Euro 281 mil., while an additional amount of Euro 67 mil. is estimated to be required in order to complete the project.
2. In December 2010, the new Directive (2010/75/ EU) was issued for industrial emissions (Industrial Emissions Directive ­ IED), revising Directives IPPC and 2001/80/ EC, which is effective from January 6th 2011. Following the provisions of Article 32 of Directive 2010/75/EU, a Transitional National Emissions Reduction Plan (TNERP) for the period 2016-2020 was elaborated and officially submitted by Greece to the EU at the end of 2012. The TNERP was approved by the EU on November 26th, 2013. On December 2013, PPC submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Energy an application for limited changes to the TNERP, along with its declaration to use the limited life-time derogation (Article 33) for certain Power Plants. After the approval from the Ministry of Environment and Energy the revised TNERP was resubmitted on March 18th , 2014 by the Greek authorities and was approved by the EU on July 7th , 2014. The Joint Ministerial Decision for TNERP was issued in

248

August 2015 (Nr. 34062/957/103/2015). Finally, according to the above, SES Agios Dimitrios, as well as the disinvested Units of Meliti and Megalopolis 3 and 4 are included in the TNERP, while SES Amyntaion and Kardia will use the limited life-time derogation.
3. In 2011 began the process of revising the Reference Document on Best Available Techniques Manual for Large Combustion Plants within the framework of Directive 2010/75/EU, and is coordinated by the EIPPCB (European IPPC Bureau). With the European Commission's decision 2017/1442 on 31.07.2017, the Conclusions on Best Available Techniques for Large Combustion Plants ­ BREF LCP were determined under Directive 2010/75/EU. The Decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on August 17th 2017. Following the adoption, of the legally binding, conclusions of the revised Manual, additional investments in PPC's major thermal stations may be required.
4. On November 28th 2015 Directive 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and the Council's of November 25th 2015 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from Medium Combustion Units, regardless of the type of fuel used. As Medium Combustion Units, are defined units with a rated thermal input equal to or greater than 1 MWth and less than 50 MWth. Pollutants in question are sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust, while rules for the monitoring of emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) are defined. Production units of such a size, operate mainly in the islands (engines and turbines). Also, in many of PPC's SES, there are many G/S and auxiliary boilers, but with limited operating time.
The provisions of the new Directive should be thoroughly examined by the competent departments of PPC, so as together with the competent Greek authorities to timely promote the appropriate strategies for the electrification of the islands with technically and economically viable solutions which should also be promptly implemented, and in any case before the expiry of the deadline laid down by the Directive. Indicatively, major projects such as the islands' interconnection, should be planned and implemented in such a way as to fully cover the needs of all islands in electricity, while any remaining production units will be used as a backup solution and will be operating only in an emergency, not exceeding 500 hours of operation per year.
5. The extent of land contamination has to be assessed for many of PPC's installations, following the provisions of art. 22 of Directive 2010/75/EU. At present, there appears to be no requirement for remediation projects at PPC's sites for the foreseeable future, and it is unlikely that this will be required at the mining areas or at the lignite-fired power stations. Remediation, however, may be required, at some of the company's oil-fired power stations in the future. In the context of the decommissioning of the Unit Agios Georgios in Keratsini, a remediation study for the land and the underground water in the Unit was submitted in November 2016 and was approved by the Competent Authorities on July 2017. The remediation cost is estimated at Euro 213.
 6. PPC has performed limited studies on the presence of asbestos-containing materials, at its premises. Upon
submission by PPC of a full environmental impact assessment study, the Ministry of Environment issued in May 2004 the environmental permit for the construction and operation by PPC, in its premises in Ptolemaida area of an environmentally ­ controlled Industrial Waste Management Area for the management and final disposal of asbestos containing construction materials, from the plants of the Northern System. With the real estate transfer contract no. 37244 / 05.06.2015, which is legally transcribed, PPC transferred full ownership of the Industrial Waste Management Area, located at the Kardia Mine of the Western Macedonia Lignite Center, in DIADYMA S.A. From the date of signing the contract, DIADYMA S.A. is responsible for the Area's management.
7. In April 2018 the Environmental Terms for Klidi and Megalopolis Mines were issued. In the context of the divestment of the assets of PPC SA, Klidi Mine and Megalopolis Mine were included in the assets contributed by PPC S.A. to the two new companies LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A. and LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A.. (See Notes 2 & 4)

8. The Environmental Terms for Amyntaio Mine are expected to be issued.
9. During March and May 2013, CO emission licenses have been issued for the then 31 PPC installations, for the 3rd implementation phase of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS phase III, from January 1st 2013 to December 31st 2020). On November 2015 the license of the Lignite Centre of Western Macedonia thermal station was revoked due to its decommissioning. On May 2017 the licenses of Ptolemaida and Agios Georgios thermal stations were revoked due to their decommissioning. On February 2018 the CO emission license of the Power Plant in South Rhodes was issued. Following the establishment of subsidiaries LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A. and LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A. in the context of the divestment, SES Meliti belongs now to LIGNITIKI MELITIS S.A. SES Megalopolis A belongs to LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A. while SES Megalopolis B was separated in SES Megalopolis Unit IV, belonging to LIGNITIKI MEGALOPOLIS S.A. and in SES Megalopolis Unit V, belonging to the Parent Company PPC S.A. As a result of these modifications, PPC's bound installations (including the aforementioned installations of subsidiaries) amount to thirty (30). On 31.03.2018, the verification of the annual emissions reports of the then 28 bound plants of PPC for 2017 by accredited third party verifiers was completed and the reports were promptly submitted to the Competent Authority, according to the current legislation. The total verified emissions for 2017 amounted to 31.74 mil. tones CO.
INVESTMENTS
A new Steam Electric unit 660 MW in Ptolemaida The construction of the new Steam Electric unit 660 MW in Ptolemaida is in progress. PPC has already paid the two advance payments of Euro 197.88 mil. each against relevant Letters of Guarantee of Advance Payment amounting to Euro 226.77 mil. each. On December 31th 2018 the total expenditure for the Project amounts to Euro 1.047 mil.
A new diesel engine Power Plant 115,4W in South Rhodos burning of heavy fuel oil with low sulphur content The construction of the new diesel engine Power Plant 115,4W in South Rhodos burning of heavy fuel oil with low sulphur content is in the stage of completion and all Units have been put into Commercial Operation. On December 31th 2018 the total expenditure for the project amounts to Euro 198 mil.
 new combined cycle unit at Megalopolis 811W The Unit was put into commercial operation in January 2016. Performance tests of the Unit have already been executed and the evaluation report for the said tests was submitted. Moreover, the compliance tests of the Unit with the Management Code of the Greek Transmission System were completed. The Unit's Temporary Acceptance Procedure has been completed, and the Final Acceptance Procedure is in progress. On December 31th 2018 the total expenditure for the Project amounted to Euro 517 mil.  Hybrid Project in Ikaria The Hybrid Project in Ikaria of 6.85 MW total capacity combines the utilization of two renewable energy sources, Wind and Hydroelectric. The project started in 2009 and has been completed to a percentage over 95%. The completion of the project delayed due to contractual dissents with the contractor. In 2018, at the request of the contractor the two parties proceeded to a "friendly settlement procedure", the outcome of which was accepted by both parties and the new project completion timetable was agreed. During November 2018, the Wind Park was put into trial operation, the tests were completed and the Semi-Commercial operation of the project was started. The entire project is expected to be completed, connected to HEDNO's electricity network and operates "manually" in early 2019. The automated operation of the Project is expected to be completed in June 2019.

40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Fair value and fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuing technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
During the reporting period there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurement, and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurement.
The following tables compare the carrying amount of the Group's and the Company's financial instruments that are carried at amortized cost and their fair value, as well as those of tangible fixed assets which are revalued periodically at their revalued amounts:

Macroeconomic conditions in Greece The Group's and the Parent Company's results of operations, financial condition and prospects depend highly on the macroeconomic and microeconomic environment in Greece, as almost all of their assets and activities are in Greece. Any adverse change and development in the macro and micro-economic environment of the country which directly and materially affects customer's demand for electricity, customer's ability to repay their debts, company's ability to pass in its tariffs increases in its costs, or funding opportunities from the domestic financial system, consequently affects the Group's and the Parent Company's operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

Financial Risk Management
Fair Value
The amounts reflected in the accompanying balance sheets for cash, current assets and current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term maturity.
The fair value of investments available for sale that are traded on stock markets are based on their quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The carrying values of long-term borrowings approximate their fair value because these loans are in local currency and mainly of floating interest rate. For all derivatives, the fair values are confirmed by the financial institutions with which the Group has concluded the relative contracts.
Credit Risk Despite the fact that, electricity sales are dispersed over a large number of customers with a wide and diversified range of operations (dispersing the credit risk), the Group's and the Parent Company's business activities, results of operations and cash flows are highly dependent on their customers' ability to repay their obligations. The current economic environment and the recent intense recession had a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity, mainly resulting from:
· Difficulties in payments by customers who still do not repay their obligations. · A sizeable number of enterprises, especially small and medium sized which cease their operations due to the
economic conjecture and leave behind unpaid bills. · The prospective increase of the Social Solidarity Tariff (SRT) beneficiaries due to the prolonged economic
crisis, along with the increased difficulty that these customers face in paying their electricity bills. · The lack of the ability (following RAE's decision) to transfer debts of the same customer between its various
electricity bills for household use, which accounts for the 70% of the customers. · New incidents where customers (both household and commercial) with debts due to electricity consumption
or electricity theft, attempt to change their electricity supplier under a different name (or a different Tax Identification Number) in order to avoid restrictions that the Electricity Code imposes. · The fact that some customers under the pretext of the current economic downturn are not fulfilling their obligations or delay their payments, despite the fact that they afford to do so. · Some (Medium and High Voltage) industrial customers do not pay their electricity bills in full, alleging mainly lack of liquidity due to the adverse economic environment. · In addition, some of these industrial customers do not accept some of competitive charges of the HV tariffs. For customers of these categories it cannot be certain that they will repay the invoiced amounts related to electricity consumption.  It is noted that the Parent Company's collection enforcement mechanisms may be affected by legislation or other administrative acts, (for example by restricting disconnections for non-payment of electricity bills for certain categories of customers or in areas that are declared to be in an emergency state, where customers benefiting from such decisions stop paying their bills).
In December 2017, following a tender, the project for the management of debts was assigned to a specialized House. The project is in full progress with satisfactory results. A plan of actions to be implemented with escalation, consistency and continuity has been proposed, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the actions to reduce outstanding bills. However, the risk persists due to the financial difficulty of part of the customers for timely repayment of their obligations, and finally will adversely affect the Parent Company's business activities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk The Group's and the Parent Company's debt obligations consist of bank loans, bonds and overdrafts. It is the Group's and the Parent Company's policy to have a balanced distribution of the loan portfolio between fixed and floating interest rates according to the prevailing conditions and to hedge on a case by case basis through derivatives, solely to mitigate risk, against the fluctuation of floating interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates affecting their debt portfolio. As of December 31st 2018 no derivative transactions exist for loans or debt hedging.
Furthermore, the fluctuation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar exchange rate may adversely impact the prices of the Parent Company's liquid fuel purchases (diesel and heavy fuel oil). As oil prices are expressed in U.S. dollars, the Parent Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the event of an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from liquid fuel purchases, the Parent Company examines the possibility of undertaking, on a case by case basis and according to the prevailing market liquidity circumstances, hedging transactions for this risk. It should be noted that any undertaken hedging transactions may not provide full or adequate protection against these risks.

Liquidity Risk The macroeconomic and financial environment in Greece remains volatile, and this may have a considerable adverse effect on the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position and prospects. In addition, access to foreign financial markets is affected. Liquidity risk is connected with the need to ensure adequate cash flows for the financing of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, as well as the servicing of the Group's and the Parent Company's debt.
The Group's and the Parent Company's working capital needs may increase due to a number of factors, including:
· The increased delays in the payment or even non-payment of electricity bills in particular from those customers with interruption of a supply contract.
· The obligation to pay Renewables levy (ETMEAR), Special Consumption Tax on electricity as well as VAT when due, irrespective of whether relevant amounts have been collected or not.
· The burden associated with the collection of taxes and levies that are not related to the sale of electricity, such as municipal taxes and levies that are currently collected through electricity bills and the inability to pay for the electricity consumption amounts without paying in the same time amounts due to third parties.
· The continuous increase in the number of citizens included in the register of vulnerable customers that based on decisions of the State enjoy special privileges regarding (a) a longer period for paying their bills (40 days from the date of issue). b) the settlement of their debts in many installments and free of interest, c) limited penalties in the case of non-payment of bills and installments, since the supply of electricity cannot be disconnected due to debt, in their residence, almost throughout the year.
· Regulatory decisions on the operation of the wholesale market, which burden the cost of purchasing electricity for PPC as an electricity Supplier.
· The potential increase of commercial losses (non-technical losses), due to the non-suppression of incidents of electricity theft and arbitrary reconnection of electricity supply in cases of electricity disconnection due to debt.

part ' / Financial Report

The above factors may have a material adverse impact on the Group's and the Parent Company's liquidity as well as their ability to finance new or ongoing projects. It should also be noted that the Group's and the Parent Company's borrowing costs for accessing and finding liquidity (for refinancing existing debt and/or new liquidity) on both domestic and international level are affected by the state of the Greek economy in recent years.
The contractual maturities of the principal financial liabilities (borrowings), not including interest payments are as follows:

Risk from exposure to the Banking Sector The Group and the Parent Company may be exposed to risks arising for the Greek banking sector (for example limitations effected by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) of the ECB on loans for Public Entities). It should be noted that as of 31.12.2018 the Parent Company's debt obligations towards the Greek Banking sector amounted to 34.1% of their total loan obligations.
Market risk The sensitivity analysis on liquid fuel, natural gas, liquid fuel, CO and system marginal price are as follow:

Heavy fuel oil (tones)

Diesel (klit)

Natural Gas (m3)

+0.01

Change in price unit

The change in the $/ rate by 5 cents of the dollar is estimated to affect the expenditure for liquid fuels and natural gas as well as profit before tax for the year 2019 by Euro 26 mil. In 2019, the annual CO emissions are estimated at 22.8 mil. t. (15.9 mil. t from lignite, 3 mil. t. from Natural Gas, 3.9 mil. t. from liquid fuels) with an average price Euro 21.3/t.
The purchased allowances amount to 8.5 mil. t with an average price of Euro 19.7/t. Therefore, the change in the purchase price of new CO emission allowances by +/- Euro 1.0/t changes the relative expenditure by approximately Euro 14.3 mil.

At the balance sheet date (31.12.2018), the Group's outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are approximately the current year's lease expenses, which are expected not to be significantly altered during the next years. Operating lease payments represent mainly rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties, machinery, land, vehicles and furniture and equipment. Lease fees for office properties are generally fixed for an average term of twelve years. Lease fees for machinery and vehicles are generally fixed for an average of 1 and 3 year, respectively.
42. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
LARCO Tariffs On 21.06.2017, the Electricity Supply Contracts and Pledged Receivables between PPC S.A. and LARCO S.A. were signed.
Due to non-compliance with contractual obligations of the above-mentioned Contracts on the part of LARCO, PPC, in order to defend its interests, has already proceeded with the actions provided for by the contracts and the regulatory framework. In particular:
· Due to inadequate compliance with the terms of the Pledged Contract on LARCO's bank account, PPC sent in February 2018 a relevant extrajudicial letter, immediately exercising all the rights of the pledge.
· Due to inadequate compliance with the terms of the Electricity Supply Contract, PPC sent in April 2018 an extrajudicial document to LARCO and the Members of its Board of Directors, with a 30-day margin for the payment by LARCO of its direct ­ in accordance with the contractual terms-overdue debts amounting to Euro 50 mil. In May 2018, Euro 15 mil. was credited by LARCO against the debts concerned.
· Due to breach of the essential terms of the Supply Contract and in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Code, PPC sent in October 2018 a relevant extrajudicial document and protest, with a 30-day margin for the payment by LARCO of its direct ­ in accordance with the contractual terms - overdue debts amounting to Euro 69 mil., otherwise PPC would proceed to the deactivation of a load meter towards IPTO S.A.
· Due to the fact that LARCO did not meet its above mentioned obligations, by depositing in October 2018 only the amount of Euro 3 mil. against its direct overdue debts, PPC proceeded in November 2018, as provided for in the Contract and the Electricity Code, to an order for the deactivation of a load meter towards IPTO S.A., giving a 10-day deadline to LARCO for the repayment of its direct debts amounting to Euro 72.5 mil.
· As the new deadline to LARCO expired inactively, PPC, taking into account the provisions of the Electricity Code and the contractual terms, on 27.11.2018 sent to LARCO and IPTO S.A. an extrajudicial document with termination of contract and declaration of the deactivation of LARCO's load meter, without prejudice to any of PPC's rights arising from the legislation and relating to the lawful fulfillment of its legal and overdue receivables against LARCO.
Following this, LARCO filed an application for interim measures requesting a temporary injunction against PPC and IPTO for non-disconnection of the electricity supply of its facilities. Following the hearing of this application, on December 7th 2018, a decision was taken by which the President of the Single-Member Court of First Instance in Athens rejected the above mentioned LARCO's application since it was not possible that the application for interim measures would have a positive outcome, the hearing of which was determined on 06/02/2019.

Subsequently, following the statements of the Minister of Environment and Energy, as published in the press release of the Ministry on 12.12.18, attempting to resolve the issue, moving in three axes: firstly, the procedures for the signing of a new contract between PPC and LARCO should proceed, secondly, LARCO should adjust production levels to lower levels required by low nickel prices, transfer additional cash to PPC and rationalize the payroll cost and thirdly, PPC should accept the consequences of the cessation of the representation to be postponed to the start of the new year. On 13.12.2018, PPC with its extrajudicial letter to LARCO and IPTO suspended the consequences of the deactivation of LARCO's load meters and the termination of the LARCO's Contract in order to find a solution. However, PPC with the above mentioned extrajudicial letter, made absolutely clear, that prerequisites for the signing of a new Electricity Supply Contract were a) the creation of the conditions and the establishment of special clauses so that LARCO can pay PPC for the electricity consumed fully and timely and b) the preparation of a plan for the repayment of LARCO's debts to PPC and its immediate implementation, starting with the debts accumulated under the contract of 21.06.2017.
Following the aforementioned PPC's extrajudicial statement and the related LARCO's letter to begin negotiations by the Parties for finding mutually acceptable settlement for LARCO's debts to PPC and after strenuous negotiations, the parties jointly agreed on a framework agreement, which meets the prerequisites set by PPC so as to allow the parties to proceed in a relevant supply contract for the period from 11.1.2019 to 31.12.2020. The framework agreement was approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and the procedures for the signing of Electricity Supply Contract are in progress. This framework agreement is currently being implemented, the terms of which have been agreed by the parties as essential and any breach of even one of them by LARCO, constitutes reason for immediate termination of the contractual relationship by PPC.
It is noted that as of 31.12.2018, a provision has been formed for all PPC's receivables from LARCO, amounting to Euro 309.8 mil.
Commercial policy and Management of overdue debts In 2018, PPC, in order to manage the problem of overdue debts, proceeded to the following: · Revision of the Debt Settlements Regulation as of 01.05.2018 in order to provide personalized settlements,
depending on customer's behavior and the number of outstanding bills, so as to limit the creation of new doubtful receivables. · PPC, since December 2017, has been cooperating with a specialized support service company in terms of more efficient management of PPC's customer base, with emphasis on overdue debts. The company proposes new strategies for the management of overdue debts and has designed the framework for their implementation. As of March 2018 the management of a selected customer segment with overdue debts from debtor information companies and law firms began and since June 2018 the actions have been systemized. · The actions in PPC's Sales Stores for the collection of debts (telephone notifications to debtors, sending letters of formal notice through the PPC's Legal Department etc.) have been intensified. · PPC continued throughout the year 2018 and until 31.3.2019 to provide a 15% discount to residential and business customers. Since 1.4.2019, all customers who pay full their estimated and actual bills until payment due date, they receive a refund (credit) on their next bill, 10% of the value of the electricity consumption in previous actual bill. Respectively the discount due to the prepayment of the electricity bill was set to 4% since 1.4.2019. · Customer registration efforts to e-bill are intensified and in addition, these customers are given the option of choosing an electronic "Monthly Billing". This improves the time and quality of customer service, saving human and financial resources and substantially enhances the environmental footprint. Since 1.12.2018, as a disincentive it was decided that all printed bills should be charged with Euro 1, about as much as the cost of their issuing and sending them. · It was also decided as an incentive, to reduce the value of the bill by one Euro for those customers who do not wish to receive printed their bills.

Other High Voltage Tariffs In view of the expected developments in the electricity market, and especially the divestment of 40% of PPC's lignite generation capacity, combined with the forthcoming change in the energy market model, the establishment of a long-term tariff policy by PPC in 2017 was not possible. However, given the fact that the supply contracts with the High Voltage customers for the energy consumed in the period 2016-2017 expired on 31.12.17, PPC, in December 2017, sent letters to all High Voltage customers, with a proposal to extend the existing Supply Contract for the period 2016 - 2017, until 28.02.2018, in the framework of the Electricity Code and contractual relationships. Subsequently, PPC's Board of Directors, by its related decision, approved the extension of the High Voltage Tariffs until 28.2.2019 and on 26.6.18 PPC's EGM approved the extension of the discounts, which were approved by EGM's decision on 7.12.2015, until 28.2.2019. In this context, a new round of meetings with High Voltage customers was held to inform them on the above issues. Out of the total of 91 supplies that electrify installations of 58 High Voltage customers, electricity supply contracts relating to 72 supplies of 48 High Voltage customers were signed, while for one customer with one supply, namely HALYVOURGIKI SA, a cessation of the representation has taken place on 17.12.2018 due to debts.
The course of implementation of the structural changes that have been launched to strengthen competition in the electricity and natural gas markets continues to be a critical parameter for PPC. Furthermore, PPC's lignite generation capacity divestment is estimated to be implemented in May 2019 and will be completed in 2019. Under the prevailing circumstances, the establishment of a long-term tariff policy for High Voltage customers was not possible, while it is estimated that such a possibility will exist after the removal of uncertainties and the implementation of the new energy market model and at least not before the end of 2019. In this context, PPC's BoD, with its decision no. 34/19.3.2019 approved the submission of proposals to High Voltage customers (except MYTILINEOS S.A.-GROUP OF COMPANIES and LARCO S.A.) for the adjustment of the existing tariffs by + 10%, in order to be signed supply contracts for the period 1.3.2019 - 31.12.2020. Already, on 4.4.2019, an agreement to sign a supply contract with the companies of VIOHALKO Group in High Voltage has been reached.
PPC's claims from HALYVOURGIKI S.A. · PPC filed an application for a payment order before the Court of First Instance in Athens against the company
under the name "HALYVOURGIKI S.A.", in which PPC claimed from HALYVOURGIKI to pay the total amount of Euro 30,473,320.80 plus interest from the day following the expiry of the final bill issued after the termination of the Electricity Supply Contract between PPC S.A. and HALYVOURGIKI S.A. and until repayment, plus the amount of Euro 15,237 for court costs. The payment order No. 1769/2019 of the Single-Member Court of First Instance in Athens was issued which orders "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." to pay to PPC the above total amount. PPC notified the payment order in question to "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." and further, on 15.3.2019 proceeded to serve the writ of garnishment for conservative seizure in the banks under the above payment order against "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." Subsequently, on 22.3.2019, an application for suspension of "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." against PPC S.A. was served to PPC, following a request for a temporary injunction, the hearing of which took place on 26.03.2019. Following the discussion of the case, the application in question was rejected by the competent President of the Court of First Instance in Athens. PPC, upon expiry of the deadline of the statements of a third party on behalf of the banks to whom proceeded to conservative seizure, at the request of "HALYVOURGIKI S.A.", proceeded to the bank EUROBANK in a partial withdrawal of imposed conservative seizure up to the amount corresponding to the payroll cost of that company's employees. · Furthermore, on 15.2.2019, "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." filed against PPC an appeal for arbitration before the ICC (INTERNATIONAL COURT OF ARBITRATION) "due to PPC's failure to comply with the obligations under the Shareholders Agreement of 2009" between PPC S.A. and "HALYVOURGIKI S.A.", requesting PPC to be condemned to pay the amount of two hundred and seventy million (270,000,000) for consequential damage, which according to the appeal in question, "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." suffered with interest from the service of this appeal, plus one million (1,000,000) Euro for moral damage which according to "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." suffered. Both "HALYVOURGIKI S.A." and PPC S.A. appointed their arbitrators (each party appointed its arbitrator). Deadline for PPC's reply in order to define the group of its legal representatives as well as to collect the data needed to defend its positions, was set by the ICC on April 25th, 2019.

VAT refund By submitting the VAT declaration 06/2018, a request for VAT refund of Euro 100 mil. was submitted, from the credit balance of the tax period 01/12/2016 to 30/06/2018. Moreover, by submitting the VAT declaration 09/2018, a request for VAT refund of Euro 80 mil. was submitted, from the credit balance of the tax period 01/07/2018 to 30/09/2018. The above credit balances were derived mainly from outflows subject to a rate lower than the input tax. Following a partial temporary audit from Athens Tax Office for Commercial Companies, the above amounts were returned to the Company mainly by offsetting the Income Tax for the year 2017 and the other withholding taxes.
Merger by absorption of the 100% subsidiary PPC Renewables S.A. In November 2018, the Parent Company's Board of Directors approved: a) the commencement of the merger procedure, through absorption by the Parent Company of its 100% subsidiary PPC Renewables S.A., according to Codified Law 2190/1920, in conjunction with the Law 2166/1993 and the P.D. 178/2002, as currently in force, b) the authorization of the Chief Executive Officer to take any necessary relevant Decision, c) the determination of the Transformation Balance Sheet Date, on 31.12.2018 and d) the approval of the operational integration, immediately after the absorption, of the activities of PPC Renewables S.A. in the corresponding structures of the Parent Company.

NOTES TO THE UNBUNDLED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
According to the provisions of European Directive 2009/72/EC, as well as the provisions of Law 4001/2011, which integrates the aforementioned European Directive into the national legislation, unbundling is the separation of financial statements (balance sheet and income statement) of an integrated electric utility into different financial statements for each one of its activities. The unbundled financial statements will reflect each activity's financial position, assets and liabilities, as if such activities prepared financial statements had they been separate (independent) legal entities.
PPC, as a vertically organized integrated electric utility, keeps in its internal accounting, separate accounts for its activities and prepares separate balance sheets and statements of income for each one of its activities (balance sheet and statement of income before tax­hereinafter referred to as "unbundled financial statements"), as if these activities were carried out by different entities, in order to avoid discriminations, cross subsidization and distortion of competition.
Further to the above, PPC should keep separate accounts for its activities carried out in the non-interconnected islands.
The accounting principles applied for the preparation of the unbundled financial statements are those applied for the preparation of the Company's separate and consolidated financial statements.
The unbundling methodology applied by the Company for the preparation of the accompanied unbundled financial statements was approved by the 266/2014 Decision of the Regulatory Authority for Energy. Additionally, in the Non ­ Interconnected System the transactions of energy between PPC's Generation and Supply and HEDNO, are carried out according to RAE's Decision 641/2013.
It is noted that as of 15/6/2017, IPTO does not belong to the Group's subsidiaries and follows the model of ownership unbundled Operator, fully harmonized with the Directive 2009/72/EC. As a result, information disclosures by operational segment as well as the principles of segment as presented in IFRS 8 "Operating Segment" are stated and refer only to continuing operations of the Company.
2. ACCOUNTING UNBUNDLING METHODOLOGY
The methodology applied for the preparation of the unbundled financial statements consists of the following phases: a) Determination of activities into which the integrated electric utility should be unbundled, b) Preparation of unbundled trial balances, c) Preparation of unbundled balance sheets, d) Preparation of the unbundled statements of income, e) Quantification of inter-segment revenues and expenses among activities through the application of an
internal pricing system
Determination of activities into which the integrated electric utility should be unbundled
The activities for unbundled financial statements are prepared, on a first level, are Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply, and Corporate.

On a second level, these activities are presented as follows: · Interconnected System
· Mines · Generation · Distribution network · Supply · System of Crete · Generation · Distribution network · Supply · System of other Non-Interconnected Islands · Generation · Distribution network · Supply
Mines Mines include the lignite extraction activity carried out in the Lignite Centers of West Macedonia and Megalopolis.
Generation Generation includes the electricity generation activities in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non-Interconnected Islands.
Distribution Distribution Network includes the rental of assets to HEDNO SA in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non Interconnected Islands.
Supply Supply reflects the Company's activity which monitors relationships with final customers in the Interconnected System, the System of Crete and the System of Non-Interconnected Islands.
Corporate The Corporate is the administrative departments of the Parent Company, which provide support to PPC's activities. The Balance Sheet and Statement of Income of the Corporate is further allocated based on certain allocation rules, which are described in detail in the following pages. Related parties are reflected as a separate activity in the group unbundled financial statements.
Preparation of unbundled trial balances In the Company's accounting system, each the cost centre and the profit centre represents an organizational entity, in which the assets and liabilities are recorded. In order for these trial balances to be generated, the following tasks are performed, which are applied per account and cost / profit centre for the minimum account degree in General Accounting:
· Cost / profit centers are recorded in order to identify the boundaries of activities and then all cost / profit centers to be assigned to activities with which they are related to.
· The sum totals of the cost / profit centers and accounts are reconciled with the comprehensive trial balance of the Company.

part ' / Financial Report

288

· The trial balance accounts are codified and grouped into sections of the balance sheet and of the income statement based on Company's consolidated Financial Statements.
Preparation of unbundled balance sheets
At the end of each financial year, balance sheets are prepared for each of the four activities (Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply) in the Interconnected System, in the Crete System and in the Non ­ Interconnected Islands System.
The balance sheet for each activity is prepared under the principle of independent accounting.
The accounts of each balance sheet are as follows: i. Direct, which include the direct charges and credits of the accounts of the relevant profit centers of the corresponding level of activity, ii. Indirect of the administration departments, which derive from the administration departments of each activity and include its allocated balance sheet accounts. iii. Indirect of the Corporate, which include the allocated balance sheet accounts, which are presented in a separate line on each activity's balance sheet.
In addition, in the accounts of balance sheets there are profitable Activities where funding other Activities for their needs in cash equivalents. The presentation of these transactions reflected in separately lines in the accounts of balance sheet in current assets and current liabilities.
Additionally, the Balance Sheets of PPC's subsidiaries are depicted separately.
Preparation of the unbundled statements of income
For each accounting period income statements are prepared for each of the four activities (Mines, Generation, Distribution Network, Supply) in the Interconnected System, in the Crete System and in the Non ­ Interconnected Islands System. Additionally, the Income Statements of PPC's subsidiaries are depicted separately.
Income statement accounts of financial nature are allocated to activities based on the loans of each activity.
Then, income statement account balances that have remained in Corporate are allocated in the activities. For the allocation of revenues and expenses to Activities the criterion is based on direct expenses of every Activity, with the exception of expenses that relate to the system of customers' monitoring and billing that are assigned only to Supply. Upon completion of the above allocations, the Statements of income for each Activity are prepared. The Corporate expenses and revenues allocated to the activities are presented separately in a line item in each activity.
Quantification of inter-segment revenues and expenses among activities through the application of an internal pricing system
Within the framework of an integrated utility products and services are exchanged among its activities, which would be recorded if these activities would operate as independent entities.

In order for these products and services to be quantified and recorded, an internal pricing system is applied if necessary (where there is no external determination of internal exchanges). The most important services and products internally exchanged in PPC among its Activities, that are presented in the Unbundled Financial Statements are the following:

Product / Service

Interconnected system

Lignite

Other Services 

Self-consumption energy

System of Crete

Self-consumption energy

System of other non-interconnected islands

Self-consumption Energy



Renders
Mines Mines Supply
Supply
Supply

Activity which

Receives

Generation Generation Mines, Generation

Mines, Generation

Generation

Each activity's revenues from product sales or services to another activity are quantified, through the internal pricing system. Also, the activity that receives the product/ service records the related cost.
The internal revenues ­ expenses for each activity are defined as follows:
In the interconnected system:
· The internal energy sales for self-consumption are calculated based on each Activity's metered consumption of energy with the average marginal price including the Return of receivable Public Service Obligations, Transmission System Tariffs and IPTO uplift charge.
· The Mines internal revenue is calculated in accordance of the agreement for the lignite supply between Mines and Generation. The lignite supply contract determines the internal lignite market, i.e the lignite sales of the activity of the Lignite General Division to the activity of the Generation General Division. The contract covers the consumption of the lignite stations on a continuous basis, as well as with the necessary stock for the specific period. The calculation of the relative amounts takes place on the monthly basis, taking into account the monthly consumption and the calorific value of the lignite delivered.
In the Non-Interconnected system:
· The internal energy sales are calculated based on each activity's metered consumption of energy priced by the average revenue of PPC's tariffs for the sale of electricity to Medium Voltage for Industrial Use customers.
