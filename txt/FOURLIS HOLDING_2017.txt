7. Information about Group's plan of development
According to the temporary data of the Hellenic Statistical Authority of 5/3/2018 the GDP in terms of volume, the 4th quarter of 2017 increased by 1,9% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2016. This fact leads to the estimation that the year 2017 in terms of volume will increase by 1,4% compared to 2016, while for the year 2018 Greek Economy is expected to grow slightly above 2%, based on I.O.B.E. (Foundation for Economic & Industrial Research).
With the expectation that the year 2018 in Greece, despite the existing pressure in economy and especially in retail trading due to the: · high taxation of natural persons and legal entities, · cumulative debt of households and companies, · ongoing high unemployement despite its gradual de-escalation, · existing restrictions on capital movement, · limited possibility of banking system to dispose capitals for new investments,
but also from the fact that the risk of a new recession cycle has been decreased but not yet fully eliminated, the Management of the Group aims to:
a) increase its profitability at which it has already returned since the year 2015, b) continue strictly chosen investments, especially in the segment of retail trading of sporting goods where investing
opportunities exist and can be implemented with the current funding abilities, c) gain benefits from synergies and scale economies that have been achieved within the Group with the completion of
warehouse and distribution services supply towards all companies of the Group by the company TRADE LOGISTICS SA, d) investigate for new investment opportunities in activity areas ­ such as the management of retail stores ­ that the Group is well aware of and has positive results, e) maintain the balance of the income source of the Group between domestic and foreign companies for the rational allocation of risk at the different countries of activity.
Management of the Group estimates that the year 2018 will be crucial regarding the implementation of the measures which is a necessary precondition in order to attract investments and create a consistent base for the expected growth path.
Fiscal stability, gradual restoration of confidence in Banking system and de-escalation of unemployement despite its high rate contribute to the creation of positive perspective for the year 2018.
Taking into consideration all the aforementioned, the Management will proceed to the implementation of its business plan with selective investments in Greece and foreign countries where the Group operates, as follows:
In the retail trading of sporting goods segment, with a network at the end of the year 2017 of one hundred and fourteen (114) stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Turkey as well as two (2) e-commerce Stores in Greece and Romania, within the year 2018 seven (7) new INTERSPORT Stores are expected to be added to the existing network and the e-commerce store in Cyprus is expected to start operating. Moreover, two (2) new TAF stores are expected to be added to the fourteen (14) already operating stores. At the end of 2018, the retail trading of sporting goods segment is expected to have a netwotk of one hundred and twenty-one (121) INTERSPORT Stores and sixteen (16) TAF Stores as well as ecommerce Stores in Greece, Romania and Cyprus will be fully operating.
The home furniture and household goods segment, which operates seven (7) IKEA Stores, seven (7) Pick up & Order Points and three (3) e-commerce Stores Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus, will examine new selective investments in Pick up & Order Points and will proceed to an upgrade of its software for better customer service.

d) Work related matters

Employment Corporate policies and due diligence The FOURLIS Group is its People, all those who support its operations on a daily basis. Our approach to employment and our relations with our employees directly affect their performance, retention and development, while these issues are also significant for the long term sustainability of our Group.

Our Policy's main pillars, related to employee recruitment and professional development of our Human Resources, are: · Common recruitment evaluation criteria for all of the Group's companies, to ensure equal opportunities and to avoid
discrimination. · Provision of equal development opportunities through internal transfer and promotion processes to all employees of
the Group. · Taking into consideration the balance between the two genders in the selection and development processes of our
employees, as well as in the compensation and benefits policies.

When any of our companies require new job openings, those are readily covered either by an internal transfer/promotion of employees (through the Open Resourcing process), or by a direct transfer/promotion of an employee (for Executives), or by a new recruitment.

It is also worth mentioning, that in the FOURLIS Group companies, and in all countries where the Group operates, people of 36 ethnicities are employed.

Outcome of these policies and non-financial key performance indicators In 2017, the Group's total number of employees was 3.897 out of which 2.751 work in Greece and Cyprus.

Also, since 2008, we have adopted a single annual Performance Appraisal and Development Review Process for all Group employees to ensure that their appraisal process is and will remain transparent.
Employee training and education Corporate policies and due diligence At the FOURLIS Group we believe that the employees' need for training is continuous and increasing, as the competition and the current market demands are constantly generating new training and education needs. For this reason, the training of each Group's employee begins upon his/her recruitment.
Outcome of these policies and non-financial key performance indicators The first training program for every Group employee is an induction program, through which we make sure that all the newly

Annual Financial Report 41

hired employees are informed about the Group's Structure, Values, Code of Conduct and Internal Regulation Charter of each company.
In addition, in 2011 the FOURLIS "Learning Academy" was established in which all of the FOURLIS Group employees are members, participating in programs depending on their role and their needs for personal development.
In the context of the Academy, the FOURLIS Retail MBA program was launched in 2016. The program was designed and created in 2015 under the auspices of the Athens University of Economics and Business and the Hellenic Retail Business Association (HRBA) with the main objective to provide high level knowledge from University Professors and Senior Executives of both the Market and the FOURLIS Group, in a range of fields mainly focusing on Retail Management. Employees from all the FOURLIS Group companies and from all countries in which it operates participate in the program.
Employee health, safety and wellbeing Corporate policies and due diligence Acknowledging that the creation of a safe and healthy work environment is our obligation, at the FOURLIS Group we follow the clauses of the legislation on labor law in all countries where we operate, and also attend to the assessment of possible risks we may face in the coming year and take the necessary measures to prevent potential accidents.
An important priority for us is to safeguard compliance with the Health & Safety Policy by having safety technicians conduct intensive inspections, throughout the Group companies' facilities, and draw up a specific appraisal report on occupational risk. At the FOURLIS Group, as a minimum prerequisite, we comply with the requirements of the legislative frameworks in all countries where we operate and the "ILO Code of Practice on Recording and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases". We also invest in the constant and regular training of all employees, so that they can respond to emergencies affecting both their own and our clients' safety. Especially at the IKEA stores we have created internal Safety, Fire Protection and First Aid teams, while at the INTERSPORT and The Athlete's Foot stores certain employees have been trained in the management of relevant topics.
In addition, aiming to inform employees on health and wellbeing issues and to encourage them to adopt a healthier lifestyle, in 2010 the Group's Social Responsibility Department launched the EF ZIN (WELLBEING) program. In the context of this program a number of actions such as preventive medical examinations, informative speeches on health and wellbeing topics, sports tournaments, etc. are taking place every year.
Outcome of these policies and non-financial key performance indicators Health & Safety at work In 2017, the number of work accidents for all the FOURLIS Group's companies remained at the low levels of 2016.
In addition, as a result of our overall management approach regarding Health & Safety issues in the workplace, in the latest biannual Employee Insight Survey conducted in 2016, the area that gathered the highest satisfaction rate from our employees was Safety.
More information and data pertaining to the results of the policies on employee Health & Safety issues, will be included in the FOURLIS Group's annual Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development Report for 2017.
EF ZIN (WELLBEING) program In 2017, in the context of the EF ZIN program, some indicative activities that took place included a sports tournament in Greece and Cyprus and an initiative in Greece that aimed to inform employees on the importance of a healthy breakfast.

The purpose of General principles is to provide a general framework within which principles can be addressed and more issues of corporate governance can be resolved, either of a listed company or not. Each principle is followed by one or more specific practices that further develop the general principles and guide their implementation within the regulatory and ownership structure of listed companies. The Code follows the approach of compliance or explanation and has the following demands of the listed companies which chose to implement it: the disclosure of their intention and either their compliance with all the specific practices of the Code or their explanation of the reasons leading them not to comply with these specific practices.

Greek Code of Corporate Governance (first modification June 2013)

Explanation/ Justification of deviations from special practices of the Corporate Governance Greek Code

Board members must be elected by shareholders at a maximum term of four (4) years (specific practice 5.1 Nomination of Board Members)

An amendment on Articles of Incorporation is required, which is a decision of the General Assembly. It will be proposed as a change by the termination of the term of the members of the current Board of Directors.

The evaluation of the performance of the Board and its Committees should take place at least every 2 years in line with a clearly established procedure. The evaluation exercise should be led by the Chairman and its results discussed by the Board. The Chairman should act on the results of the performance evaluation by addressing the weaknesses of the Board. The Board should also evaluate the performance of its Chairman. This procedure should be led by the independent Vice - Chairman, if appointed, or by another non - executive Board member (specific practice 7.1, Board evaluation).

The responsibilities of the Board of Directors include the assessment of its Committees. For the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board, the Company has ended up with the use of questionnaires completed by the members of the Board, which are processed by the company's Secretary and presented annually to the Board during the last meeting of every year.

Non - executive Board members should convene periodically without the executive members in order to evaluate the latter performance and discuss their remuneration (specific practice 7.2, Board evaluation).

If stock options are granted, they shouldn't mature in less than three (3) years from grant date (special practice 1.2, Level and structure of remuneration).

The current stock option plan (SOP program) provides maturity to stock options in less than three (3) years from grant date. In case of a new SOP program, there will be a revision of this specific special practice.

Executive Board members' contracts should provide that the Board may demand full or partial recovery of any bonuses awarded on the basis of restated financial statements of previous years or otherwise erroneous financial data used to calculate such bonuses (special practice 1.3, Level and structure of remuneration).

The existing contracts of the Company do not include this term, but a specific reference has been predicted to be made to the last revision of the Code of Conduct distributed to all the employees of the Company.

Report on the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements of Fourlis Holdings S.A. (the Company), which comprise the separate and consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2017, the separate and consolidated income statement, comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of Fourlis Holdings S.A and its subsidiaries (the Group) as at 31 December 2017 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as endorsed by the European Union.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), as incorporated in Greek Law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report. We remained independent of the Company and Group throughout the period of our appointment in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), as incorporated in Greek Law, together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements in Greece, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters and the related risks of material misstatement, were addressed in the context of our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the Key audit matter

Valuation of inventories (consolidated financial statements)

As described in Note 3.13 of the consolidated financial statements, the Group records inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
In the consolidated statement of financial position of December 31, 2017, the Group presents inventories amounting to 77.4 million, which includes a provision for impairment of 1.6 million.
Critical judgement and estimates are exercised by the Group management in identifying and assessing the amount of allowance for inventories, which include among other, estimation of the slow-moving inventories, estimation of obsolete inventories that will be destructed during the following period, evaluation of seasonality and estimation of the future selling prices of the products.
We consider that because of the judgment involved in inventory valuation and the assumptions used by management, in combination with the significance of the amount of inventories to the Group financial statements, valuation of inventories is a key audit matter.
Group discloses the related accounting policies and estimates, and the assumptions used for inventory valuation, in Notes 2.2, 3.13 and 11 of the consolidated financial statements.

We have performed the following procedures:
· Historical costs and margins were tested on a sample basis through reconciliation of purchase cost and margins with the original purchase invoices and sales invoices.
· We assessed whether there were inventories which were sold with a negative margin and whether this was considered for inventory valuation at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
· At year end, we attended on a part of inventory counts in Group stores and distribution centers, to validate on a sample basis whether there were indications of obsolesce.
· We assessed management's estimations for slow moving inventories through observing on a sample basis historical sales and seasonality.
· We evaluated the historical accuracy of allowance of inventories assessed by management by comparing on a sample basis the actual loss from inventory destruction, inventory write offs or other entries related to inventories to the historical allowance.
· Furthermore, on a sample basis, we validated the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations for inventory provision.
We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures which are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Impairment exercise on stores (consolidated financial statements)

Property plant and equipment is a material part of Group total assets (2017: 215.2 million). An amount of 186.7million relates to the net book value of Group stores. In accordance with IFRS, the Group performs impairment test to the stores where an indication of impairment exists. Due to the material carrying value of those assets as well as the judgment and assumptions involved in the identification of any impairment indication and the assessment exercised whether there is a need of impairment or not, we consider the impairment exercise on stores a key audit matter. Group discloses the related accounting policies and estimates, and the assumptions used for the impairment exercise on stores, in Notes 2.2, 3.7 and 7 of the consolidated financial statements.

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following: · · We evaluated the Group policies to identify the Cash Generated Units. · We evaluated the Group policies to identify triggering events for potential im-
pairment of assets in each Cash Generated Unit. · We evaluated management assumptions underlying the potential impairment
calculation for those stores where a triggering event was identified. Valuation specialists supported the audit team. · We evaluated the management estimates for the future cash flows by performing the following audit procedures: (a) We compared forecasted future cash flows of prior years with the actual
cash flows, and (b) We compared the future cash flows that were used in Group models with
market available data and industry trends. · We reviewed the discount rate and residual value calculated by the Group
with regards to the assumptions used, and compared them with the available industry trends and other financial information. · We evaluated the sensitivity analysis of the most significant assumptions used.

We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures which are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information in the Financial Statements. The other information, included in the Annual Report, comprises of the Board of Directors Report, for which reference is also made in section "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements", the Statements of the Members of the Board of Directors, and other complementary information, but does not include the separate and consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the separate and consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company and the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee (Law 44 .4449/2017) is responsible for overseeing the Company's and the Group's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in Greek Law, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate and consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in Greek Law, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control. · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. · Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company and its subsidiaries. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
1. Board of Directors' Report Taking into consideration that management is responsible for the preparation of the Board of Directors' Report and Corporate Governance Statement that is included therein, according to the provisions of paragraph 5 article 2 of Law 4336/2015 (part B), we report that:

Annual Financial Report 73

2. Basis of presentation of the Financial Statements
2.1. Basis of preparation
The accompanying Financial Statements consist of the separate financial statements of the parent Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. The Board of Directors approved the accompanying financial statements for the year ended on December 31 2017, on March 12, 2018. These financial statements are subject to the approval of the General Assembly of the Company's shareholders.
The accompanying separate and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain data of Assets and Liabilities (investment properties and derivative financial instruments) that have been measured at fair value, and assuming that the Company and its subsidiaries will continue as a going concern. All amounts are presented in thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated and any differentiations in sums are due to rounding.
2.2. Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates are based on management's previous experience including expectations of future events under normal conditions. The aforementioned judgments, estimates and assumptions are periodically re - assessed in order to be in line with current available data and reflect current risks.
When applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, estimates and assumptions that may have a significant impact on the items reported in the financial statements:
Estimates: · Deferred Tax assets: deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward unused tax losses can be utilised. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires significant judgments and estimates to be made in relation to the future activities and prospects of the Group companies and as to the level and timing of future taxable profits (Note 3.20 and 23 of Financial Statements). · Fair Values of investment properties: the Group carries its investment properties at fair values as determined by independent appraising firms. he fair values of investment properties are assessed on an annual basis. The determination of the fair values of properties requires management to make assumptions with respect to the market rental rates for similar properties, sales comparables, capitalization and yield rates, and expectations on future rental income (Note 3.8 and 8 of Financial Statements). · Impairment test of investments in subsidiaries: at each reporting date, the Parent Company examines whether there are impairment indicators in relation to its investments in subsidiaries. Such assessment requires management to make significant judgements with respect to the existence of internal or external factors and the extent to which they affect the recoverable amount of these investments. If impairment indicators exist, the Company determines the recoverable amount of these investments. The determination of the recoverable amount requires estimates to be made with respect to the expected future cash flows of the investment, the business plans of the subsidiaries, and the determination of the applicable discount and growth rates. Further details are provided in Note 10. · Impairment test of property, plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment is constantly tested in order to define if there are indications which show that its book value is incorrect. The Group considers, for impairment test purposes, that each store is a cash generating unit (CGU). In cases that property, plant and equipment is part of CGU, such as the store and there are impairment indications which could lead to the conclusion that its book value is incorrect, the recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by the calculation of value in use. Value in use is calculated by implementing the cash flow discount method, taking into consideration Management's estimations and any contingent impairment is determined by the comparison of book value and value in use (Note 7 of Financial Statements). · Useful lives of property plant and equipment: Management makes estimates when determining the useful lives of
74 Annual Financial Report

depreciable assets. Such estimates are periodically reviewed. The useful lives estimated and applied are discussed in Note 3.7 and 3.9. · Post - retirement benefits to personnel: post - retirement obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions which may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of a discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and turnover rates. Due to the complexity of the valuation and the underlying assumptions included therein, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Actuarial gains and losses that result from the difference among the actuarial assumptions are recognized directly in Equity. Such actuarial assumptions are periodically reviewed by management. Further details are provided in Note 19. · Share-based Payments: Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which depends on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option or appreciation right, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 19 of the Financial Statements.
Judgments: · Provisions for impaired receivables: In the subsidiaries of the Segment of Wholesale Trading of Electrical Equipment
the provision of impaired receivables is based on the historical data of receivables. Further details are provided in Note 12. · Provisions for slow moving goods: Inventory turnover ratio is tested regularly and provisions are made for the slow moving goods. Further details are provided in Note 11.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the following accounting principles:
3.1. Basis of Consolidation
Consolidated Financial Statements comprise of the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiaries controlled by the Company directly or indirectly. Control exists when the parent company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The subsidiaries' financial statements are prepared as of the same reporting date and using the same accounting policies as the parent company. Intra - group transactions (including investments in related companies), balances and unrealized gains are eliminated. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences and cease to be consolidated from the date that control is transferred out of the Group. Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non - controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. The financial results of subsidiaries, that are acquired or sold within the year, are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from or up to the date of acquisition or sale, respectively.
Certain of the above - mentioned requirements were applied on a prospective basis based on the revised IAS 27 and therefore the following differences are carried forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation: · Acquisitions of non - controlling interests, prior to January 1, 2010, were accounted for using the parent entity extension
method, whereby, the difference between the consideration and the book value of the share of net assets acquired were recognised as goodwill. · Losses incurred by the Group were attributed to the non - controlling interest until the balance was reduced to nil. Any further excess losses were attributed to the parent, unless the non - controlling interest had a binding obligation to cover these.
3.2. Business Combinations and Goodwill
Business Combination is a transaction or another event during which an acquirer takes over control of one or more
Annual Financial Report 75

businesses. A Business is a combination of activities and assets that can be leaded and managed in order to return profits directly to its owners.
If the acquired assets do not compose a business, the transaction or any other fact are accounted as an acquisition of an asset and the acquisition cost is allocated among assets and liabilities based on the relative fair values during the acquisition date.
Business Combination is accounted for using acquisition method. The cost of acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets contributed, the shares issued and the liabilities assumed at the transaction date, plus the amount of any non - controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non - controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net asset. Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair values of the net identifiable assets acquired, the difference is recorded directly to the income statement.
Goodwill arising from subsidiaries' acquisitions is recorded as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not amortized but at least annually is subject to impairment test. As a result, after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost, less any impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each cash generating unit that is expected to benefit from the combination. The impairment test is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to its carrying value including the allocated goodwill. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The value in use is determined via a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Gains or losses arising from the disposal of subsidiaries are determined after taking into account the goodwill allocated to the disposed unit.
3.3 Investments in subsidiaries
In the separate financial statements of the Parent Company, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost, less any impairment in value. Impairment tests are carried out when there are clear indicators of impairment, in accordance with IAS 36 "Impairment of Assets".
3.4 Investments in associates
Associates are those entities, in which the Group has significant influence but which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Group. A percentage holding from 20% to 50% implies significant influence. Such percentage holding indicates that company is an associate. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method based on which the investment is carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate, less provisions for any impairment in value. Goodwill arising upon the acquisition of associates is included in the value of investment, while any negative goodwill is recorded in the income statement upon acquisition.
The Group's share in the gains or losses of associates after acquisition is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income, while post - acquisition movements in reserves are recognized directly in reserves.
In applying the equity method of accounting, the Group appropriately adjusts the financial statements of those associates who are not applying IFRS so as to comply with IFRS and be uniform with the accounting policies of the Group. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the transferred asset.
When the Group's participation to the associate's losses equals or exceeds its interest in an associate, including any other bad debts, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has any liabilities or made payments on behalf of the associate and generally those arising from the ownership status. In the separate financial statements of the Parent Company, investments in associates are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

According to the aforementioned, the Group presents information by operating segment as follows: · Retail Trading of Home Furniture and Household Goods (IKEA stores). · Retail Trading of Sporting Goods (INTERSPORT and TAF stores).
3.6 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional currency and reporting currency The companies of the Group maintain their books in the currency of the financial environment in which each company operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro's which is the functional currency of the parent company.
(b) Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the functional currency according to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Foreign exchange differences on non-monetary items carried at fair value are considered as part of the fair value of those items and are recorded together with the fair value adjustments.
(c) Foreign Group Companies Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using the functional currency. The translation of the financial statements of the Group's companies which use a different functional currency from the parent company is performed as follows: · Assets and liabilities are translated to Euro at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the Statement of Financial
Position. · Equity is translated at historic rates. · Income and expenses are translated using the average foreign exchange rate of the period and on an annual base
according to the average foreign exchange rate of the last twelve (12) months. · The resulting foreign exchange differences (gains/losses) are recognized in other comprehensive income and in Foreign
Exchange differences from Statement of Financial Position translation Reserve. When subsidiaries operating in foreign countries are sold, accumulated foreign exchange differences existing in the Foreign Exchange differences from Statement of Financial Position translation Reserve are recognized to the statement of income as gains or losses from investments sales.
Goodwill and adjustments to fair values upon an acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing rate of the date of the Statement of Financial Position.
3.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured, by category, as follows: · All categories of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
losses.
Annual Financial Report 77

· Cost includes all directly attributable costs for the acquisition of the items of property, plant and equipment. These costs include borrowing costs of loans drawn to finance the acquisition or construction of assets which are capitalized until the date when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Significant additions and improvements are recognised as part of the cost of the asset when the recognition criteria are met. All other costs (repairs and maintenance) are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred.

Upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value is recorded as gain or loss in the Income Statement.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight - line basis over the estimated useful economic life of the assets. Useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis.

The estimated useful lives of the Group's property plant and equipment, except of the land that is not depreciated, are as follows:

Category Buildings - Building installations (owned premises) Buildings on third party land Machinery and equipment Motor vehicles Miscellaneous equipment

Useful life 10 - 40 years 10 ­ 36 years 9 - 10 years
6 - 9 years 4 - 10 years

Owner - occupied buildings or buildings whose use has not yet been determined and which are under construction are recorded at cost less any impairment losses. This cost includes professional compensations and borrowing costs. The depreciation of that owner - occupied buildings begins from the time the buildings are ready for use.

3.8 Investment property

Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is stated at fair value, which is evaluated annually. The carrying value of investment property reflects the market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment property fair value are recognized in the Income Statement of the period they occur.

3.9 Intangible assets

The intangible assets of the Group (excluding goodwill) are depreciated over their useful life which is annually reviewed.

· Royalties Trademarks and licenses are valued at cost less amortization. Amortization is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight - line basis over the estimated useful lives, which have been determined from 5 to 20 years.

· Software - Other intangible assets Software licenses are valued at cost less amortization. Amortization is charged on a straight - line basis over the estimated useful lives and the depreciation rate is 15%.

Expenditure on development and maintenance of software is expensed as incurred. Expenditure of development activities for the production of new or substantially improved software (in - house developments), is recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met: a) when a specific asset is created, b) when it can be demonstrated that the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits and c) when the expenditures of development can be measured reliably. Such expenditures include also labour costs and an appropriate proportion of overheads. In case of software replacement, while the old one is no longer in use, intangible asset is permanently deleted from the Books and the net book value burdens the income statement.

Costs incurred for performing software upgrades, are capitalised and the new gross value forms the depreciable amount.

78 Annual Financial Report

3.10 Impairment of non - financial assets except Goodwill
Property, plant and equipment is constantly tested in order to define if there are indications which show that its book value is incorrect. The Group considers, for impairment test purposes, that each store is a cash generating unit (CGU). In cases that property, plant and equipment is part of CGU, such as the store and there are impairment indications which could lead to the conclusion that its book value is incorrect, the recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by the calculation of value in use. Value in use is calculated by implementing the cash flow discount method, taking into consideration Management's estimations and any contingent impairment is determined by the comparison of book value and value in use.
The carrying amounts of the Group's assets are reviewed for possible impairment when there is indication that the book value can not be recovered i.e. when the book value is higher than the recoverable amount from their use or sale.
The recoverable value is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre - tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the recoverable value is less than the carrying value, then the net book value is reduced to the recoverable value.
Impairment losses are expensed as incurred in the Statement of Income, except if the asset has been revalued, then the impairment loss reduces the related revaluation reserve. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exists of have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. When in a subsequent period, the impairment loss should be reversed; the carrying value of the asset is increased to the level of the revised estimation of recoverable amount. The new net book value should not exceed the net book value that would have been determined if the impairment losses had not been accounted in previous periods.
3.11 Financial instruments
A financial instrument consists of every agreement that creates a financial asset in a business and a financial liability or equity instrument in another business.
The Group's financial instruments are classified at initial recognition in the following categories based on the substance of the agreement and the purpose for which they were acquired:
i) Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Such financial assets, represent assets, which satisfy any of the following conditions: · Financial assets held for trading (including derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedging
relationships, those that are acquired or created in order to be sold or re - acquired and those which form part of a portfolio of recognized financial means). · Financial assets designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
ii) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non - derivative financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in active market. This category does not include: · Receivables from advances for the purchase of goods or services, · Receivables resulting from tax transactions imposed by law, · Any item not dealt with by an agreement giving the right to an entity to collect cash or other financial assets.
Loans and receivables are included in current liabilities/ assets, except of those whose maturity extends beyond twelve (12) months after the reporting date and which are classified as non - current liabilities/ assets. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
Annual Financial Report 79

iii) Held - to - maturity Investments Non - derivative financial items with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held - to maturity when the Group has the intent and ability to hold to term to maturity. After initial measurement, held - to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
iv) Available - for - sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets which are classified under this category or which cannot be classified under any of the three preceding categories. Financial assets available for sales are valued at fair value and the unrealised gains or losses are recognised as other comprehensive income in a reserve under equity until the item is sold or impaired. At the date of sale or impairment, the gains or losses are transferred to the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the item. Investments are initially recorded at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable transactions costs. Investments are derecognised when the right to the cash flows of the investment expire or are transferred and the Group has substantially transferred all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the investment.
The fair values of financial assets, which are traded on active markets, are determined by reference to quoted prices. The fair value of financial assets not traded on active markets is determined by using valuation techniques such as use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis.
3.12 Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
· Assets carried at amortized cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognized in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortized cost at the reversal date.
· Available for sale financial assets For equity instruments classified as available for sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below cost. Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss - measured at the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value - is removed from other comprehensive income and recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement. In the case of debt instruments classified as available for sale, impairment losses are reversed through the income statements
80 Annual Financial Report

if an increase in the fair value of the debt instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the income statement.
3.13 Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by using the weighted average method. The cost of completed products and incomplete inventory includes the cost of direct raw materials, the direct labor cost and the general industrial expenses. The net realizable value is the estimated sales price at the ordinary operation of the company less any costs to sell having in mind seasonality and other conditions. The cost of inventory does not include any financial expenses.
3.14 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and they are subsequently valuated at the amortised cost by using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
When there is evidence of impairment of receivables, the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount, which is the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate. Then, the interest is calculated at the same rate on the impaired (new book) value.
3.15 Cash
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at banks and on hand, as well as short term (up to 3 months) investments of high liquidation and low risk.
3.16 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation are valued at the lower price between carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any possible fair value increase in a subsequent valuation is registered in Profit and loss but for amounts not bigger than the initially registered impairment loss. Since the date on which an asset is classified as held for sale, this asset is no longer depreciated or amortized. Non-current assets held for sale are classified as such, provided that their carrying value will be recovered through sale rather than through continuing use. This condition is considered valid only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale at its current condition. Management requires commitment to the sale which is expected to be completed either based on stipulated by contractual time commitment or within a year from classification date.
A discontinued operation is an integral part of a financial entity that either has been sold or has been classified as held for sale and: a) represents a separate major part of business operations or a geographical area of operations, b) is part of a single, coordinated divestment program of a great part of operations or a geographical area of operations or c) is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with the prospect to be resold.
3.17 Share Capital
Direct costs incurred for increases in share capital are recorded, net of related income taxes against the share premium reserve. The cost of treasury shares net of any related income tax is recorded as a reduction of equity, until these shares are sold or cancelled. Any gain or loss on sale of treasury shares, net of direct transaction costs and any related income tax is recorded as a reserve account under equity.
3.18 Loans
Loans are initially recorded at their fair value less any direct costs related to the transaction. After initial recognition, they are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest and related expenses on loans taken for purchase or construction of fixed assets are capitalized. Capitalisation of
Annual Financial Report 81

borrowing costs ceases when the asset is ready for its intended use. In case of borrowing specifically for the purpose of constructing or acquiring an asset, the borrowing costs related to the loan agreement are directly capitalised. Otherwise, in order to determine the part of the loan related with that fixed asset, a method is implemented to determine the proportion of the capitalized interest and the proportion of the interest which will be recorded to the statement of comprehensive income as an expense. Revenues, occurred as a result of investing part of a loan taken for construction of a fixed asset, reduce the amount of borrowing costs capitalized.
3.19 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
The effective part of hedges that qualify for hedge accounting is recognized directly to equity if it is related to cash flow hedges while the ineffective part is charged to the consolidated income statement, while the non - effective part is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. If the hedge is related to effective fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in profit or loss and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss.
Under cash flow hedge accounting, when the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of non - financial asset or a non - financial liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognized the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognized in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the statement of comprehensive income.
3.20 Current and Deferred Tax
Taxes recorded in the statement of comprehensive income include both current and deferred taxes.
Current income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity. In this case it is recognised, in a similar way, directly in equity. Current income taxes include the current liabilities and/ or assets, to or from the tax authorities, relating to the taxes payable on the taxable income of the period. Current taxes are increased by any income taxes related to provisions for tax differences or additional taxes which are imposed by the tax authorities upon audit of the unaudited tax years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the year where the asset or liability will be settled, taking into account the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or are virtually applicable at the reporting date.
Deferred taxes arise on temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax purposes and those for the purposes of preparation of the financial statements. Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on all taxable temporary differences at the reporting date, between the tax basis and book value of assets and liabilities.
The expected tax effects of temporary tax differences are recognized either as deferred tax liabilities or as deferred tax assets. In case of an inability to accurately measure temporary tax differences, the initial recognition is made based on estimation of the reversal time and such estimation is reviewed each year.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which the unused tax losses and tax credits can be used or sufficient taxable deductible temporary differences that incur in the same company and will be recovered. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that is unlikely that sufficient taxable income will be generated in order to recover the deferred tax asset.
82 Annual Financial Report

The Group sets off deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities only if: · it has a legal right to set off current tax receivables against current tax payables and · deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income tax imposed by the same tax authority.

As a result deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the separate financial statements of the Company while such items are presented separately in the consolidated accounts of the Group.

If the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than business combination, then it does not affect the neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss and therefore it is not taken into account.

The tax rates in the countries that the Group is operating presented below:

Country Greece Romania Cyprus Bulgaria Turkey

% Income Tax/ Deferred Tax 29,0% 16,0% 12,5% 10,0% 20,0%

3.21 Employee Benefits
Employee benefits are:
a) Short term benefits Short term benefits to employees in money or in kind are recorded as an expense as they accrue.
b) Post - retirement benefits According to the regulations of Law 2112/ 1920 amended by the article 74 paragraph 2 of the Law 3863/2010 and completed be the Law 3899/17-12-10 article 17 paragraph 5a and the Law 4093/12, the Greek subsidiaries of the Group pay retirement compensation to their employees. Such compensation varies in relation to the employees' years of service and salary payable at the time of retirement and is accounted for as a defined benefit plan. Post - retirement obligations are calculated at the present value of future employee benefits accrued as at the end of the reporting period, based on the benefits to be earned over their expected labor life. The above mentioned obligations are calculated based on actuarial valuation methods and are determined using the Projected Unit Method. Net costs of the period are included in the attached statement of comprehensive income and consist of the present value of the employee benefits that were accrued during the current year, the interest derived from the employee benefit obligation and the actuarial gains and losses which are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the comprehensive income and they are not transferred in income statement in next periods. Full yield curve method is used for the definition of the discount interest rate in the calculation of the present value of the employee benefits.
c) State insurance programs The employees of the Greek subsidiaries of the Group are covered, in terms of insurance programs, mainly through the Social Insurance Institution (IKA) the largest Social Security Organization of the private sector, which supplies pension and medical coverage. Every employee is obliged to participate partially, through his salary, in the costs of the insurance program, while the remaining cost is covered by the Group. Upon retirement, the pension fund is responsible to cover the obligation of pensions and retirement benefits to the employees. As a consequence the Group does not have any other legal or future obligation to cover future employee benefits according to this pension program. This program is considered and accounted for as a defined contribution plan whereby the accrued social security contributions are recorded as an expense in the financial period in which they are incurred.
d) Private insurance programs Every full time employee of the Group belonging to the management team, according to the internal company policy, is covered by a private insurance pension and other benefits program. The Group covers, the contract defined fees, while the

Annual Financial Report 83

financial management of the program is performed by the insurance company. This program is considered and accounted for as a defined contribution plan whereby the accrued cost of the insurance fees is recorded as expense in the period in which they are incurred.
e) Stock option plan The Company intends to attract, retain and incentivise the executives of the Company and the executives of its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as through the Stock Options plan, the participants have a direct equity interest in the Company which link their performance to the Company's future performance and the increase of shareholder value. This program regards equity shares transactions.
The Company makes decisions regarding the implementation of the Stock Option Plan ­ to executives of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in compliance with par.5 of Art.42e of Law 2190/1920.
A basic condition for participation in the Stock Options plan is the salaried working relationship of executives with the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates.The cost of equity settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair values at the date in which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the period from grant date to maturity date of the options with a concurrent increase in equity.
The program takes into account the following variables: Exercise price, Share price at grant date, Grant Date, Maturity date(s) of rights, Expected Stock Volatility (Volatility), Dividend Yield, Risk Free Rate.
3.22 Government grants
Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as deferred income and amortized over the expected useful life of the related asset. Such amortization is presented in other income in Statement of Comprehensive Income.
3.23 Contingent liabilities and Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal, contractual or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the present value of the expense expected to be required to settle the liability.
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless there is a probability of financial outflow or inflow.
3.24 Revenue and expense recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of sales of goods and provision of services, net of Value Added Tax, discounts and returns. Inter - company revenues are eliminated.
The recognition of revenue is accounted for as follows: · Sales of goods: Sales of goods are recognized when the Group invoices and delivers the goods to the customers and
the goods are accepted by them. Retail sales are through cash payments or through credit cards. In these cases the income recorded is the amount received by the customer. In the case of guarantees for returned retail sales value the returns are recorded as incurred. · Provision of services: The income from provision of services is recorded in the period in which the services are provided, based on the stage of completion of the provided service. · Interest income: Interest income is recognized proportionally in time and by using the effective interest rate.
84 Annual Financial Report

· Dividends: Dividends are recorded as income when the right to collect vests which is upon the decision of the General Assembly of Shareholders (ordinary or extraordinary). Expenses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as accrued
· Advertising costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in distribution expenses. · Borrowing costs: Underwriters costs, legal and other direct costs incurred during the issue of long term loans are
deducted from the loan balances and are recorded to the statement of comprehensive income based on the effective interest rate method over the duration of the loan. Borrowing cost is recognized as an expense during the issue period, except of the case that Group capitalizes borrowing costs according to IAS 23.
3.25 Leases
Leases in which all the risks and benefits of the property remain with the lessor are recorded as finance leases. All the other leasing contracts are recorded as operating leases. · Group as a Lessor: Income from operating leasing is recognised as income on a straight - line basis over the lease
term. · Group as a Lessee: Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight - line basis over the lease
term. Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased item regardless of whether there is a transfer of the ownership title or not at the end of the lease, are classified as finance leases. The property held under finance leases is capitalized at the inception of the lease at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction in the lease liability and the financial expenses in order to achieve a constant interest rate on the residual financial liability. The related lease liabilities net of financial expenses are classified as liabilities and the related financial expenses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income over the duration of the lease. Property, plant and equipment acquired through a finance lease are depreciated at the lower of the assets' useful lives and the lease term.
The Group as a Lessor only has operating leasing while as a Lessee has both operating and finance leasing. Both operational anf financial leasing are related to buildings and machinery.
3.26 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are not offset in the financial statements unless there is a legal right of set - off and intention for settlement of the net amount or settlement of the asset and liability simultaneously.
3.27 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
·Financial Assets A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognized where: · the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, · the Group or the Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation
to pay them in full without material delay under a "pass - through" arrangement and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the assets, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Groups´ continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Annual Financial Report 85

·Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.
3.28 Earnings/Losses per share
The basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profits after taxes with the weighted average number of shares of each period/ year.
The weighted average number of shares arises by summing the outstanding shares into which the share capital is divided and the rights that can be contingently exercised and are owned by the company and subtracting the shares buy back.
3.29 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following amended IFRSs which have been adopted by the Group and the Company as of 1 January 2017:  IAS 12: Income Taxes (Amendments): Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses
The objective of the Amendments is to clarify the accounting treatment of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses regarding assets valuated at fair value.For instance, amendments clarify accounting treatment of deferred assets in case that the entity is not allowed to deduct unrealized tax losses or in case that intends to retain the assets untile the reverse of unrealized losses.  IAS 7: Cash Flow Statements (Amendments): Disclosure Initiative The objective of the Amendments is to allow users of financial statements to assess the changes in financial liabilities. The amendments will require fro entities to provide disclosures which allow investors to assess the changes in financial liabilities, including changes related to cash or non cash nature.
The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 ­ 2016 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The following annual improvement has not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management assesses the impact of the amendment on the companies of the Group.  IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
The amendments clarify that the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12, other than those of summarized financial information for subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, apply to an entity's interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate that is classified as held for sale, as held for distribution, or as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5.
Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted  IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Classification and Measurement
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. At the year 2017, the reflect of the implementation of IFRS 9 was assessed and therefore the impact of the new standard is expected as follows: - The financial instruments that the Group holds on 31/12/2017, will continue to be measured on the same base in
compliance with IFRS 9 and therefore there is no expectation for significant impact on classification and measurement of financial instruments of assets due to the implementation of the new IFRS standard. - Moreover, there will be no impact regarding the Group's financial liabilities, given that the instructions of the new IFRS standard affect only the accounting treatment of financial liabilities determined at their fair value through income statement and the Group does not have such liabilities.
86 Annual Financial Report

 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model that will apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction or the industry. The standard is based on the principle that the revenue is recognized when the control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. The Group plans to adopt the new standard by readjusting cumulatively the retained earnings. Within 2017, an initial assessment was conducted regarding the impact of IFRS 15 and then conducted a detailed analysis of differences per revenue category between the new standard and the current accounting policies completed within the same year. Based on the above, the new standard is not expected to significantly affect the consolidated financial statements of the Group upon its implementation.
 IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications) The Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The objective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB's intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, regarding (a) the accounting of performance obligations amending the wording of the "separately identifiable" principle, (b) principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is a principal or an agent as well as applications of control principle and (c) licensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach.
 IFRS 16: Leases The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer (`lessee') and the supplier (`lessor'). The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases on their financial statements. Lessees will have a single accounting model for all leases, with certain exemptions. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged. The standard will affect mainly the accounting treatment of operational leases of the Group. At the date of the balancesheet, the Group has non-canceled operantional leases of amount  228 mil. The Group as not yet determined to what extent these commitments will lead to assets and liabilities recognition regarding future payments, as well as that this will affect profit and cash flow classification of the Group. This happens because some of these commitments may be excluded from the standard's requirements as short-term or/and of nonimportant value, while some commitments may not even meet the criteria requires for their characterization as leases according to IFRS 16.
 Amendment in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures - Amendment: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The amendments address an acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28, in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary. In December 2015 the IASB postponed the effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research project on the equity method of accounting. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management of the Group and Company estimates that the specific amendment will not have an impact on its financial statements.
 IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share based Payment Transactions (Amendments) The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The Amendments provide requirements on the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments, for share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations and for modifications to the terms and conditions of a sharebased payment that changes the classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management is in the process of assessment of the amendment's impact on the companies of the Group.
 IAS 40: Transfers to Investment Property (Amendments) The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The Amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development
Annual Financial Report 87

into, or out of investment property. The Amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use. A mere change in management's intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management is in the process of assessment of the amendment's impact on the companies of the Group.  IFRS 9: Prepayment features with negative compensation (Amendment) The Amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The Amendment allows financial assets with prepayment features that permit or require a party to a contract either to pay or receive reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract (so that, from the perspective of the holder of the asset there may be `negative compensation'), to be measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management of the Group and Company estimates that the specific amendment will not have an impact on its financial statements.  IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments) The Amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The Amendments relate to whether the measurement, in particular impairment requirements, of long term interests in associates and joint ventures that, in substance, form part of the `net investment' in the associate or joint venture should be governed by IFRS 9, IAS 28 or a combination of both. The Amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, before it applies IAS 28, to such long-term interests for which the equity method is not applied. In applying IFRS 9, the entity does not take account of any adjustments to the carrying amount of long- term interests that arise from applying IAS 28. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management of the Group and Company estimates that the specific amendment will not have an impact on its financial statements.
 IFRIC INTERPETATION 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration The Interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency. The Interpretation covers foreign currency transactions when an entity recognizes a non-monetary asset or a non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration before the entity recognizes the related asset, expense or income. The Interpretation states that the date of the transaction, for the purpose of determining the exchange rate, is the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayment asset or deferred income liability. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity must determine a date of the transactions for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. This Interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management is in the process of assessment of impact on the companies of the Group.
The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 ­ 2016 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 for IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and for IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Earlier application is permitted for IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. These annual improvements have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management is in the  IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: This improvement deletes the short-
term exemptions regarding disclosures about financial instruments, employee benefits and investment entities, applicable for first time adopters.  IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: The amendments clarify that the election to measure at fair value through profit or loss an investment in an associate or a joint venture that is held by an entity that is venture capital organization, or other qualifying entity, is available for each investment in an associate or joint venture on an investment-by-investment basis, upon initial recognition.
 IFRIC INTERPETATION 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments The Interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12. The Interpretation provides guidance on considering uncertain tax treatments separately or together, examination by tax authorities, the appropriate method to reflect uncertainty and accounting for changes in

Company 31/12/2016 6.686 0 0 6.970 1.531 0 15.187

Statutory Reserve: In accordance with the provisions of Greek company law, the creation of a statutory reserve, through the transfer of the 5% of the annual after tax profits, is mandatory up until the reserve reaches 1/3 of the share capital. The statutory reserve is only distributable upon dissolution of the Company, it may however be used to set - off accumulated losses.

Extraordinary / Tax-free Reserves: The Group has Extraordinary/Tax-free Reserves of amount  16.313 thousand (2016:  16.518 thousand), which was mainly derived from shares sales listed in Athesn Stock Exchange, dividends, interests and income from doubtful debt provision of L. 3296/04. In case of distribution or capitalisation the reserves will be taxed with the official tax rate declared by L4172/2013 (Note 23).

Exchange Differences from subsidiaries accounts conversion: This reserve is comprised from the foreign exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the financial statements of Subsidiaries which have a different functional currency from the parent company.

Cash Flow Hedging reserve: The hedging reserve comprises of the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments (IRS) (Note 21).

18.Dividends
The Shareholders Ordinary General Assembly held on 16/6/2017 did not propose a dividend distribution for the year 1/1 ­ 31/12/2016. The parent company registered in its income dividend from subsidiary of amount  5 million during the year 2017.

19.Employee retirement benefits

19.1 Liabilities due to termination of service

The obligation of employee compensation due to termination of service (Law 2112/20, 4093/12 for Greek Companies, Bulgarian Labor Law for Bulgarian Companies and Labor Law 1475 for Turkish Company) appears in the Financial Statements in compliance with IAS 19 and is based on an actuarial study elaborated by AON Hewitt on December 31st,2017.

Basic assumptions of the actuarial study for Greece are the following:

Greek Companies Average annual payroll increase Discount interest rate Inflation Plan duration (years)

2017 1,00% 1,59% - 1,80% 1,00% 16-23

2016 1,00% 1,65% - 1,90% 1,00% 15-24

In case of an average annual payroll increase by 0,50% (namely 1,50%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Greek companies would increase from 7,93% to 11,84%. In case of a discount rate increase by 0,50%, the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Greek companies would decrease from 7,17% to 10,73%.

2017 3,50% 1,70% 2,00% 24-28

2016 3,50% 2,15% 2,00% 24-29

In case of an average annual payroll increase by 0,50% (namely 4,00%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Bulgarian companies would increase from 12,08% to 14,33%. In case of a discount rate increase by 0,50% (namely 2,20%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service of Bulgarian companies would decrease from 10,80% to 12,65%.

Turkish Company Average annual payroll increase Discount interest rate Inflation Plan duration (years)

2016 7,10% 10,00% 5,10%

In case of an inflation increase by 0,50% (namely 5,60%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service would increase by 11,00% for INTERSPORT ATLETK MAAZACILIK VE DI TCARET A.. In case of a discount rate increase by 0,50% (namely 11,00%), the amount of liabilities due to termination of service would decrease by 10,00% for INTERSPORT ATLETK MAAZACILIK VE DI TCARET A.. In the analysis of sensitivity of Turkey, a reference is made to the inflation rate and not to compensation increase because benefits in Turkey are subject to a maximum salary (plafond) and an increase/decrease of inflation will affect the maximum salary.

The expense derived from the compensation to employees due to retirement, that was recorded in the Income Statement of the financial year 2017 is analysed as follows:

19.2 Share based payments
The Ordinary General Assembly of the Company of June 16, 2017, under the context of Stock Option Plan, approved the disposal of 2.566.520 stock options and the authorization to the Board of Directors regarding the settlement of procedures and details. The program will be implemented in four waves, with a maturity period of five years per wave. Options should be exercised within five years since their maturity date. In case that, after the grant some of the options remain undisposed, those options will be cancelled. The underlying price of each wave is the closing stock price on the day of General Assembly's resolution regarding the approval of the program.
On 20/11/2017 the board of Directors granted 641.630 Stock Options, which are the first of the four waves. The underlying share price, to which conferred options reflect, is determined at the amount of 5,768  per share which is the closing stock price of the share (adjusted with the share capital decrease which took place after the date of the General Assembly).

Due to corporate events (capital return by cash payment), the historical closing price of the share was readjusted and formed at the amount of  3,34 per share.

During the period 1/1 ­ 31/12/2017, beneficiaries waived their right to exercise 11.580 options (2016: 6.659) which were granted by the BoD on 25/11/2013, beneficiaries waived their right to exercise 13.626 options (2016: 6.548) which were granted by the BoD on 24/11/2014 and also beneficiaries waived their right to exercise 26.097 options (2016: 13.158) which were granted by the BoD on 25/11/2015.

20.Financial Instruments and Risk Management Policies
20.1 Credit Risk

During year 2017, the Group managed to maintain the improved credit terms from its main suppliers.

20.3 Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign exchange risk exposure The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from its transactions in foreign currencies (RON, USD, TRY, SEK). The percentage of the balance of suppliers in currency other than the publication currency (euro) is 14,56% of the total. The Group, in order to minimize the foreign exchange risk, in certain cases pre - purchases foreign currencies.

The Group has investments in companies overseas, the net assets of which are exposed to foreign exchange risk. This type of foreign exchange risk (translation risk) arises due to the operations in Romania (RON), Bulgaria (BGN) and Turkey (TRY). The Management has managed to reduce foreign exchange risk, given the strong capital structure of the companies and to decrease borrowings in currencies other than the local.

More particularly, approximately 90% of GENCO TRADE SRL loans, which is located in Romania, are in local currency (RON) in an effort to avoid the exchange difference charges resulting from RON devaluating vs. the Euro. In Bulgaria the local currency is pegged to the Euro (EUR/ BGN = 1.95583) a fact which can not guarantee that economic problems and consequences of the global crisis on Bulgaria, will not increase the risk that this conversion ratio will remain constant. In Turkey, the financing for commercial activity is in local currency, while for investments is in euro.

20.4 Interest Rate Fluctuation Exposure
Profile The Group is subject to cash flow risks which in the case of possible variable interest rates fluctuation, may affect positively or negatively the cash inflows or outflows related to the Group's assets or liabilities. Despite of the fact that we believe that in an environment of prolonged global slowdown, the risk of rising interest rates remains low, the group has entered into Interest Rate Swap (IRS) contracts effectively converting part of the loans from floating to fixed interest rate for a period of 3 to 5 years.
The profile of Group's loan liabilities at the date of the Statement of Financial Position is analysed in paragraph Borrowings.
Sensitivity Analysis of fair value for financial instruments with a variable interest rate A 1% fluctuation of the Group's borrowing rate at December 31, would increase (decrease) equally the Net Equity and the Operating Results by  1.444 thousand for the year 2017 and  1.481 thousand for the year 2016.
Sensitivity Analysis of fair value for financial instruments with a fixed interest rate No such Instruments (Assets/Liabilities) valued at fair value through income statement exist.

20.5 Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amounts of the financial instruments of assets and liabilities (i.e. trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments, borrowings and finance leases) approximate their fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between two market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of the financial instruments as of 31 December 2017 represent management's best estimate. In situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Group's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Those judgments are developed by the Group based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: · Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; · Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; · Level 3: Assets or liabilities prices that are not corroborated by market data.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: · Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables accounts: the carrying amounts
approximate their fair value either due to the short maturity of these instruments or because there is no foreign currency risk exposure. · Borrowings: The carrying amount approximates their fair value mainly due to the fact that they bear interest at floating rates and are denominated in local currency.

104 Annual Financial Report

· Derivative financial instruments: The valuation method was determined by taking into consideration all factors in order to determine precisely fair value, such as the current and the prospective interest rates trend and the duration and falls into level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Within the year, there were neither moving between levels 1 and 2 nor moving inside and outside level 3 during the measurement of fair value. Moreover, within the same year, there was no change in the purpose of any financial asset which would lead to a different classification of this asset.

20.6 Capital Management
The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure and maintain strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order to support the investment projects and maximizing the return of invested capital for the shareholders.
The Group monitors its capital management through the use of a gearing ratio - net debt divided by equity plus net debt where net debt includes interest bearing loans and borrowings minus cash. The Group's strategic objective is to maintain the above ratio between 30% and 45%. On 31/12/2017 the ratio stood at 39% (2016: 41%).

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between assets and liabilities tax recognition and financial statements composition.

On 31/12/2017, the Group had accumulated carried forward tax losses in its subsidiaries on part of which a provision was made for deferred tax asset of amount  6.846 thousand (31/12/2016:  8.134 thousand) as the Management considered that the recognition criteria were met. For the part of tax losses on which a deferred tax asset has been recognized, the Management estimates that they will be covered against taxable profits before their expiration date.

Given that some of the Group companies have not been audited by the tax authorities for a few years, as mentioned above, it is considered by the Group that adequate provisions for current and future tax audit differences have been made. On 31/12/2017, the cumulative Group's provision for unaudited tax years amounts to  139 thousand ( 2.054 th. on 31/12/2016) and to  20 thousand for the Company as at 31/12/2017 ( 20 th. on 31/12/2016) which is displayed in Income Tax Payable.

24.Earnings/Losses per share

The basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares during the period. The weighted average number of shares as at 31 December 2017 is 51.643.688 (31/12/2016: 51.330.410).
