A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Bringing opportunity and growth to every corner of the world
For A.P. Moller - Maersk, 2018 was a year of building the foundation for our future business, and we have made significant progress on the transformation of A.P. Moller - Maersk.
The transformation of A.P. Moller ­ Maersk was initiated in 2016, based on our strategy to focus A.P. Moller ­ Maersk on becoming the global integrator of container transportation and logistics to enable global trade in an efficient, simple and sustainable way.
Since the announcement of the new strategy, we have worked hard to change the company from being a diversified conglomerate with individual business units in different industries to become an integrated and focused company leading the transforming of the transportation industry.
Laying the foundation for growth and development
In 2018, we completed the process of finding new structural solutions for the majority of the energy-related businesses, which will

enable them to continue to develop and grow under new ownership structures.
The sale of Maersk Oil to oil major Total S.A. was completed in March. The new owner is financially strong and has a long-term interest in the industry. Total S.A. has made Denmark a hub for Total S.A.'s North Sea activities, ensuring the best possible foundation for the continued development of the people, capabilities and assets of Maersk Oil and, not least, the Danish North Sea shelf.
In August 2018, we decided to pursue a demerger of A.P. Moller - Maersk via a separate listing of Maersk Drilling on Nasdaq Copenhagen in 2019, which will offer our shareholders the opportunity to participate in the continued development of Maersk Drilling.
Maersk Drilling owns and operates a fleet of 23 mobile offshore drilling rigs specialising in harsh environment and deepwater operations and is recognised for its safe, efficient, and reliable drilling services to some of the leading and most innovative oil and gas companies

around the world. With superior financial uptime compared to peers, reflecting the company's focus on consistency, safety and reliability, Maersk Drilling is positioned as the contractor of choice among E&P operators. Maersk Drilling's management has done a remarkable job in preparing the company to operate as a standalone company and is organisationally and financially well-prepared for a listing.
Maersk Supply Service progressed on their divestment programme and strategy to diversify its business into new markets in 2018, and the pursuit of the long-term solution will continue. However, the timing for defining a solution remains difficult to predict due to the continued challenges in their core market.
The core of A.P. Moller ­ Maersk's transfor mation is enhanced customer service and added value for our investors. Furthermore, it is important that A.P. Moller - Maersk maintains a strong financial position with a solid capital structure to be able to pursue the necessary investments through this process.

Directors' report Overview

Based on the foundation laid in 2018, we will accelerate the transformation in 2019.

During 2018 the net interest-bearing debt has been reduced by around USD 6bn to USD 8.7bn, through free cash flow generation from the operations, and cash proceeds related to both the separation of Maersk Oil and Maersk Drilling.

complexity and increasing the visibility and bringing much-needed simplicity to supply chains and documents. As the world's largest transportation and logistics network, A.P. Moller - Maersk is well placed to lead the digital transformation of the industry.

Contributing to growth and prosperity worldwide
In parallel to our efforts to complete the separation of our energy-related businesses, we have progressed on strengthening the fundamentals of our transport and logistics business towards profitable growth. In 2018, we successfully completed the integration of Hamburg Süd and delivered significant revenue growth and market share expansion further strengthening our number one position within ocean container transportation.

Safety and sustainable development
In 2018, seven people regrettably lost their lives while engaged in operational activities, and my deepest condolences go to the families of the victims. Accidents are never intentional but occur as the result of many factors co- inciding. The Board and the management team have decided to focus on safety and build organisational capacity and operational controls that will act as barriers to accidents that could otherwise have escalated to cause life-changing or fatal outcomes.

Digitalisation is a key enabler of transforming both A.P. Moller - Maersk and the industry. Innovative digital solutions delivered by A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2018 are removing the

Carrying around 80% of global trade, the ship ping industry is vital in finding solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges; climate change. As an industry leader, we

7

A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

have a responsibility to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Since 2008, we have achieved a 41% reduction of our emission relative to cargo moved. In December 2018, we set a goal of reaching carbon neutrality in our Ocean segment by 2050.
The Board of Directors is proud to see the ambition level and the commitment from management to contribute to sustainable development ­ in particular to help decarbonise logistics, contribute to halving food loss, help multiply the benefits of trade and lead the change in the ship recycling industry.
Rewarding for performance
We believe in rewarding all employees, including executives, for delivering exceptional performance, building shareholder value and working towards the company vision of becoming the global integrator of container logistics.
Our executive remuneration policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate a highly effec tive and engaged executive team to support the achievement of our vision. In 2018 we have updated our cash-based short-term incentive scheme and our share-based long-term incentive scheme to better align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. The schemes are based on the following criteria: collaboration, agility, customer and people orientation and rewarding individual performance, as well as to which extent the organisation meets the financial and strategic objectives that drive the growth and future of the business.

Accelerating the transformation
Based on the foundation laid in 2018, we will accelerate the transformation in 2019. We are confident that the company has the right strategy and are building the capabilities to successfully transform the company and improve our profitability in the years to come.
In many ways A.P. Moller - Maersk is the enabler of global trade, as the world's largest and most reliable transportation network, connec ting suppliers and customers globally. Based on our strategy, we are leading the transformation of the industry, using digitalisation to make global supply chains more simple, transparent and efficient, thus making the access to global trade more accessible and less costly. A significant transformation which will not only impact our business, but also the world.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to extend our sincere gratitude to our leadership team and all our employees around the globe for their continued passion, efforts and dedication to transform our company. This loyalty and focus have built our unique position and is the foundation for our future.

Søren Skou CEO of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S

A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

The objective of the transformation of A.P. Moller - Maersk is to set the company on a new profitable growth trajectory. In the past two and a half years, we have come far in regaining our growth ambition, but we still need to improve profitability from the level seen in 2018.
We have transformed from being a cong lome rate, with a corporate layer overseeing independent, stand-alone business units that had their own bottom lines, to one company, with one bottom line and with customers at the centre of our attention. With the listing of Maersk Drilling, scheduled for 4 April 2019, we will have almost completed the separation of our energy-related businesses, totalling more than USD 12bn worth of separation transactions.
We have acquired and integrated Hamburg Süd, contributing towards industry consolid ation and positively impacting our results. We have made progress on the digital transformation of our business, digitising customer transactions, improving how we operate the business and our assets, and enabling new business opportunities.

We are transforming Maersk at a time, where our Ocean business has been challenged by weakening market fundamentals resulting in unsatisfactory financial results. We did not reach the earnings expectations we had at the beginning of the year, primarily due to the increase in bunker fuel prices having a negative impact during the first half of the year. Despite this, we have improved earnings and turned Maersk into a growth company again. Since 2016, we have added USD 12bn in revenue in the continuing businesses, a 43% increase, and have seen growth across all segments. In 2018 revenue grew 26% compared to the year before, and our net interest-bearing debt was significantly reduced.
United for growth
In 2018, the most profound step in our integration towards becoming one company was to simplify how our customers do business with us, by forming a new global frontline, which came into effect on 1 January 2019. We now have one sales team, one customer service team and one delivery organisation, covering our Ocean and Logistics & Services segments. By going to market in this way, we are taking steps to grow our non-Ocean activities and to better balance our business model.
We also took steps to integrate our support functions, such as IT/Technology, Finance, HR, Legal, Sustainability, Security and Corporate Communications, into global teams. By forming one team, as opposed to a separate team supporting each segment, these functions can provide more comprehensive services, while reducing costs.

In the first quarter of 2018, we changed our reporting structure to reflect that we are one company with one bottom line.
During 2017 and 2018, we realised more than USD 300m in savings by harvesting synergies across business segments mainly driven by closer collaboration between our Ocean segment and gateway terminals, further optimisation of our terminals and improved planning and utilisation of manufacturing capacity.
In December 2017, our acquisition of Hamburg Süd was approved, and during 2018 we consolidated both network and the operational organisations to deliver synergies, while maintaining two separate brands with two distinct value propositions for our customers. Aside from the benefits to the network, the acquisition has also enabled further utilisation of the terminals and benefits from joint procurement. Since the acquisition, we have realised USD 420m in synergies from Hamburg Süd and the expectation of synergies was therefore revised to a minimum of USD 500m by the end of 2019, from previously USD 350400m.
Improving customer experience online and offline
Maersk's technological landscape is also transforming to help improve the customer experience and make our operations more efficient.
For ocean transport, the transactions have been digitised, enabling customers to do everything online; getting a price quote, booking and documentation. For many years, we have had the ambition to make it as simple to book a

Directors' report Overview

container as it is to book an airline ticket. By enabling our customers to self-serve on multiple platforms, with 24/7 availability, we are well on our way to achieving this goal, and today, maersk.com is one of the largest business-to-business transaction sites in the world with more than 35,000 daily users and close to 20,000 bookings a day. We continuously focus on developing an even deeper understanding of our customers´ online journey, so that we can add new functionalities and products to the site.
In 2018, we improved the schedule reliability of our network putting Maersk and Hamburg Süd back in the top quartile of the industry, and the work to deliver better customer service leaves us with an all-time high customer satisfaction score in our Ocean segment. We have a continuous focus on improving the reliability of our network.
Strengthening the foundations in our terminals and manufacturing locations
The actions we have taken to strengthen our fundamentals in our terminals and manufacturing locations are also showing results.
Our gateway terminals delivered solid volume growth of 11%, which is almost three times faster than the market growth. While the majority of that growth was from closer collaboration with the Ocean segment, including Hamburg Süd, we also grew above the market with external customers. Hub productivity was up by 9.7% compared to 2017, which means that hub productivity has now overall risen by 23% since the launch of the strategy in 2016.

In 2018, Maersk Container Industry reshaped its factory footprint by exiting the dry container business and closing two of three factories. By doing this, the business will build on its core strength of refrigerated equipment and focus on meeting the expectations of customers with increasingly complex needs around temperature controlled transportation.
New safety approach
The well-being of our employees is a top priority for me personally and for our company. Seven people lost their lives while working for A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2018. These losses sadden me deeply. No one should go to work for A.P. Moller - Maersk and not come home. The loss of seven lives in 2018 only reinforces our resolve to strengthen our safety approach, so fatalities can be avoided.
To ensure that we get closer to our aim of zero fatalities, we are implementing a different approach to safety, and a new corporate safety organisation. Our new safety approach will address three critical priorities, including leaders hip accountability, creating capacity for safe operations, and one safety culture. We are building on the solid measures we already have in place and involving the teams that are most at risk, to identify and ensure the right preventive actions are in place, thereby mitiga ting even more risks.
2019 focus: Accelerating our journey
With Maersk as one of the driving forces, the industry has done an excellent job over the past 30 years in reducing costs and barriers of global trade. We are truly enabling exporters

to sell their products globally, and we are making it possible for importers to source parts or goods from the most competitive suppliers, no matter where they are in the world.
However, bringing cargo from one part of the world to another is still seen by our customers as a complex and unreliable process. We aim to deliver better reliability, more visibility and simplicity with our strategy: to become the global integrator of container logistics, connecting and simplifying our customers' supply chains. We will continue to leverage technology in the parts of the business that bring most value to the customer, and digital innovation remains key to offer customers a simple endto-end solution.
I want to express my sincere gratitude for the incredible focus and hard work that all 80,000 colleagues at Maersk are putting into this challenging transformation.
For 2019, the listing of Maersk Drilling on Nasdaq Copenhagen will be high on the agenda,

and I am confident that we will also find the right solution for Maersk Supply Service. At this stage, a warm thank you to all our colleagues in the energy businesses who have worked relentlessly under challenging circumstances and uncertainty on future perspective.
In 2019, we will continue to focus on improving results across the company while at the same time growing our Logistics & Services segment by expanding the product portfolio. We will continue our efforts to improve the customer experience across our products and pursue the technological transformation, and build on steps already taken to be one company with one culture. We will continue forging ahead, despite uncertainties in the current global macroeconomic outlook.
2018 was a year of execution to build the foundation for the new A.P. Moller - Maersk. 2019 will be the year of accelerating our transformation to set us up for long-term, profitable growth that will benefit all our customers and create shareholder value.

Financial review 2018
A.P. Moller - Maersk reported strong revenue growth and a successful integration of Hamburg Süd, realising synergies faster and higher than expected. However, the financial performance at the beginning of the year was lower than expected, mainly due to the increase in bunker costs not fully recovered by increase in freight rates, resulting in a lower result than set in the initial guidance for 2018.
The year showed a strong cash conversion and a positive free cash flow from continuing operations. Net interest-bearing debt was significantly reduced due to the proceeds from the completion of the Maersk Oil transaction and subsequent partial sale of shares in Total S.A. and a lower CAPEX reflecting capital discipline.

Financial and operational performance
A.P. Moller - Maersk reported an increase in revenue of 26% to USD 39.0bn (USD 30.9bn), with growth in all segments. Non-Ocean revenue amounted to 32% (35%) of total revenue. The lower share of non-Ocean revenue was driven by the acquisition of Hamburg Süd contributing to Ocean revenue.
In Ocean, revenue increased by 29% to USD 28.4bn (USD 22.0bn), mainly due to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd. Excluding Hamburg Süd, revenue increased by 5.8% to USD 22.7bn (USD 21.5bn), positively impacted by an increase in the average freight rate of 1.9% to 1,816 USD/FFE (1,782 USD/FFE), volume growth of 2.5% to 11,003k FFE (10,731k FFE), and a 13% increase in other revenue.

In Logistics & Services, revenue increased by 5.4% to USD 6.1bn (USD 5.8bn), supported by higher intermodal volumes in inland haulage, volume growth from supply chain management and revenue growth in warehousing activities.
Revenue grew by 8.4% to USD 3.8bn (USD 3.5bn) in Terminals & Towage, mainly driven by higher volumes in gateway terminals from Ocean by 19% and external customers by 7.3%.
EBITDA was USD 3.8bn (USD 3.5bn), in line with the latest guidance of USD 3.6-4.0bn, with an increase in Ocean to USD 3.0bn (USD 2.8bn), where the revenue increase was offset by a 32% increase in the average bunker price, equivalent to an additional cost of USD 1.2bn, not fully recovered in the freight rates. A Hamburg Süd pro forma EBITDA of USD 618m (pro forma USD 554m) made a positive contribution. EBITDA was negatively impacted by integration costs from Hamburg Süd of USD 60m, and restructuring costs of USD 50m from merging the commercial front lines of Ocean and Logistics & Services.

EBITDA in Terminals & Towage increased by 22% to USD 778m (USD 639m), and decreased in Logistics & Services to USD 98m (USD 139m), mainly due to restructuring costs and timing of maintenance costs in Star Air. For Manufacturing & Others, EBITDA declined to USD 59m (USD 173m).
Synergies related to the strategic integration of the transport, logistics and port businesses as well as the acquisition of Hamburg Süd have generally been realised as planned. For the integration of transport, logistics and port

Directors' report Overview

businesses, synergies of around USD 321m have been realised since the end of 2016. The synergy realisation is mainly reflected in the collaboration between Ocean and gateway terminals, with reported like-for-like volume growth in the financially consolidated gateway terminals of 10%, with the Ocean segment growing 19% compared to external customers growing 7.3%. The integration of Hamburg Süd delivered synergies of USD 420m in 2018, mostly realised within procurement, network optimisation and increased volumes in gateway terminals operated by Maersk.
EBITDA was negatively impacted by an estimated USD 0.2bn from changes in foreign exchange rate.
EBIT was USD 627m (USD 641m), positively impacted by the improvement in EBITDA in Ocean and Terminals & Towage, but negatively affected by increased depreciation due to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd. Furthermore, EBIT was negatively impacted by impairments of USD 206m in Maersk Container Industry, and from the share of profit/loss in associated companies affected by impairments of USD 190m in the RORO business in 2018, where

2017 was affected by an impairment of USD 265m impacting the share of profit/loss in APM Terminals´ joint ventures.
Financial expenses amounted to USD 389m (USD 616m), positively impacted by net foreign exchange rate developments and dividends from the Total S.A. shares of USD 238m, offset by higher net interest expenses due to higher average debt during the year.
Net profit including discontinued operations was USD 3.2bn (loss of USD 1.2bn), positively impacted by an accounting gain of USD 2.6bn from the closing of the Maersk Oil transaction in 2018 and an impairment in Maersk Drilling of USD 1.75bn in 2017. The result for the continuing operations was a loss of USD 148m (loss of USD 194m).
The underlying profit for continuing operations after financial items and tax was USD 220m (USD 356m), which is in line with the latest guidance for 2018 of a positive underlying result.
ROIC for continuing operations of 0.8% (1.6%) is at an unsatisfactory level, and below the target of minimum 8.5%.

New financial reporting structure
The financial reporting structure changed for 2018 with new segments to reflect the strateg ic initiatives taken towards becoming the global integrator of container logistics. In addition, new financial and operational metrics were introduced to facilitate transparent insight into the performance of the various business activities. The segments comprise:

Ocean With the activities of Maersk Liner Business (Maersk Line, Safmarine and Sealand ­ A Maersk Company) together with the Hamburg Süd brands (Hamburg Süd and Aliança) as well as strategic transshipment hubs under the APM Terminals brand. Inland activities related to Maersk Liner Business are included in the Logistics & Services segment.
Logistics & Services With the logistics and supply chain management services, container inland services, inland haulage activities (intermodal), trade finance services and freight forwarding.

Terminals & Towage Including gateway terminals, involving landside activities such as port activities where the customers are mainly the carriers, and towage services under the Svitzer brand.
Manufacturing & Others Maersk Container Industry's activities within reefer containers, following the decision in January 2019 to exit the dry container business altogether, and other businesses.

Discontinued operations reported a profit of USD 3.4bn (loss of USD 970m), reflecting the accounting gain of USD 2.6bn from the Maersk Oil transaction. The gain comprises the original gain calculated as of 30 June 2017 of USD 2.8bn less the profit recognised in the period from 1 July 2017 until closing 8March 2018 of USD 1.0bn, and the addition of locked box interest and the positive

Total S.A. share price development totalling USD 0.8bn. The result in 2017 was negatively impacted by impairment losses net of USD 2.2bn relating to Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Service.
Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Service reported a profit of USD 561m (loss of USD 1.8bn), positively impacted by the cessation of

depreciation from classification as discontinued operations, and a positive fair value adjustment in Maersk Drilling of USD 445m due to the improved market outlook and a negative fair value adjustment in Maersk Supply Service of USD 400m, while 2017 was negatively impacted by impairments of USD 2.2bn.
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 3.2bn (USD 3.1bn), equal to a cash conversion of 85% (88%) and driven by an increase in EBITDA of USD 274m, offset by the abolition of the export VAT scheme in Denmark, which had a negative one-off effect of USD 200m and higher tax paid, partly due to withholding tax on dividends received from the Total S.A. shares. Adjusted for the one-off related to the change in the VAT scheme, cash flow conversion would have been above 90%.

Gross capital expenditure (CAPEX) amounted to USD 2.9bn (USD 3.6bn), which is in line with the latest guidance for 2018 of around USD 3.0bn, mainly related to vessels ordered in previous years, containers in Ocean and development projects in Terminals & Towage. Free cash flow was USD 4.2bn (USD 1.3bn in 2017 excluding the acquisition of Hamburg Süd), positively impacted by the sale of Total S.A. shares of USD 3.0bn. Excluding the sale of the Total S.A. shares, the free cash flow was USD 1.2bn.
The contractual capital commitments for the continuing operations totalled USD 2.3bn (USD 3.9bn), of which USD 447m related to the newbuilding programme for vessels, etc. The remainder primarily relates to commitments towards terminal concession grantors.

Joint usage agreement with A.P. Møller Holding A/S

With the objective of further strengthening the value of the brands, A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S has entered into a joint usage agreement with A.P. Møller Holding A/S regarding the use of commonly used trademarks which historically have benefited both A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S and A.P. Møller Holding A/S.

A.P. Møller Holding A/S is the controlling shareholder of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S, and is wholly owned by A.P. Møller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney Møllers Fond til almene Formaal.
The joint usage agreement establishes a framework and a branding strategy for the commonly used trademarks and a joint brand board, where the parties can cooperate regarding the use of these trademarks.

A.P. Moller - Maersk reported an increase in revenue of 26% to USD 39.0bn (USD 30.9bn), with growth in all segments.
12 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

In total, USD 263m has been contractually committed for the installation of scrubbers and retrofitting on a selected part of the fleet as part of the plan to comply with the new sulphur regulations from January 2020. Continued CAPEX discipline remains a key focus area, with no new large vessel orders or new major terminal investments expected until at least 2020.
Capital structure and credit rating
Net interest-bearing debt for the continuing operations decreased to USD 8.7bn (USD 14.8bn), positively impacted by cash flow related to the cash proceeds of USD 2.0bn from the Maersk

Oil transaction in Q1 2018, the sale of USD 3.0bn of Total S.A. shares in Q3 and Q4 2018, cash proceeds from the separation of Maersk Drilling of USD 1.2bn in Q4 2018, and positive operating cash flow during the year, partly offset by gross investments and the payment of dividends and financial costs.
Maersk made net repayments of USD 5.5bn for the full year 2018 and repaid USD 5.1bn in Q4 2018. Net repayments of bonds amounted to USD 2.3bn, driven by free cash flow generation during the year, including cash flow from the sale of Total S.A. shares.

With an equity ratio of 59.0% (49.7%) and a liquidity reserve of USD 10.3bn (USD 9.6bn), Maersk maintains a strong financial position.

Maersk issued EUR 750m eight-year bonds in the euro market in March 2018, its first bond issue since 2016, and concurrently re-purchased a total notional amount of EUR 500m of its two outstanding EUR bonds maturing in 2019. Towards the end of the year, Maersk bought back the entirety of its USD bonds maturing in 2019 and 2020 with a total notional amount of USD 1.25bn, and parts of the EUR bonds maturing in 2019 and 2021 with a total notional amount of EUR 817m, or USD 925m.
Maersk's average maturity of debt was about four years (about four years), and gross debt has been reduced from USD 17.5bn to USD 11.9bn.
Total equity was USD 33.4bn (USD 31.4bn), positively impacted by the accounting gain of USD 2.6bn from the Maersk Oil transaction. With an equity ratio of 59.0% (49.7%), and a liquidity reserve of USD 10.3bn (USD 9.6bn), due to an increase in cash, Maersk maintains a strong financial position.
As part of the Maersk Oil transaction on 8March 2018, Maersk received 97.5 million

shares in Total S.A. with a value of USD 5.6bn. A total of 51.25 million Total S.A. shares, generating a cash flow of USD 3.0bn, were sold in 2018. At 31 December 2018, the Total S.A share price was EUR 46.2 per share, equal to a total value of the remaining 46.27 million shares of USD 2.4bn. The value adjustments are recognised in equity as other comprehensive income, while dividends are recognised in the income statement under financial items, net.
In 2019, Maersk has sold Total S.A. shares for an aggregated amount of approx. USD 1.0bn, and retains 27.9 million shares in Total S.A. with a current market value of approx. USD 1.6bn.
Maersk Drilling's separate financing has released cash proceeds of approx. USD 1.2bn to Maersk in Q4 2018.
Maersk remains investment grade-rated, and holds a Baa3 (stable) rating from Moody's after being downgraded in November, and a BBB (credit watch negative) for a possible downgrade rating from Standard & Poor's.

Maersk remains committed to maintaining its investment grade rating.
Subject to maintaining an investment grade rating, it is still expected that: · Maersk Drilling will be demerged via a
listing on 4 April 2019, where shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S will receive shares in Maersk Drilling · Following the demerger of Maersk Drilling, a material part of the value of the proceeds from the initially received Total S.A. shares will be distributed to the shareholders of A.P. Moller - Maersk in cash dividends and/ or share buy-backs.
Further details related to the capital structure of A.P. Moller - Maersk and the distribution of the proceeds from the received Total S.A. shares will be announced at the latest in connection with the Q2 Interim Report in August 2019.

Guidance for 2019

A.P. Moller - Maersk expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around USD 5.0bn when including the effects from IFRS 16, and around USD 4.0bn when excluding the effects from IFRS 16. From Q1 2019, guidance for EBITDA will be based on IFRS 16.
The organic volume growth in Ocean is exp ected to be in line with the estimated average market

growth of 1-3% for 2019. Guidance on gross capital expenditure (CAPEX) is around USD 2.2bn and a high cash conversion (cash flow from operations compared with EBITDA).
Maersk's guidance for 2019 is subject to con siderable uncertainties due to the current risk of further restrictions on global trade and other factors impacting container freight rates, bunker prices and foreign rate of exchange.

Sensitivities on guidance for 2019

The guidance of A.P. Moller - Maersk for 2019 depends on several factors. Based on the expected earnings level and all else being equal, the sensitivities for 2019 for four key assumptions are listed in the table below:

Implementing IFRS 16
(unaudited amounts)
The IFRS 16 accounting standard is effective from 1 January 2019 onwards. The new requirements in IFRS 16, entail that most leases recognise right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities, will have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

Implementation of IFRS 16 entails that almost all operating lease contracts will be recognised on the balance sheet. Operating leases for terminals, land, vessels, warehouses, buildings and other assets will be recognised on the balance sheet as right-ofuse assets and lease liabilities. In the income statement, lease costs will not be recognised as operating costs, but as depreciation of the right-of-use assets and interest cost on the lease liability.
A.P. Moller - Maersk has adopted IFRS 16 on 1January 2019 without reassessing the lease definition compared to that in the existing IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. Maersk has chosen to use the simplified (modified retrospective) approach with no restatement of comparative figures for prior periods.
A pro forma restatement of key figures for 2018 for Maersk and the segments is presented on page 16.

Impact on income statement and invested capital
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) will be significantly higher than under the current accounting standards as a significant part of expenses related to operating leases are no longer in cluded. For 2018, EBITDA increases by approx. USD 1.2bn to USD 5.0bn from USD 3.8bn.
Likewise, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) will increase, but to a lesser extent due to higher depreciation costs as the asset base has increased. Therefore, EBIT increases approx. to USD 0.8bn from USD 627m.
Net profit will decrease slightly due to increased financial expenses. In 2018, the net loss for continuing operations increases to approx. USD 0.3bn from a loss of USD 148m. Assets will in the future be recognised for the right-of-use received, and liabilities will be recognised for the payment obligations

entered for most leases. Adopting the new IFRS 16 accounting standard will not materially change the existing accounting rules for finance leases.

Therefore, total borrowings increase by approx. USD 6.0bn to USD 17.9bn. Invested capital also increases by approx. USD 6.0bn to USD 49bn.

Furthermore, Maersk will not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of lease contracts with a maturity shorter than 12 months, or leases of low-value assets. For dry containers, which individually are below the low-value assets threshold, Maersk has chosen a portfolio approach where contracts with multiple containers will be treated as one contract, and a right-of-use asset will be recognised.

Net interest-bearing debt increases by approx. USD 6.0bn from USD 8.7bn to USD 14.7bn.
Cash flow from operating activities will be impacted, as EBITDA increases due to the operating leases being reflected in higher interest costs, which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Therefore, cash flow from operating activities increases by approx. USD 1.2bn from USD 3.2bn to USD 4.4bn.

In container vessels, approx. 20% of its lease commitment matures within 12 months, thereby lowering the impact from IFRS 16. In hub and gateway terminals, most of the lease commitments (approx. 90%) are longterm concession agreements, which add approx. USD 2.2bn to the balance sheet.

Guidance for 2019
The guidance for 2019 is based on IFRS 16. From Q1 2019, the guidance will only be provided based on the new IFRS 16 accounting rules.

Market update
Growth in global container trade remained steady at 4.1% year-over-year in Q4 2018, and full-year 2018 growth ended at 3.7%, which was significantly weaker than the 5.6% recorded in 2017. Meanwhile, supply growth remained high at the beginning of the year, reflecting the many new vessels entering the market as well as the low levels of idling and the scrapping of older vessels, which led to declining freight rates in the first two quarters of 2018. Market fundamentals stabilised in the second half of 2018, as effective supply growth tapered off and freight rates began to increase, and industry profits picked up in Q3 2018 from subdued levels in the first half of 2018. Profits were negatively impacted by the increase in bunker costs, and which were not fully compensated for by increase in freight rates.

grew 3.9% in Q4, and 5.8% for 2018. Finally, intra-regional trades posted solid growth of 5.5% in Q4, and 4.9% for the year.
The moderation in container demand growth in 2018 mirrors the slowdown in global macroeconomics and global export orders (Chart 2). The main risk to global container demand relates to a further cyclical slowing of the global economy. Emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in the US dollar and to economic developments in the US via their financial leverage. Moreover, a further escalation of the international trade tensions carries a significant risk to global

trade. Finally, the outcome of the Brexit negotiations poses a risk to the UK's container trade.
Trade restrictions between the US and China sharply intensified in 2018, and the trade restrictive measures exposed nearly USD 440bn worth of traded goods in 2018, corresponding to around 2.6% of the global value of traded goods. During Q4 2018, the US administration decided to delay the increase of US tariffs on USD 200bn of Chinese import goods from 10% to 25% until March 2019, pending negotiations between the US and China. The negative effects on global trade from the trade restrictions remain to be

Market developments
East-West container trades grew by 2.6% in 2018 (Chart 1), as subdued trade flows in the first part of 2018 were counterbalanced by a growth acceleration to 4.5% in Q4 2018 compared to Q4 2017. The strong Q4 growth was driven by North American imports from the Far East of 10.8%, largely reflecting the front-loading of Chinese goods transport to the US in October and November to avoid the anticipated tariff rate increase on 1 January 2019, which was subsequently delayed. For 2018, North American imports from the Far East grew by 6.0%. European import growth from Asia remained moderate at 2.8% in Q4, in line with momentum in the European macro economy, bringing total growth on this trade to 1.9% for 2018. Meanwhile, Asian imports

from the US and Europe (East-West backhaul) declined in Q4 2018, largely because of the restrictions imposed by China on waste and scrap material imports, which kept volumes low for most of 2018, and led to a decrease of 1.7% for the full year of 2018. North-South container trades slowed to 2.3% growth in Q4, substantially lower than for the full year of 2018 with a growth of 3.9%. Latin American import growth had been strong in the first part of 2018, but a decline of 1.4% in Q4 was the main drag on North-South container trades. Growth of 3.4% for the full year reflected a closer alignment to domestic demand developments. Moreover, import growth in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent grew by only 1.7% in Q4, bringing total growth to 2.1% for 2018, while African imports

seen, but the combined effect of all trade restrictions introduced during 2018 is estimated to reduce global container trade growth by 0.3-1.0 percentage points per year in 2019-2020 if US tariffs are increased to 25% in March 2019, and by 0.2-0.5 percentage points per year if tariffs instead remain at current levels.
The global container fleet stood at 22m TEU at the end of 2018, 5.8% higher than at the end of 2017 (Chart 3). Deliveries amounted to 1,300k TEU (165 vessels) in 2018, with most deliveries occurring at the beginning of the year and only 184k TEU during Q4. Deliveries were dominated by vessels larger than

10k TEU. Hardly any vessels were scrapped in the first three quarters of 2018, but in Q4, 35 vessels were scrapped, bringing the total to 66 vessels in 2018, corresponding to 111k TEU. The low rate of scrapping in 2018 was linked to the small number of idled vessels, which in turn reflects the tight market for vessels below 7.5k TEU, which also supported time charter rates.
New vessel orders amounted to a decent 1,297k TEU in 2018 (215 vessels), probably reflecting the solid demand seen in recent years, and the very low amount of new orders in 2016 and 2017 of 292k TEU and 671k TEU, respectively. However, the level of new orders

was very low in Q4 2018, at only 59k TEU, and the overall orderbook-to-fleet ratio remains relatively low at around 12%, well below GNloombainlaclocnatpaainceitrydemand the 2013-2017 average of 18%. According to Alphaliner, this means that the nominal global container fleet is set to grow by 4.0% in 2019.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has decided to implement a 0.5% sulphur cap on marine fuel from 2020 (IMO 2020). While the consequences for container vessel supply are difficult to forecast, it could very well lead to the retrofitting of a significant part of the global fleet during a three-to-five-year period beginning in the later part of 2019. Together with incentives to reduce vessel

speed, this would likely reduce effective supply, potentially by up to 2.5% by 2021. Moreover, the spread between bunker and crudeoil fuel types could widen sharply, as early as from Q4 2019.
Freight rates, as measured by the China Composite Freight Index (CCFI), declined slightly by 1.0% in 2018, reflecting the substantial number of new vessels entering the market, mainly in the first part of the year (Chart 4). However, freight rates were 9.3% higher in Q4 2018 compared to Q4 2017, as only a few vessel deliveries came to the market, the number of idled vessels increased, and due to the extra demand growth on the Pacific trades

following the front-loading of US imports from China. Freight rates rose by 32% in Q4 on the Asia to West Coast US trade. Rates were stable on the Asia to North Europe trade, with an increase of 0.5%, while Asia to Mediterranean Europe trade increased by 14%. Uncertainties relating to the strength of container demand in 2019 pose a downside risk to freight rates in general, while uncertainties about supply, particularly relating to the impact of IMO 2020 sulphur regulations, present an upside.
Time charter rates rose sharply in 2018 and peaked during the summer, reflecting a shortage of small and medium-size vessels,

as noted earlier. More recently, time charter rates have come down on the back of the more moderate fundamentals. In Q4 2018, time charter rates declined by 12% compared to Q3 2018, but remained elevated. Clarksons´ time charter rate index increased by 8.8% compared to Q4 2017, down from a growth rate of 38% in Q2 2018.
Rotterdam bunker prices increased 31% in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a steady increase during Q1 to Q3 2018 followed by a decrease in Q4 of 6.0% compared to Q3 2018. Nevertheless, Q4 2018 bunker prices remained 19% higher than in Q4 2017. Forward markets indicate that bunker prices will decline by 4%

in Q1 2019 compared to Q4 2018. Thereafter, forward markets project a further 13% decline in bunker prices by Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018. The anticipated decline is driven by a weaker outlook for crude oil prices and a wider bunker-crude oil spread, reflecting the market's view of the impact of the IMO 2020 sulphur regulations on demand for high sulphur bunker fuels.
The US dollar was on average 1.9% stronger against the euro in Q4 2018 compared to Q3 2018. The US dollar has on average been 4.5% weaker in 2018 than in 2017 (Chart 5).

The growth outlook for global container trade is projected to deteriorate further to 1-3% in 2019.

Directors' report Overview

Historic transformation of A.P. Moller - Maersk Maersk at a glance Message from the Chairman Message from the CEO Financial review 2018 Guidance for 2019 Implementing IFRS 16 Five-year summary Market update

The other transport and logistics markets, outside the ocean industry, were in broad terms impacted by the dynamics and market drivers that also steered the ocean industry. However, in the container port industry, structural challenges from the cascading of large container vessels, reinforced carrier alliances and increased point-to-point services combined with ongoing capacity increases in many ports continue to weigh on the industry. The increased load on the terminals is triggering requirements for upgrades of the terminal infrastructure, equipment, manning and planning capabilities, leading to more capital expenditure and operational cost, but lower utilisation. At the same time, carriers are looking for ways in which to reduce their terminal costs, which have become the biggest single cost item.
Solid growth in global trade volumes in 2017 and 2018 has supported the broader logistics segment. However, there is variation across the segment. Gross margins in the freight forwarding market remain under structural pressure from digital offerings. Freight forwarders are attempting to mitigate these pressures by selling value-added services on top of basic freight forwarding products and by developing their own digital offerings to be competitive against new entrants. Contract logistics, a fragmented market, has seen solid demand for fulfilment activities from the booming e-commerce segment. Supply chain management also grew robustly with a few focused players increasing value added services through digitalised offerings.
21 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Structural outlook for global trade

The world economy is experiencing structural changes that could affect the outlook for global trade over the next 10-20 years.
The rapid rise of Global Value Chains (GVCs) has been an important driver of global trade growth, but emerging evidence suggests that the international fragmentation of production has lost momentum. For instance, the global container trade to GDP multiplier has declined to around 1.2 (see chart below).
The reasons are manifold, but can be grouped into two broad categories: 1. factors that supported GVC expansion which are now
declining, and 2. new factors that are negatively impacting GVCs.
For example, rising wage costs in some emerging economies and the digitalisation of production could restore

the competitiveness of mature economies, thereby discouraging further offshoring while encouraging the reshoring or nearshoring of production. Alongside the hidden costs of lengthy supply chains (including the costs of protecting proprietary knowledge), the need to balance cost efficiency with risk diversification (including rising barriers to trade) and the cost of internalising the environmental impact of international transport may increase the effective cost of international trade. If these trends persist, they will re-shape the future evolution of GVCs.
Estimating the impact of these trends on global trade patterns is complex and subject to significant uncertainties. The OECD has simulated how GVCs may evolve under different scenarios. This foresight exercise suggests that global trading patterns could change materially over the coming decades, and under certain assumptions could see global trade struggling to increase its current share of global output.

It is worth noting that even under these circumstances, global container volumes would increase by 18-23m FFEs over the next 10 years (assuming low global GDP growth of 2.0-2.5% per annum). This is equivalent to a new Maersk Line and Hamburg Süd entering the container market. In addition, the container industry is engaged with counteracting the above trends by radically reducing the complexity and effective cost of container trade by offering end-to-end integrated container services and reducing the environmental footprint of international trade. Not only will this positively affect the economics and robustness of GVCs, it will make international markets more accessible to small and medium- sized companies across the world. Maersk is at the forefront of these initiatives. The strategy section of this report explains the specific actions that are being taken to enable the growth of international trade and to increase the future resilience of the business model.

Strategy
A.P. Moller - Maersk is in the process of transforming itself from being a conglomerate to becoming the global integrator of container logistics, providing customers with end-to-end supply chain solutions. Significant steps have been taken on this journey already, including the integration of the Transport & Logistics businesses and Hamburg Süd, the successful separation of Maersk Oil and Maersk Tankers, as well as the announcement of Maersk Drilling's separate listing in 2019. Efforts are continually being made to find the best solution for Maersk Supply Service, although the timing is difficult to predict.

segment. The guidance of being able to realise up to USD 600m in synergies, both operational and commercial, is maintained. The synergies were expected to be realised by 2019. However, the fact that commercial synergies are being kick-started in 2019, the full synergies are now expected to be realised in 2020.

The integration of Hamburg Süd is pro gressing ahead of plan, showing progress in network optimisation, synergies with APM Terminals and procurement, with realised synergies at a level of around USD 420m in 2018. Synergy expectations were revised up to a minimum of USD 500m by the end of 2019, from initially USD 350-400m.

Realised and expected synergies from the integration of Hamburg Süd, USD million

Considerable progress in building the new Maersk as one integrated container logistics company has already been made in several key areas, including the integration of Hamburg Süd, delivering synergies, improved customer satisfaction, as well as important steps in the digitisation journey. Moreover, changes to the Ocean and Logistics & Services organisations have been introduced with the One Maersk initiative, joining the front lines of the two, which came into effect on 1 January 2019. A transformation of this magnitude takes time, and Maersk is continuously working on and tracking the progress of the transformation.
Delivering synergies
A total of more than USD 300m in synergies from the integration of existing businesses has been realised in 2017 and 2018.

These mainly comprise operational synergies from increased collaboration between the container shipping and terminal businesses, thus increasing utilisation in the terminals, as well as joint production planning between the Ocean and Manufacturing & Others segments. Furthermore, both commercial and cost synergies from increased collaboration within the Terminals & Towage segment are expected.
The commercial synergies have yet to be delivered, and the merging of the Ocean and Logistics & Services front lines as of 1 January 2019 will kick-start the delivery of these synergies, focusing on selling endto-end supply chain solutions to customers, while Damco freight forwarding will remain as a separate entity in the Logistics & Services

Customer experience and the digitisation journeys
It should be as easy to ship a container across the world as it is for costumers to send a parcel, which, however, is not the case today. Changing the way in which container logistics is currently handled and leading the way in the digitisation of the industry are important steps towards this transformation, and holds considerable potential for improving the customer experience.

Digitisation of various parts of the business model plays a vital role in this, and will benefit customers in terms of ease of use and user-friendliness. Considerable progress on the digitisation of the customer experience has already been taken, for instance quote automation, Self-Service Instant Booking (SSIB), an online self-service platform, moving sales online, Remote Container Management (RCM), and digitising the paper trails related to moving a container, to name a few. Additionally, the One Maersk initiative will

integrate the customer experience across multiple products, increase the number of products and services available online, and provide customers with increasing visibility and actionability on their shipments.
Twill, a multicarrier platform, constitutes the digital effort to bring the full end-to-end supply chain solution online, where customers can book, manage and monitor their shipments with the click of a button. Significant growth was realised in 2018 on the Twill platform as

volumes more than quadrupled. Twill is currently active in 27 countries, with two more countries coming online at the beginning of 2019.
TradeLens, which provides the necessary infrastructure for sharing documents across the supply chain, and thereby reducing complexity for the customer as well as for suppliers, is an example of another project that is contributing to the process of disposing of many of the underlying manual and paperbased processes in the container logistics

industry. Moreover, Maersk is increasing its digitisation of assets, as exemplified by RCM, as well as by experimenting with the increased traceability of dry cargo.
Maersk strives to put the customer in the centre, and has taken significant steps to improve the customer experience in 2018. Schedule reliability perfomance has improved, placing Maersk Line and Hamburg Süd back in the top quartile in the industry. Continuous efforts are being made to improve reliability. Moreover, improving invoice quality and issue resolution has been high on the agenda in 2018, and considerable progress has been made as customer satisfaction, as measured

by the Net Promoter Score, increased to an all-time high in 2018. Despite the progress on customer satisfaction, there is still room for improvement, and therefore Maersk will relentlessly pursue the continuous improvement of the customer experience to realise its ambition of making shipping a container as easy as shipping a parcel across the world.
Tracking the transformation
Maersk is transforming from a conglomerate into becoming one integrated container logistics company, working to achieve a more balanced split of revenue as well as earnings. The ambition for 2023 is to balance the earnings level between the Ocean and non-Ocean

Key metrics to track the transformation

segments. Four key metrics have been defined for tracking the transformation in a structured manner, showing the progress externally.
As part of becoming the global integrator of container logistics, focus on growing the nonOcean business is vital, so revenue growth in non-Ocean will be pursued. This will reduce the dependency on freight rates and increase growth in higher and more stable margin business. Terminals & Towage, part of the non-Ocean segment, currently provides a steadier cash flow than the Ocean segment, and will continue to optimise the portfolio and improve profitability.
With increasing focus on servicing customers with end-to-end supply chain solutions worldwide, growth in Logistics & Services' gross profit is being targeted, although, organic growth alone will not generate sufficient growth to realise the 2023 ambitions. Hence,

inorganic growth may be required in the form of bolt-on acquisitions to build the capabilities needed in various parts of the Logistics & Services segment and to harvest synergies across the supply chain.
Finally, the strategic plan will be pursued while exercising strict capital discipline, and Maersk has committed to no new large vessels being ordered until at least 2020 as well as no new large terminal projects, while new dry containers will increasingly be leased rather than bought. Focus will thus be on less capital-intensive growth, and on the ability to generate free cash flow to ensure returns to shareholders and investments to support the strategic direction. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, the long-term target for return on invested capital (ROIC) is above 7.5%.

Risk management
Transforming A.P. Moller - Maersk to become the global integrator of container logistics is a complex process which carries multiple risks. It is essential that risks associated with the transformation, and risks inherent to the business activities are managed effectively to keep the potential financial and reputational impact of such risks within acceptable levels.

summarises the status in quarterly reports to the Executive Board. Where the progress of mitigating actions is falling behind schedule, or where mitigating actions are not achieving the effect they were designed to have, the report will highlight this so that corrective action can be taken.

The latest risk assessment was carried out in the second half of 2018, and identified nine key risks that may have a significant impact on the business plan, including on earnings, financial position, and the achievement of other strategic objectives.

A.P. Moller - Maersk risk management process

Effective risk management is key to growing sustainably in an increasingly volatile and uncertain business environment. Several initiatives have been launched to further strengthen the risk management process e.g. by improving board and management oversight and by driving accountability for the management of key risks.
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing risk management. The Board of Directors determines the framework for managing risks, including risk appetite. The Audit Committee monitors the execution of the risk management processes and the management of key risks. The Executive Board is responsible for overseeing day-today risk management.

Risk management process
Each year, the Executive Board establishes the key risks to the business plan. In preparation for the discussions in the Executive Board, a comprehensive risk assessment takes place. The Executive Board appoints a risk owner (an Executive Board member) for each key risk to oversee the management of the risk, including the preparation and execution of mitigation action plans. Once the plans for the management of the risks have been finalised, the risk owner presents and discusses such plans with the Executive Board and the Audit Committee in designated deep dive risk sessions.
The risk management function monitors the status of each key risk, including the progress and effect of the mitigation action plans, and

Key risk analysis for 2019
The key risks to realising the 2019-2023 business plan and the mitigation activities deployed are described in the following.
Business transformation The risk is that the transformation of A.P. Moller - Maersk into a growth company supported by a digital business model with an integrated end-to-end (E2E) product offering does not materialise as envisaged due to a lack of business agility to anticipate and respond to the external developments and internal challenges.
To support and coordinate the business transformation in the next coming years several teams and new processes across the organisation have been established to drive the transformation.
IMO 2020 Currently, there are no compliant low-cost fuels that fulfil the global Sulphur regulation (IMO 2020) requirements coming into force from 2020. The existing compliant fuels, as well as new fuels being developed, are expected to cost substantially more than current High Sulphur Fuel Oil bunkers, implying substantial fuel cost increases in 2020. Installing scrubbers on vessels will enable today's lower cost fuels to be used, but will, on the other hand, require substantial capital expenditure. The risk is that the increased costs relating to the implementation of and compliance with the IMO 2020 requirements cannot be recovered from customers.

Multiple commercial and operational mitigating initiatives are being pursued.
Cyber security As Maersk becomes increasingly digitalised, more devices and control systems are connected online, resulting in a bigger interface across the IT infrastructure that could be compromised. A successful cyber-attack within this wider attack surface could result in major operational disruption and/or data breaches leading to major financial loss.
It is a strategic priority to continue to improve cyber security through the cyber security plan that was launched after the cyber-attack in 2017.
Freight rates The risk is that freight rates collapse because of global trade deceleration and a resulting structural decline in demand for containerised transportation. Also, that new export orders in the US, EU and China slow down because of e.g. lower GDP and trade wars.
While Maersk is relatively well positioned to deal with the risk, it remains highly exposed to freight rates until a more diversified and balanced business has been established through expansion of the non-ocean activities. Having limited leverage over the overall demand for container shipping the key factors to mitigate risk from development in freight rates are to diversify the activities into logistics and maintain industry cost leadership.

28 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Each year, the Executive Board identifies the key risks to the business plan. In preparation for the discussions in the Executive Board, a comprehensive risk assessment takes place.

Capital structure One of the strategic priorities is to grow Logistics & Services organically and inorganically (i.e. through M&A activities). There is a risk that Maersk will not be able to do so due to a lack of available funds and increasing cost of capital.
Maersk remains committed to separating the energy businesses and maintaining an investment grade rating. That includes initiatives to stabilise and improve the level of earnings and effective capital discipline.

Technology transformation Maersk's transformation implies having a vision to connect and simplify customers' supply chains. There is a risk that Maersk will not achieve its vision due to misalignment between the transformation strategy of the Technology organisation and Maersk's business transformation strategy.
Mitigation includes upskilling of the Tech nology organisation.

Directors' report The A.P. Moller - Maersk business

Business model disruption The risk entails that Maersk loses the customer relation due to its inability to secure a digitally based competitive advantage in Liner operations and logistics; and/or value chain re-configuration in transport and logistics away from Liner-to-Beneficiary Cargo Owner contact.

Follow-up on 2018 risks
During the year, the focus has been on successfully mitigating the risks associated with the Hamburg Süd integration, improving schedule reliability and the customer experience and protecting the quality of the Maersk balance sheet in times of transformation.

Maersk is transforming its business model to become truly customer-centric and digital and through that create simplified E2E offerings, provide a superior delivery network and ensure seamless customer engagement.
New Maersk product A.P. Moller - Maersk is creating one commercial organisation to grow Logistics & Services and expand its product offering to customers. The risk is that customers are not willing to buy more products from Maersk, or that Maersk is unable to sell more products to customers, resulting in a failure to grow the business as planned.
A.P. Moller - Maersk has established one integrated commercial team across Ocean and Logistics & Services.
Human Resources A.P. Moller - Maersk might fail to successfully deliver on its transformation objectives due to the lack of functional capabilities and behaviours required to transform the businesses and to deliver on the new strategy. The risk is mainly related to logistics, digital and the creation of 'One Maersk'.

The integration of Hamburg Süd is progressing according to plan, and with synergies above expectations. The Net Promoter Score improvements are evidencing higher customer satisfaction, and the gross and net debt levels have been reduced significantly, while A.P. Moller - Maersk remains an investment grade-rated company.
Business portfolio risks
The business portfolio is increasingly exposed to fluctuations in freight rates following the separation of the energy businesses and the addition of Hamburg Süd. The Ocean segment remains the biggest marginal earnings volatility contributor, and completing the separation of the energy businesses will increase the effect even further. It remains a strategic priority for Maersk to reduce its dependency on freight rates and to grow adjacent businesses to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility.

A.P. Moller - Maersk has intensified the investments in employee capability and engagement.

Hamburg Süd and Maersk Line have successfully managed to form one team with a bigger and improved network offering for customers.

Ocean
Ocean reported an increase in revenue of 29% to USD 28.4bn (USD 22.0bn) with volume growth of 22% (2.5% excluding Hamburg Süd). The average bunker price increased by 32%, equal to 92 USD/FFE, while the average freight rate increased by 5.1% (1.9% or 34 USD/FFE excluding the Hamburg Süd rate impact). Unit cost at fixed bunker was 3.6% higher than in 2017, partly because of the effects of Hamburg Süd´s portf olio mix and negative foreign exchange rate developments. EBITDA was USD 3.0bn (USD 2.8bn).
In the first half of 2018, bunker prices increased, the US dollar was weak and there was a high imbalance between supply and demand, mainly due to a high number of new deliveries and a limited number of scrappings. The freight rate development did not follow the increasing bunker price, and Maersk implemented an emergency bunker surcharge during the second half of 2018. The freight rates recovered slightly along with a better balance between supply and demand in the second half of the year.
The integration of Hamburg Süd delivered synergies of USD 420m in 2018, which were mostly realised within procurement, network optimisation and increased volumes in gateway terminals operated by Maersk.

Directors' report Performance 2018

Financial and operational performance
Revenue increased by 29% to USD 28.4bn (USD 22.0bn), driven by a 22% increase in volumes to 13,306k FFE (10,939k FFE), an average freight rate increase of 5.1% to 1,879 USD/ FFE (1,788 USD/FFE) as well as increases in other revenue, mainly due to demurrage and detention. The volume increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of Hamburg Süd, which also contributed positively to the increase in freight rates and other revenue, mainly because of demurrage and detention.
North-South and Intra-regional trades accounted for most of the increase in

volumes, largely because of Hamburg Süd's position in these markets. Headhaul volume grew 20% and backhaul increased 24%, mainly due to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd. The volume growth excluding Hamburg Süd of 2.5% was driven by headhaul growth of 2.5% and backhaul growth of 2.6%. Due to a profitability focus including a capacity target of around 4m TEU in the second half of the year, the full-year volume growth of 2.5%, excluding Hamburg Süd, was lower than the estimated market growth of around 3.5-4.0%. The overweight presence on North-South and Asia-Europe, which had a lower growth than the Asia-US and Intra-Asia growth, partly made the overall growth lower than

Unit cost at fixed bunker price was 3.6% above 2017, partly due to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd, which has a different portfolio mix to Maersk Line. Unit cost at fixed bunker price has been negatively affected by a weaker US dollar, along with the inclusion of Hamburg Süd in 2018. Compared to a 2017 pro forma unit cost at fixed bunker, the unit cost at fixed bunker increased by 0.5% adjusted for a negative foreign rate of exchange impact.

New guidelines on the stowage of dangerous cargo were implemented on the back of the devastating fire in one of the cargo holds on the container vessel Maersk Honam. The fire was a seminal event for Maersk, after five colleagues sadly lost their lives. A study of the fire showed that all international regulations and requirements were adhered to, hence new guidelines and procedures for dangerous goods stowage were needed to mitigate the inadequacy of the rules. A further review of all international regulations and requirements covering the carriage and stowage of dangerous goods is currently taking place together with industry partners, and the results will be presented to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to implement best management practices in the indusUtnryitrceogsatrding dangerous cargo.
Different initiatives were implemented during 2018 to improve the customer experience, e.g. by reducing the complexity of shipping a container. As an example, the introduction of the instant booking confirmation allows customers to complete bookings within seconds. This is an improvement from previous procedures with waiting times of up to two hours. The initiatives have had a positive effect on customer satisfaction, which has improved from quarter to quarter throughout the year. Furthermore, the next steps towards improving the customer experience and becoming

the global integrator of container logistics were announced in September by bringing the commercial organisations of Maersk Line and Damco supply chain services together to serve customers as One Maersk, starting 1 January 2019.
It was further announced that Maersk aims to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and will initiate an open and collaborative dialogue with all possible parties to tackle the climate changes together. Amongst others, this involves new carbon-neutral vessels, which are due to be commercially ready by 2030.
By January 2020, the new global low sulphur bunker fuel regulations (IMO 2020) will come into force. To prepare for this, a total of USD 263m has been contractually committed for investing in scrubbers and retrofitting to be installed on selected vessels. Scrubbers form one element of the Maersk 2020 fuel sourcing strategy, while most of the fleet will rely on compliant low sulphur fuels when the regulation starts. To cover the estimated extra fuel costs, which could exceed USD 2bn per year following the new bunker regulations, a new Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF) was announced. This is designed to balance fluctuations in fuel costs while also enabling customers to predict, plan and track how changes in fuel prices impact their total freight rates.

Status first year integration of Hamburg Süd

Hamburg Süd and Maersk Line joined forces on 1 December 2017, and the two companies have successfully managed to form one team, with a bigger and improved network offering to customers, amongst others by sharing best practices, resources and strengths. The benefit of the model of keeping Hamburg Süd as a commercially independent company has been seen in the high customer retention and high customer satisfaction rates.
In the first year, the integration progressed better than initially planned with total synergies of USD 420m in 2018. The synergies were slightly higher than the latest upgraded guidance from Q3 2018 of up to USD 400m. The synergies have been realised mostly

within procurement, network optimisation and increased volumes in gateway terminals operated by Maersk. Additionally, customer retention has been better than planned, and further synergies are expected in 2019. Total synergies are expected to amount to minimum USD 500m by 2019, excluding integration costs.
Hamburg Süd contributed with volumes of 2,303k FFE in 2018 (pro forma 2,343k in 2017) and pro forma EBITDA of USD 618m (pro forma USD 554m), adjusted for internal slot charter following the transfer of vessels and equipment from Hamburg Süd to the wider Ocean network. The total integration cost was USD 60m in 2018, in line with the guidance of less than USD 100m.

Volumes increased by 22% to 13,306k FFE (10,939k FFE) in 2018, mainly due to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd. The average freight rate increased by 5.1% to 1,879 USD/FFE (1,788 USD/FFE), positively affected by Hamburg Süd's different trade mix and a tighter supply and demand in the second half of 2018 along with the introduction of the emergency bunker surcharge. Unit cost at floating bunker was 7.9% above 2017, mainly driven by a 32% increase in the average bunker price. The freight rate increases did not absorb the increased bunker prices.

due to a change in the portfolio mix following the inclusion of Hamburg Süd and negative rate of exchange effects of 0.6%. Compared to an estimated pro forma 2017 unit cost at fixed bunker of 1,794 USD/FFE, had Hamburg Süd been part of Maersk since 1 January 2017, the unit cost at fixed bunker would have increased by 0.5% adjusted for negative rate of exchange effects. The main drivers of the increase were an unsatisfactorily high unit cost in Q1 2018 and low organic volume growth in the second half of 2018 driven by a focus on margin improvement.
Total unit cost at 2,015 USD/FFE (1,867 USD/ FFE) was 7.9% higher than in 2017, negatively impacted by a 32% increase in the average

bunker price or 92 USD/FFE. Bunker price volatility was significant in 2018, with high sulphur fuel in Rotterdam at around 360 USD/tonne in Q1, peaking at around 480 USD/tonne in October and closing the year at around 310 USD/tonne. Due to the drop in bunker price at the end of the year, it was decided to discontinue the emergency bunker surcharge on most trades, while being phased out gradually on the remaining trades towards the end of Q1 2019. Overall, the higher bunker prices, along with the higher consumption due to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd's volumes, resulted in a total bunker cost increase of 51% to USD 5.0bn (USD 3.3bn) compared to 2017. Out of the total increase of USD 1.7bn, USD 1.2bn was

was 19% higher than in 2017, mainly due to the inclusion of the Hamburg Süd fleet. The fleet ended the year at 4,009k TEU, and was in line with the target of around 4m TEU, which continues into 2019. Idle capacity was 78k TEU (five vessels) at the end of 2018, compared to 31k TEU (four vessels) at the end of 2017. The idle capacity corresponds to approx. 14% of the total idle capacity in the market. Five Baltic Feeder vessels, four 14k TEU vessels

and five 19k TEU vessels were delivered in 2018. No deliveries took place in Q4, as a Baltic Feeder vessel delivery was postponed into Q1 2019. Two Baltic Feeder vessels, three 14k TEU vessels and one 19k TEU vessel remain to be delivered by Q2 2019. The new vessels will replace older and less efficient vessels. One vessel was scrapped in 2018. No new orders of large vessels will be made before 2020, at the earliest.

due to the higher average bunker price, while the remaining increase was due to higher consumption from the inclusion of volumes from Hamburg Süd, partly offset by a 5.9% improvement in bunker efficiency per loaded FFE of 894 kg/FFE (950 kg/FFE). The bunker efficiency, measured in bunker fuel grams/ TEU times nautical mile, of 44.2 was an imp rovement of 2.9% compared to 2017. The previously announced new Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF) is expected to cover fluctuations in the bunker prices from 1 January 2019 for volumes shipped on long-term contracts.
The number of port moves per hour in hub terminals was 80.6, which was 9.7% better than in 2017. Throughout the year, steady improvements were made to increase efficiency, mainly on the back of operational synergies between the hub terminals and Maersk Liner Business and efficiency initiatives that gradually materialised. Rotterdam and Maasvlakte II in the Netherlands improved the most compared to 2017.

EBITDA was USD 3.0bn (USD 2.8bn), with a full-year contribution from Hamburg Süd compared to one month in 2017; however, the cyber-attack affected performance in 2017. The EBITDA margin of 10.6% was 2.0 percentage points below 2017, mainly because the increase in bunker prices was not compensated for in the freight rates. Additionally, the bunker price increase along with the inclusion of Hamburg Süd changed the cost base split compared to 2017. Container handling and equipment increased slightly to 40% of the total cost base (39%), while improvements in network costs decreased their contribution from 34% in 2017 to 30% in 2018. Bunker cost increased by 2.4 percentage points to 19% of the total cost base, while non-operational costs including SG&A were unchanged at 11%.
The fleet consisted of 355 own vessels and 355 chartered vessels at the end of 2018. The average nominal capacity continued to decrease throughout the year, ending at an average of 4,115k TEU for the full year, which

Key initiatives in 2018

During the year, Twill has changed its brand affiliation from Damco to Maersk, which will make it possible to offer Twill to all customers, in line with the strategy of becoming a global integrator of container logistics offering end-to-end solutions. Furthermore, Twill was rolled out in 27 countries with instant quote availability on all portport trade lanes within these countries. The first door-to-door bookings were made in Q4 on the Twill online platform. Customer retention remains very high at around 80%, with more and more customers signing up for Twill directly via the online channels.

The new facility supports the commitment to servicing growing customer demand for last mile logistics space in the Los Angeles market.
Inland activities continued to expand the business across Latin America, Africa and Europe, including a new cold chain facility in India and a dedicated block train connection in Chile.
For intermodal, several new corridors were added throughout the year to the most important inland markets in Africa, India and China to unlock the inland growth potential in these markets.

For Logistics & Services, significant new customer wins were secured throughout the year due to intensified and focused solution sales activities. To cater for the additional business, the warehousing and distribution footprint was expanded significantly with the addition of a six-building logistics campus within the Los Angeles industrial market.

Logistics & Services will further improve collaboration with customers via the accelerated co-develop ment of solutions and lead digital innovations, in cluding Twill, offering simple shipping to small and medium-sized companies. This will be further reinforced by merging Logistics & Services' and Ocean's commercial organisations as of 1January 2019.

Intermodal revenue increased by 7.6% to USD 2.6bn (USD 2.4bn), driven by higher volumes in India and Africa and by higher volumes and rates in European and Latin American markets. Gross profit increased to USD 46m (USD 39m), driven by portfolio expansion in line with the strategy. During 2018, there were also contingencies in Europe, mainly in the UK, and trucking strikes in Brazil, which adversely affected costs.
Ocean freight forwarding revenue was USD 646m (USD 666m) due to a volume decrease of 3.8% to 639k TEU (664k TEU); however, gross profit increased to USD 115m (USD 109m) due to improved margins. Margins grew by 9.8% to 180 USD/TEU (164 USD/TEU), supported by improved pricing and procurement.

Airfreight forwarding revenue was USD 608m (USD 659m) with volumes at 176k tonnes (206k tonnes), mostly due to an on going customer deselection process and an overall slow-down of the airfreight market, not least in China. Gross profit increased to USD 70m (USD 68m), reflecting higher margins. Margins increased by 20% to 396 USD/ tonne (331 USD/tonne).
EBIT conversion ratio of 6.1% (14.5%) de- creased mainly due to restructuring costs in Damco, the timing of maintenance costs in Star Air, and lower profitability in inland activities. The lower profitability in inland services was mainly driven by 2017 being positively impacted by the divestment of Pentalver with a gain of USD 35m, and higher operational costs. Star Air was negatively impacted by the timing of maintenance costs. The EBIT conversion ratio for 2018 of 6.1% is unsatisfactory.

Terminals & Towage
Terminals & Towage reported an increase in revenue of 8.4% to USD 3.8bn (USD 3.5bn), and an increase in EBITDA of 22% to USD 778m (USD 639m). The results in gateway terminals were driven by higher volumes from Ocean and external customers as well as cost per move reductions. Higher volumes in towage were due to increased activities in the Americas and Australia.
In Terminals, the closer collaboration with Ocean and the 19% growth in volumes from Maersk Line and Hamburg Süd were further supported by 7.3% volume growth from external customers, positively impacted by a net of 15 new contracts won. For Towage, activity increased in the Americas, in both Argentina and Brazil, driven by new customers in ports entered during 2018, and additional volumes and market share in the ports entered in 2017. In Australia, volumes improved due to higher commodity exports and improved market share for harbour towage.
Terminals & Towage reduced CAPEX in 2018. Gateway reduced CAPEX by USD 200m of which USD 146m was from increased capital discipline and USD 54m from lower CAPEX in terminals under construction. CAPEX in Towage amounted to USD 120m (USD 147m).

Terminals under construction progressed according to plan, and Moin, Costa Rica, had its first vessel call in 2018.
The volume growth of 11%, 10% like-for-like, was above the estimated market growth of around 3.5-4.0% and driven by closer

collaboration, with Ocean volumes growing 19%, 15% like-for-like. The volumes from external customers grew by 7.3%, 7.6% likefor-like, supported by net 15 new contracts won (26 won and 11 lost), with a net impact of 1.3m annualised moves. Other commercial initiatives include the successful implementation of a digital customer solution in Bahrain, and in Onne, Nigeria.
Volume growth was also supported by ramp- up in new terminals in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico, and in Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala. On an equity-weighted basis, volume in moves grew 9.1%, 7.4% like-for-like.

Terminals & Towage segment Terminals & Towage includes gateway terminals involving landside activities (being port activities where the customers are mainly the carriers), and towage services under the Svitzer brand.
Terminal towage is a one-customer operation. The customer is a port, a terminal or owner of an offshore facility. The contract is for specific vessels, and the customer determines which work the vessel performs. The annualised EBITDA per tug measure is the relevant measurement.
Harbour towage is a multi-customer operation in a common user facility. The customers are vessel owners and operators, either contracted for one to three years or booked call-by-call. The number of operational tug jobs (utilisation) is the relevant measurement.

Revenue per move increased by 3.0% to USD 252 (USD 245), driven by a higher proportion of volume from North and Latin America, higher revenue from landside customers mainly in Africa, a one-off settlement in North America, and terminals divested during 2017 (Tacoma, US, and Zeebrugge, Belgium). This was partly offset by negative rate of exchange impacts mainly in Latin America. Adjusted for the rate of exchange impact, the volume mix effects between operating terminals and from divested terminals, the revenue per move was in line with 2017. The volume mix effect relates to the impact on revenue per move from changes in the share of volumes from different terminals.

The cost per move decreased by 2.1% to USD 216 (USD 221), driven by an increase in utilisation, cost-reduction initiatives and rate of exchange effects. Examples of cost-reduction initiatives include the implementation of Lean methodology in operational processes in selected terminals and a procurement excellence programme. Cost per move reductions were partially offset by one-off costs related to a new operating system in North America, inflationary labour and concession costs, and volume mix effects. Adjusted for the rate of exchange impact and the volume mix effects between operating terminals and from divested terminals, the cost per move decreased by 4%.

Key initiatives in 2018
The construction of a USD 860m greenfield terminal in Moin, Costa Rica, progressed according to plan. The terminal celebrated an important milestone in 2018 with the first vessel call by Maersk Line, Cap Beatrice, in October 2018.
In Tema, Ghana, a USD 778m expansion project progressed according to plan with more than half of capital expenditure booked in 2018 and prior years. The implementation project in Vado, Italy, also progressed according to plan and is expected to go-live by the end of 2019, while Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is expected to go-live in 2021.
A number of divestments were made in 2018. The divestment of Izmir, Turkey, in Q4 was the largest of the divestments. Additionally, APM Terminals divested its minority share in Paranagua, Brazil, and ownership in Khalifa Bin Salman Port, Bahrain, was reduced via an IPO. In Bahrain, APM Terminals continues to operate the terminal, holding majority ownership.

Directors' report Performance 2018

The EBITDA margin increased by 2.7 percentage points compared to 2017, driven by improved utilisation, higher revenue per move, lower cost per move and the ramp-up of new terminals, with 2017 being impacted by the cyber-attack.
Consequently, the quarterly EBITDA margin increased by 4.3 percentage points to 18.6% (14.3%) during the past two years.
Volumes grew in all regions except Europe. The Americas grew by 28%, mainly driven

by the ramp-up in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico, and Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala, the integration of Maersk Line and Hamburg Süd, and by new services with external customers in Los Angeles, in the US. In Africa and the Middle East, volumes increased by 4.9%, mainly driven by West Africa. Volume in Asia grew by 2.6%, mainly driven by South Asia entities. Growth in Europe was overall flat compared to 2017.
The Americas was the region that saw the biggest increase in EBITDA margin to 13.5% (8.9%). The main driver was high volume

growth in Latin America, especially driven by the Hamburg Süd integration as well as external volume growth and a one-off settlement in Los Angeles. This more than offset one-off costs related to the implementation of a new terminal operating system in North America. In Europe, the EBITDA margin decreased by 1percentage point, mainly due to negative volume growth in certain terminals. In Africa and the Middle East, the EBITDA margin increased by 1.6percentage points, mainly due to higher storage revenue in the West African terminals, while the EBITDA margin in Asia decreased by 0.6 percentage points, mainly driven by East and South Asian entities.

Results from joint ventures and associated companies
The increase in profit from joint ventures and associated companies to USD 158m (loss of USD 86m) was due to impairments of USD 265m in 2017. Excluding the impairments, the profit from joint ventures and associated companies decreased by USD 21m compared to 2017, mainly due to one-offs in West African terminals.

Los Angeles

Collaboration and digital solutions in Los Angeles and Bahrain

BUSINESS CASE Closer collaboration between Maersk and APM Terminals Pier 400, Los Angeles, created new opportunities and better customer experience.

Closer collaboration between APM Terminals Pier 400, Los Angeles and Maersk Line has provided a good outcome for beneficial cargo owners and helped further increase volumes in Los Angeles.
The collaboration resulted in savings for a large electronics company in South Korea

which was facing delays with exports from its factory in Mexico due to network rescheduling. Maersk Korea and Pier 400 immediately decided to use trucks to shift the cargo from Mexico to Los Angeles. The cargo started arriving on a Friday, and by the following Tuesday, a Maersk Line vessel carrying electronics cargo departed Pier 400.

Ocean Logistics & Services Terminals & Towage Manufacturing & Others Discontinued operations Sustainability
Bahrain

BUSINESS CASE The implementation of digital customer solutions for landside customers in Bahrain since mid-2018 resulted in the onboarding of 1,200 users and saved almost seven man-years of transaction time for customers.

Landside customers had to visit the terminal 15 kilometres from the city for all their port dealings, causing issues such as long queues at appointment offices, a lack of transparency on available time slots, and complaints about the inability to process online payments.

The innovative solutions resulted in considerable time savings for customers in the appointment process (from 3-4 hours to 1-2 minutes). The appointment process is now more transparent, and helps customers to better plan and manage their cargo flows.

By mid-2018, APM Terminals' digital team launched an advanced online platform in Bahrain to directly track and trace cargo realtime, check the status of shipments/vessels, schedule appointments such as deliveries and container stripping, and receive and pay invoices online with 24/7 support.

The terminal is moving towards only using digital import bookings from 2019 ­ thereby ensuring efficiency savings for APM Terminals. The digital portal is also allowing customers to incrementally purchase value-added services such as container stripping and storage, increasing APM Terminals' participation in the container supply chain.

Towage
Financial and operational performance
Revenue from towage activities amounted to USD 692m (USD 659m), mainly impacted by increases in the Americas by USD 18m, in Australia by USD 10m, and in Europe by USD 8m, offset by a USD 3m decrease in revenue in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Like-forlike growth adjusted for currency developments totalled 4.6%.
Harbour towage activities measured by the number of tug jobs increased by 5.9% compared to 2017, mainly driven by increased activity in the Americas and Australia. For terminal towage, annualised EBITDA per tug increased compared to 2017 with a positive impact from new contracts in 2018, partially

offset by a negative currency impact. The idle fleet in terminal towage has been reduced, which positively impacted EBITDA per tug.
Volumes in Australia improved due to higher commodity exports, and because of increased market share for harbour towage in competitive ports in Australia.
Activity in Europe remained stable, and Svitzer's market share for harbour towage in competitive ports was on par with 2017. However, more intense competition from consolidation amongst towage providers and the increasing supply of tugs led to lower prices.

ramped up with operations in Costa Rica partially commenced in 2018.
In Asia, the Middle East and Africa, activity was in line with 2017, while some cost reductions were achieved. The cost reductions related to trimming the onshore organisation and the divestment of idle vessels. During 2018, towage operations commenced in Bangladesh as well as in Tangier Med II, Morocco.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure amounted to USD 120m (USD 147m). Towage sold 13 vessels with a cash flow impact of USD 14m in 2018.

In the Americas, activity in both Argentina and Brazil increased, driven by new customers in ports entered during 2018, and additional volumes and market share in the ports entered in 2017. Also, the terminal towage activities

Free cash flow amounted to USD 74m (USD 83m).
The market
Activity levels in the harbour towage markets remain stable. For harbour towage in Europe, consolidation in the industry persists, leading to stronger competitors and more intense competition. In Australia, a new competitor started up at the end of 2018, which increases competition.

The strategic focus is still to improve cost levels and productivity, while utilising and expanding the global footprint to ensure closer cooperation with targeted customers.
The activity growth in terminal towage remains low, reflecting fewer offshore development projects initiated by oil companies.

45 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Key initiatives in 2018
The existing market portfolio continued to be optimised by focusing on growth in selected markets such as Argentina and Brazil.
Towage activities have been positively impacted by further cooperation with other A.P. Moller - Maersk businesses during 2018. These synergies within A.P. Moller - Maersk have generated additional volumes in various ports in Brazil, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in Bremerhaven, Germany, in Poti, Georgia, and in Tangier Med II, Morocco, as well as secured contracts with start in early 2019 in Monrovia, Liberia, and in Antwerp, Belgium.
To address the increased commercial pressure resulting from fewer new projects, slow growth in vessel calls and overcapacity of towage tonnage in certain geographic markets, optimisation of the fleet utilisation continued through repositioning or selling vessels. With increased market shares and an unchanged harbour towage fleet, vessel utilisation has improved. The ongoing fleet optimisation continued, with the disposal of 13 idle vessels during 2018. The focus on improving customer satisfaction continued, along with efforts to strengthen the relationships with global customers.

Having exited the dry container business, Maersk Container Industry will focus on growing its cold chain business.
46 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Manufacturing & Others
Manufacturing & Others´ revenue increased by 51% to USD 2.5bn (USD 1.7bn), impacted by the inclusion of acquired bulk activities from Hamburg Süd and a higher level of oil/ bunker trading with third parties. EBITDA of USD 59m (USD 173m) was negatively impacted by dry container margins under pressure as well as by restructuring costs in Maersk Container Industry and lower EBITDA across other businesses, in particular in Maersk Oil Trading.
Maersk Container Industry decided to consolidate its reefer container manufacturing in Qingdao, China, and the facility in San Antonio, Chile, was closed in June. Profitability was significantly impacted by dry container margins being under severe pressure, and was significantly below the level in 2017. In December 2018, it was decided to idle down operations at the dry factory in Dongguan, China, and in January 2019, Maersk Container Industry announced the decision to exit the dry container business altogether, including the manufacturing facility in Dongguan.

Ocean Logistics & Services Terminals & Towage Manufacturing & Others Discontinued operations Sustainability

Financial and operational performance
Maersk Container Industry reported revenue of USD 978m (USD 1.0bn). Revenue in reefer containers and services increased by 7%, despite the closing of the factory in Chile, driven by higher demand from third-party customers and by selling both integrated reefers and Star Cool units, while revenue in dry containers decreased by 24% due to lower sales prices and lower volumes.
Maersk Container Industry won large thirdparty reefer orders, and concluded both its

single biggest order and the largest total volume within a year. Demand from the Ocean segment accounted for approx. 40% (65%) of reefer containers and 39% (82%) of total revenue including dry containers and services.
Volumes as number of containers in reefer including integrated containers, reefer boxes and Star cool units were 47,932 (45,645), and in dry containers 69,549 (94,699).
The EBITDA of USD 40m (USD 87m) was due to the negative development in profitability on dry containers and restructuring costs

With the consolidation of reefer activities in China and the exit from the dry container business, Maersk Container Industry will focus fully on growing its cold chain business and will continue to design, manufacture, sell and service the Star Cool Technology. This focused growth will require further investments in the best products and services.
Maersk Container Industry's other locations, including the reefer factory in Qingdao, China, and operations in Denmark, are not impacted by the closing of the two container factories, but will continue their operations and support the global network of customers.
Maersk Container Industry managed to win major reefer tenders with global container operators and fruit multinationals with its Integrated Star Cool reefers, while also increasing the sale of Star Cool units, which for the first time exceeded reefer container sales.
Maersk Container Industry announced SekstantTM Global Guidance in November. The system for reefer digitalisation is the most significant technological breakthrough since the introduction of the Star Cool reefer machinery. SekstantTM will provide container operators with accurate data at any point along the transportation chain, enabling optimisation of operations and transparency towards their shippers. At the same time, this will take the value chain for Maersk Container Industry to a new level through the utilisation of operational data and big data analysis.

Listing of Maersk Drilling
Following an evaluation of the different options available to Maersk Drilling, A.P. Moller - Maersk has concluded that Maersk Drilling as a stand-alone company presents the most optimal and long-term prospects for its shareholders. This will offer shareholders the possibility of parti cipating in a value-creation opportunity for a global, leading pure-play offshore drilling company with long-term development prospects. Details on the demerger and separate listing will be announced at a later stage.

In Q4, Maersk Drilling made the progress necessary to ensure that the entity is ready for a demerger in 2019, with the ambition of being both organisationally and financially ready to operate as an independent entity in due time before a listing.
As part of the preparations for the separation, debt financing of USD 1.5bn, out of which USD 1.2bn has been released as cash proceeds to A.P. Moller - Maersk, from a consortium of international banks has been agreed for Maersk Drilling to ensure a solid capital

structure after a listing. The Board of Directors was strengthened in January 2019, and a clear governance structure has been established.

Maersk Drilling
Maersk Drilling reported a revenue of USD 1.4bn (USD 1.4bn), while EBITDA was USD 611m (USD 683m), negatively impacted by several idle rigs and lower day rates combined with costs for the planned separation. High operational uptime, more contracted days and a one-off had a positive effect on EBITDA.
Maersk Drilling reported solid cash conversion from an operational cash flow of USD 564m (USD 712m) and limited maintenance CAPEX.

The strong operational performance across the fleet resulted in an average operational uptime of 98% (98%) for the jack-up rigs and 97% (98%) for the deepwater rigs.
The market
Oil prices were volatile in 2018, reaching approx. USD 85 per barrel in October, but ending the year at USD 53, driven by an uncertain demand outlook and robust supply, particularly from onshore US. Global rig demand continued to rise in 2018, albeit at a slow pace. Oversupply is still a factor, keep- ing utilisation rates at moderate levels. Total utilisation for floaters and jack-up rigs at the

end of 2018 stood at 66% and 59%, respectively. Two jack-up rigs and five floaters were scrapped in Q4, bringing the 2018 total attrition figures to 36 jack-up rigs and 20 floaters. Scrapping activity remains limited to relatively older rigs, as contractors are optimistic about a coming rebound in demand. Estimates for a 2018 greenfield capital commitment for offshore projects were revised downwards in Q4 to USD 84bn from Q3 estimates of USD 94bn. The industry continues to target cost reduction through operational efficiency improvements, integrated alliances and partnerships, financial restruc turing, and mergers and acquisitions.

Maersk Drilling signed 12 new contracts and further extended 13 contracts during 2018, adding 4,022 days and USD 503m to the backlog. By the end of 2018, Maersk Drilling's total revenue backlog amounted to USD 2.5bn (USD 3.3bn), with forward contract coverage of 69% for 2018, 63% for 2019 and 37% for 2020.
In 2018, Maersk Drilling launched a new strategic ambition ´Smarter Drilling for Better Value´, with the aim of combining the leading drilling services with new services and innovative business models. The objective is to drive long-term business opportunities through increased customer collaboration, differentiation and asset utilisation. In this way, Maersk Drilling is at the forefront of change, and is recognised for its collaborative and innovative business approach which has enabled Maersk Drilling to forge strong alliances in the industry. The first example was the alliance with Aker BP, which aims at lowering the cost per barrel and increasing profitability for the partners while giving Maersk Drilling a preferential right to provide jack-up rigs for Aker BP in Norway. In September 2018, Maersk Integrator became the first rig to be contracted fully under alliance conditions.
In December 2018, Maersk Drilling entered yet another unique alliance with Seapulse Ltd. In this alliance, Maersk Drilling will provide fully integrated services, including the provision of rigs and related services to remove complexity across the entire value chain for a global 12 well exploration drilling programme.

revised expectations of a fair value of Maersk Supply Service due to continued challenging market conditions.

Maersk Supply Service reported an 8% in- crease in revenue to USD 263m (USD 244m), reflecting higher utilisation and higher project activity. EBITDA of USD 3m (USD 13m) was, however, negatively impacted by the expiry of legacy contracts and increased project cost.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure decreased to USD 333m (USD 447m) due to the payment of four (four) newbuildings with a lower average price in 2018.

The market
The industry continues to be characterised by oversupply, financial restructurings and consolidation, and Maersk Supply Service expects the market outlook for the industry to remain subdued in the near and mid-term. Tender activity is rising; however, day rates remain under significant pressure and the offshore supply vessel industry has approx. 30% of vessels laid up globally, including Maersk Supply Service with 14 (15) vessels laid up at the end of 2018, corresponding to 33%. When including both laid-up and idle vessels, the industry percentage increases to approx. 47%.

Key initiatives in 2018

Important contract wins and extensions were secured in all five core geographic regions ­ North America, Europe, West Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific ­ ensuring utilisation of vessels. However, rates remain under pressure.
Within the integrated solutions area, the transportation and hook-up of the FSO in the Culzean field in the North Sea was completed in Q3, marking the last step of the installation under the project management of Maersk Supply Service. Over the course of the project, eight vessels and Maersk Supply Service crew carried out the marine operations. During Q4, a newbuild Subsea Support Vessel (SSV) was contracted to perform light well intervention work in Angola, which marks the first contract in this work scope for Maersk Supply Service, illustrating progress in a new service area. During Q3, Maersk Supply Service project-managed the decommissioning of

the Leadon subsea field in the North Sea. The recovery of the towhead was completed by another of the company's newbuild SSVs.
Maersk Supply Service's strategy to diversify its business into new markets has progressed, demonstrating the versatility of the fleet. Within the offshore wind industry, Maersk Supply Service has deployed a newbuild SSV performing walk-to-work duties, which is the first job within this important market. In Q2, an innovation partnership with Vestas aimed at lowering the logistics and installation costs within sustainable energy solutions was announced. In addition, Maersk Supply Service deployed two vessels to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organisation, for installing the world's first clean-up system in the North Pacific to rid the oceans of plastic.

Maersk Decom joint venture
The joint venture between Maersk Supply Service and Maersk Drilling to provide bundled decommissioning solutions was fully established as of June 2018. While rising oil prices have led to some project delays in the market, as decommissioning increasingly competes for funding alongside exploration and production activities, Maersk Decom has received a positive response from both operators and regulators. The company began work on its first study contract in December 2018, and is engaged in in-depth project development dialogue with North Sea operators.

Maersk Supply Service
During 2018, the final of four Maersk Supply Service I-class Stingray newbuild vessels were delivered, and are now servicing global customers.
Decommissioning in the North Sea
Decommissioning involves the safe plugging of wells and the disposal of equipment used in offshore oil and gas production.
Inspection, Maintenance & Repair (IMR) services in Mexico
IMR is the provision of inspecting, maintaining and repairing offshore production units.

Light well intervention in West Africa
Light well intervention is the servicing of subsea wells on the seabed using a vessel instead of a drilling rig.
Walk-to-work in the North Sea
Walk-to-work is an accommodation service for wind turbine personnel, enabling them to access and maintain offshore wind turbines.

Sustainability
The link between business and sustainable, responsible practices is growing stronger, as global challenges, such as climate change and anti-globalisation grow. A.P. Moller - Maersk is responding to the growing expectations on the part of investors, customers and employees with leadership projects on transformational issues directly associated with the businesses and ensuring integrity in everything Maersk does.

With the Paris Agreement on climate change and the establishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which are both supported by almost all countries in the world, companies are being given a new role as co-providers of solutions to critical issues, as innovators, as investors and as key players in implementing commercially viable solutions for a sustainable economy at scale.
A.P. Moller - Maersk welcomes this opportunity, and understands that while it opens doors for business, it also adds to the expectations of accountability and transparency by stakeholders ­ including shareholders. Responsible practices are therefore as important as ever, while demands on being able to manage and communicate on sustainability-related risks are growing. The largest change, however, is the growing expectation that companies use their business activities to create and drive positive impact ­ alone or in partnership with others.
The sustainability strategy encompasses these expectations with a non-wavering focus on responsible business practices with all material

issues, and four priority programmes that will enable the companies to drive the develop ment of large-scale solutions that target some of the world's major sustainability challenges, while at the same time supporting business development.
Taking the lead on climate change
Nowhere is this clearer than the growing urgency to tackle climate change. The latest assessments from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change leave no doubt as to the need for the world in general to go through a deep transformation away from its reliance on fossil fuels. Maersk wants to play a clear and leading role in driving the shipping industry's transformative process. This is the only responsible thing to do, but such efforts and investments are also believed to create strategic benefits for the business. At the same time, the risks of early mover disa dvantages are being considered, and efforts are being made to avoid these through informative new framework conditions that will support the goal of having commercially viable vessels on the water by 2030.

Progress on key issues
Efforts to manage other material sustainability risks, responsibilities and opportunities also progressed in 2018.
A new approach to safety
Having reached a plateau in safety performance, and more importantly with high- potential events, particularly those resulting in fatalities, continuing to occur, significant steps to renew and step up the approach to safety were taken. In 2018, seven people regrettably lost their lives in connection with business operations.
The approach to ensuring safety will be fundamentally embedded in all aspects of the organisation, and will involve every part of the business, every employee and all business processes. An executive task force has developed the approach, which was approved by the Board of Directors, and it will be delivered through a new corporate safety function and new levels of both leadership and employee engagement.
Accidents are never intentional, but occur because of many factors coinciding, and there is rarely a correlation between the efforts being made to prevent minor events and injuries and high-potential accidents or events. In future, more focus will be directed at building the organisational capacity and operational controls that act as barriers to accidents which could otherwise have escalated to life-changing or fatal outcomes.

New targets

Net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 In 2018, a new company ambition of netzero CO2 emissions from own operations by 2050 was set. This will drive a transformation of the shipping industry towards using carbon-neutral fuels.
Until decarbonisation is achieved, decoupling business growth from emissions is a necessity. An efficiency target of 60% relative reduction in CO2 by 2030 from a 2008 baseline has been set. Due to the efforts over the past decade, 41% of these reductions have already been achieved.
A call for innovation and collaboration To deliver on the target, massive innovation in ship and engine design and fuel transformation must take place in the next 5-10 years.
A. P. Moller - Maersk is committed to becoming a leader in this process, and will dedicate resources and efforts towards research collaborations, technical development,

customer engagement and regulatory advocacy. In addition, Maersk will call on all parties involved to collaborate on incentives and to develop innovative solutions.
Risks from the physical impacts of climate change Another aspect of climate change that is being prepared for are the physical impacts and potential risk to business assets and value. This work has been furthered by the investment community's focus on climate change from a financial risk perspective, as demonstrated in the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-r elated Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2018, a hot-spot analysis aimed at estimating the effect of five climate hazards on ports, other fixed assets and strategic commodities within a 2020­ 2040 time-frame was conducted. Further analysis of selected regions of material importance to the business to determine the future approach to building climate change resilience will be performed.

Open and inclusive trade
Tensions over global trade are currently at their highest level for many years. A positive outcome will depend on an orderly process to revise the global rule book on trade, reflecting the need for greater balance, inclusion and sustainability in trade.
In 2018, an ambitious set of commitments was adopted to help multiply the benefits of trade for both society and business by leveraging

the capabilities of A.P. Moller - Maersk as an integrated transport and logistics company to reduce complexity in global value chains. This will enable more countries and more companies to trade in simpler, cleaner, faster and cheaper ways. The commitments also aim to help empower small businesses to have better access to the benefits of trade, and thereby to support innovation and job creation. To deliver on these commitments, new partnerships were entered into and developed in 2018.

New targets
Zero
net-emissions from own operations by 2050.
60%
relative reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 (2008 baseline).
2018 results
41%
relative reduction in CO2 emissions from own activities compared to 2008 baseline.

A level playing field for SOx
The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 0.5% global cap on the sulphur dioxide (SOx) content in fuels for shipping will enter into force on 1 January 2020. To enable enforcement of the global cap, the IMO in 2018 decided on a carriage ban for non-compliant fuels on board vessels. Vessels with scrubbers installed for cleaning the exhaust gasses are exempted from this ban. The OECD estimates the cost of switching to new, compliant fuels at up to USD 15bn per year for the container shipping industry, equalling around USD 2bn annually for Maersk. To prepare for the 2020 global cap, Maersk: · invested in creating a global hub for
low-sulphur bunker fuel. More such options are being explored · decided to apply scrubber technology to several vessels · entered into dialogue with customers on additional fuel costs.
Transforming ship recycling
Maersk continues to work with ship recycling yards in Alang, India, to prove the viability of more options for responsible ship recycling. In 2018, the European Union (EU) introduced a list of approved yards for the recycling of vessels carrying EU flags. The desire to be included on this list is encouraging the transformation of Alang, where at least 66% of the yards are now investing in improvements. The current version of the EU list does not include Indian yards; however, it will be updated on an ongoing basis.

ship recycling practices against a comprehensive set of disclosure criteria, which is also followed by Maersk. The SRTI allows for sharing the risks related to investing in the transformation of ship recycling.
Reducing food loss
The commitment to contribute to halving food loss by 2030 is a new area in the sustainability strategy. The goal is to build capabilities in the supply chain in countries with a high prevalence of food loss in the production and transportation stages, and to enhance their ability to benefit from food loss-reducing solutions. This will increase local traders' participation in trade, and potentially allow growth in the cold chain business.
In 2018, relevant organisations for potential partnerships were mapped, and a memorandum of understanding was signed with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for future cooperation on food loss projects at country level.

Møller - Mærsk A/S is continuously developing its corporate governance in response to the strategic development, goals and activities, as well as to the external environment and input from stakeholders.

The five core values ´Constant Care´, ´Humbleness´, ´Uprightness´, ´Our Employees´ and ´Our Name´ remain pillars for the way in which A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S conducts its business. Engrained in the company for more than a century, these corporate values are continuously being promoted throughout the global organisation, and serve as guiding principles for employees and leaders.
The governance structure supports close coordination between the Board of Directors, the Executive Board and leaders throughout the organisation. The structure promotes the objectives of: · Early identification of opportunities and
challenges. · Efficient processes for informed deci-
sion-making. · Agile planning and fast execution. · Sound controls, checks and balances and
compliance. · Clear allocation of authorities and respon-
sibilities. · Safe operations.

To organise the preparation and conduct of Board meetings in the most efficient manner, the Board has established an Annual Plan in cooperation with the Executive Board. The Annual Plan outlines the main items and focus points for each ordinary Board meeting and topics on which the Executive Board is expected to report as well as matters for deliberation or approval by the Board members. The Annual Plan ensures that all relevant topics are covered sufficiently during the year.

During the summer of 2018, an externally facilitated Board evaluation process was conducted, among others covering the co- operation between the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, the Chairman's role, the Board's and Board committees´ effectiveness and results as well as an assessment of Board capabilities relative to those best supporting the company's strategy. All members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board participated in the evaluation process and provided input via questionnaires and individual interviews, thus forming the basis of a comprehensive evaluation report. The results were discussed in plenary sessions of the Board of Directors and in one-to-one sessions between the Chairman and individual members of the Board and the Executive Board.
The main conclusions and outcomes of the board evaluation were: · The Board's work has undergone a posi-
tive development in 2017-2018 by improving dynamics and organisation, engagement and the level of challenges and sparring offered by and among the Board and the Executive Board. · The size of the Board is considered efficient and appropriate. · As the company changes from being a conglomerate to focusing on global transport and logistics, the competencies of the Board should evolve accordingly. · The key competencies and areas of experience and expertise required on the Board are: Shipping, transport and logistics, IT/digital/tech and e-commerce, business transformation, innovation and entrepreneurship,

Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee
A.P. Moller - Maersk established the Remuneration Committee in May 2018 to ensure that the remuneration policy and practices support the company's strategy and create value for shareholders. Since the establishment of the Committee, it has been committed to strengthening the governance, refining the operating model and structuring the annual remuneration agenda. This allows the Committee to follow a steady cadence which supports the consistency and quality of its work. In 2018, the disclosure of executive remuneration has been a focus area. The Remuneration Committee is working towards ensuring increased transparency for shareholders as well as identifying how remuneration can be actively utilised to connect the interests of executive management with shareholder interests. In the light of upcoming amendments to remuneration disclosure as part of the Shareholder Rights Directive, and the recently updated Danish Corporate Governance Code, the remuneration section of this report has been expanded from previous years to provide greater transparency, and it will continue to be developed in future.

Executive Board short-term cash incentive
The short-term cash incentive plan is one of the main vehicles for driving pay for company performance. It provides Executive Board members with an annual cash award that is linked to performance against defined targets for the financial year.
The short-term cash incentive plan of 2018 had a key focus on financial measures, including underlying profit, revenue and cash flow.

In addition, transformational measures and customer experience were emphasised to support the focus on the need for the company to transform and move towards becoming the global integrator of container logistics.
Targets for these measurements were set in accordance with guidance provided to the external market for underlying profit and internal business plans for the remaining measurements.

In 2018, the Committee has reviewed the short-term cash incentive plan for the Exec utive Board. As approved at the Annual General Meeting in April 2018, the target incentive opportunity for the Executive Board members was changed from 25% to 40-50% of the fixed base salary, and the maximum incentive opportunity was changed from 50% to 80-100% of the fixed base salary. The changes were made to better align with European market practice and incentivise the Executive Board members to achieve the company's short-term goals.

1 R eference is made to the income statement for a reconciliation from EBITDA to profit/loss.
As part of the A.P. Moller - Maersk strategy of becoming the global integrator of container logistics, the reportable segments have been reorganised as of Q1 2018 in ´Ocean', ´Logistics & Services', ´Terminals & Towage' and ´Manufacturing & Others'.
The Ocean segment with the activities of Maersk Liner Business (Maersk Line, Safmarine and Sealand ­ A Maersk Company) together with the Hamburg Süd brands (Hamburg Süd and Aliança) as well as strategic transshipment hubs under the APM Terminals brand. Inland activities related to Maersk Liner Business are included in the Logistics & Services segment.
The Logistics & Services segment with the logistics and supply chain management services, container inland services, inland haulage activities (intermodal), trade finance services and freight forwarding.
The Terminals & Towage segment including gateway terminals, involving landside activities such as port activities where the customers are mainly the carriers, and towage services under the Svitzer brand.
The Manufacturing & Others segment with Maersk Container Industry and others.
The segment disclosures provided above reflect the information which the Executive Board receives monthly in its capacity as `chief operating decision-maker' as defined in IFRS 8. The allocation of resources and the segment performance are evaluated based on revenue and profitability measured according to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).

Accrued income included in trade receivables in the balance sheet constitutes contract assets comprising unbilled amounts to customers representing the Group's right to consideration for the services transferred to date. Any amount previously recognised as accrued income is reclassified to trade receivables at the time it is invoiced to the customer.
Under the payment terms generally applicable to the Group's revenue generating activities, prepayments are received only to a limited extent. Typically, payment is due upon or after completion of the services.
Part of the deferred income presented in the balance sheet constitutes contract liabilities which represents advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognised.
There were no significant changes in accrued income and deferred income during the reporting period.
Impairment losses disclosed in Note 17 relate to receivables arising from contracts with customers.

GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION Revenue for the shipping activities is based on the destination for ships operated by the Group and on customer location for ships on time charter. For non-current assets (e.g. terminals), which cannot be easily moved, geographical location is where the assets are located. For all other assets, geographical location is based on the legal ownership. These assets consist mainly of ships and containers registered in China, Denmark, Singapore and the US.

1 Acquisition of Hamburg Süd, please refer to note 21 ´Acquisition/sale of subsidiaries and activities'. 2 O f which USD 826m (USD 647m) is under development, primarily relating to APM Terminals Moin S.A., Costa Rica. USD 34m (USD 34m) is related to terminal rights with indefinite useful life in Poti Sea Port Corp. The impairment test is based on the
estimated fair value according to business plans. An average discount rate of 8.97% (14.8%) p.a. after tax has been applied in the calculations. Furthermore, the developments in volumes and rates are significant parameters. Service concession rights with a carrying amount of USD 80m (USD 94m) have restricted title. 3 Of which USD 30m (USD 20m) is related to ongoing development of software.

Intangible assets

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on the higher of its value-in-use or fair value less cost to sell. The value-in-use is calculated using certain key assumptions for the expected future cash flows and applied discount factor.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and business plans approved by management. In nature, these projections are subject to judgement and estimates that are uncertain, though based on experience and external sources where available. The discount rates applied reflect the time value of money as well as the specific risks related to the underlying cash flows, i.e. project and/or country-specific risk premium. Further, any uncertainties reflecting past performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.
During 2017, certain terminals were faced with challenging market outlooks with decreasing volumes and rates which resulted in impairment losses as recoverable amounts were lower than the carrying amount.
For the intangible assets in Terminals & Towage, the impairment losses can be specified as follows:

Operating segment GOODWILL Terminals & Towage
TERMINAL AND SERVICE CONCESSION RIGHTS
Terminals & Towage
OTHER RIGHTS Terminals & Towage Total

Applied discount rate p.a. after tax

The most significant goodwill amount relates to the Ocean segment, where the impairment test is based on the estimated value in use from five-year business plans and a calculated terminal value with growth equal to the expected economic growth of 2% p.a. in both 2018 and 2017. A discount rate of 7.7% (8.7%) has been applied. For further information on impairment considerations, reference is made to note 24.
The key assumptions for Terminals & Towage's value calculations are container moves, revenue and cost per move and discount rate. The cash flow projections cover the concession period and extension options where deemed likely that they will be exercised. The growth rates assumed reflect current market expectations for the relevant period.

Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
Discontinued operations include Maersk Oil up to closing in March 2018, Maersk Tankers up to closing in October 2017 as well as Maersk Drilling where A.P. Moller - Maersk will pursue a demerger via a separate listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen on 4 April 2019. A structural solution for Maersk Supply Service is expected within 12 months. The results of the discontinued operations are presented in one separate line in the income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet. Both the income statement and cash flow statement have been restated in previous periods, while the balance sheet has not been restated.
A.P. Moller - Maersk executed on the strategy to separate out its energy businesses in 2017 with an agreement for Total S.A. to acquire Maersk Oil for USD 7,450m in a combined share and debt transaction, and A.P. Moller Holding to acquire Maersk Tankers for USD 1.2bn in an all-cash transaction.
In the consolidated financial statements, the results for Maersk Oil, Maersk Tankers, Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Service are classified under discontinued operations with a net profit of USD 3.4bn (loss of USD 970m), positively impacted by the gain of USD 2.6bn on the sale of Maersk Oil. The cash flow from operating activities was USD 896m (USD 2.0bn), while the cash flow from investing activities, including the net cash proceeds from the Maersk Oil transaction, amounted to USD 1.5bn (negative USD 580m). Total cash flow from the discontinued operations amounted to USD 3.4bn (USD 1.3bn).
Intangible assets held for sale amount to USD 91m for Maersk Drilling and USD 6m for Maersk Supply Service. Property, plant and equipment held for sale mainly consists of Maersk Drilling in the amount of USD 4.9bn and Maersk Supply Service in the amount of USD 838m.

MAERSK DRILLING Full year 2018 Maersk Drilling reported a profit of USD 979m (loss of USD 1.5bn), with 2018 impacted by the positive fair value adjustment of USD 445m due to an improved market outlook and no depreciation being recognised after classification as discontinued operations in Q3 2017. The result of 2017 was negatively impacted by an impairment of USD 1.8bn following classification as discontinued operations.
Property, plant and equipments with a carrying amount of USD 4.7bn have been pledged as security for loans of USD 1.5bn. As part of the preparation, debt financing from a consortium of international banks of USD 1.5bn has been agreed for Maersk Drilling to ensure a solid capital structure after a listing. In certain circumstances, earnings in respect of drilling contracts for the collateral rigs will be assigned in favour of the lenders under the loan agreements.
MAERSK SUPPLY SERVICE Full year 2018 Maersk Supply Service reported a loss of USD 418m (loss of USD 251m), impacted by the negative fair value adjustment of USD 400m recognised in Q3 2018 due to continued challenging market conditions. The result was positively impacted by no depreciation being recognised after classification as discontinued operations in Q4 2017.

MAERSK OIL On 21 August 2017, A.P. Moller - Maersk announced the sale of Maersk Oil to Total S.A. The transaction, which was based on a locked box mechanism from 30 June 2017, closed on 8 March 2018 with an accounting gain of USD 2.6bn. In addition to the net cash proceeds of USD 2.0bn after closing adjustments and free cash flow of USD 0.3bn up to closing, A.P. Moller - Maersk received 97.5m shares in Total S.A., equivalent to an ownership interest of 3.7%. The market value of the Total S.A. shares was USD 5.6bn at closing on 8 March 2018. The accounting gain comprises the original gain calculated on 30 June 2017 of USD 2.8bn less the profit of USD 1.0bn recognised in the period from 1 July 2017 up to closing and the addition of the locked box interest and positive Total S.A. share price development totalling USD 0.8bn.
Period ended 8 March 2018 Maersk Oil reported a profit of USD 148m (USD 1.2bn) before elimination of internal interests. The gain and cash flow from closing the transaction is summarised below (comparative figures relate to the sale of Maersk Tankers in 2017):

SECONDARY DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITY As part of the divestment of Mærsk Olie & Gas A/S (MOGAS) to Total S.A., A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (APMM) has assumed a secondary liability related to the decommissioning of the offshore facilities in Denmark by issuance of a declaration. APMM assesses the risk of economic outflows due to this secondary liability as very remote.
The potential beneficiaries of the declaration of secondary liability are the other participants in Danish Underground Consortium (DUC) and the Danish state. The declaration covers decommissioning costs related to DUC's offshore facilities in Denmark which existed as at 28 February 2018. The secondary liability is limited to decommissioning costs related to MOGAS's participating interest in DUC at that point in time (which was 31.2%). At close on 8 March 2018, MOGAS's provision for these decommissioning costs amounted to USD 1.2bn. APMM's secondary liability will be reduced as facilities are decommissioned at the cost of Danish Underground Consortium.
The payment obligation under the declaration of secondary liability is triggered towards the other participants in DUC if: a) MOGAS or a potential successor of MOGAS does not perform its payment obligations in respect of decommissioning costs, b) the non-defaulting DUC participants have exhausted the special remedies in the joint operating agreement; and c) payment of the full amount under the guarantee(s) issued by or on behalf of MOGAS has not been made upon receipt of a payment request. The payment obligation is triggered towards the Danish state if the Danish state has paid the decommissioning costs and MOGAS, a potential successor or a guarantor does not pay in full its share of the costs upon receipt of a payment request.
In case APMM is held liable under the secondary liability described above, APMM will have full recourse for such liability against Total S.A. (the buyer of MOGAS).

The restricted shares plan was introduced in 2013, and grants have been awarded to employees on a yearly basis since 2013. Beginning in 2018, grants have also been awarded to members of the Executive Board. In 2014, the Group established a three-year performance shares plan for members of the Executive Board and other employees. The performance shares plan lapsed in 2017.
The transfer of restricted shares is contingent upon the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination, and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. For members of the Executive Board, the vesting period is five years.
The members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc. A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations regarding the restricted shares plan.

Share-based payment
The fair value of restricted shares (B shares) granted to 105 (132) employees and five members of the Executive Board was USD 8m (USD 8m) at the time of grant. The total value of granted restricted shares recognised in the income statement is USD 8m (USD 8m).
The fair value per restricted share at the time of grant is DKK 9,273 (DKK 11,550), which is equal to the volume-weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 1 April 2018.
On 1 April 2018, the restricted shares originally granted in 2015 were settled with the employees. The weighted average share price on that date was DKK 9,273.
The average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares is 1.4 years (1.3 years) at 31December 2018.
CASH-SETTLED INCENTIVE PLAN In 2015, A.P. Moller - Maersk introduced the performance shares plan to a broader range of employees. A share of the cash-settled Performance Plan lapsed in 2017, and the remaining share lapsed in 2018. The actual settlement of the awards was contingent upon the degree of certain financial goals being achieved, the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination at the date of settlement. This meant that the number of awards that eventually will vest was adjusted during the vesting period. Depending on the agreement, the settlement did take place two or three years after the initial granting, and the employee had the option to settle the awards in shares.
The employees were not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions applied regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.

SHARE OPTION PLANS In addition to the plans described above, A.P. Moller - Maersk has share option plans for members of the Executive Board and other employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominally DKK 1,000 in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.

The share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' Annual Report. Exercising the share options is contingent upon the option holder still being employed at the time of exercise. The share options can be exercised when at least two years (three years for share options granted to Executive Board members) and no more than seven years (six years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the time of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.

The share options can only be settled in shares. A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plans.

The fair value of awards granted to five (three) members of the Executive Board and 80 (79) employees was USD 7m (USD 8m) at the time of grant. The total value of granted share options recognised in the income statement is USD 6m (USD 3m).

The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise of share options was DKK 11,778 in 2017. No share options were exercised during 2018.

The average remaining contractual life is 5.5 years (6.1 years) at 31December 2018, and the exercise price for outstanding share options is DKK 12,156 (DKK 12,791).

The fair value per option granted to members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 1,712 (DKK 2,130) at the time of grant, based on Black & Scholes' option pricing model. The fair value per option granted to employees who are not members of the Executive Board is calculated at DKK 1,875 (DKK 2,281) at the time of grant based on the same option pricing model.

Note 13
Pensions and similar obligations
As an employer, the Group participates in pension plans according to normal practice in the countries in which it operates. Generally, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.
Pension and medical plans which, as part of collective bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other enterprises (known as multi-employer plans) are treated as other pension plans. Such defined benefit plans are treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient information for calculating the individual enterprise´s share of the obligation is not available.
In 2019, the Group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 27m to funded defined benefit plans (USD 36m in 2018).

The majority of the Group's defined benefit liabilities are in the UK (77 %) and the US (13 %). All the plans in the UK and the majority of the plans in the US are funded. Although all the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans.
Overall, the plans have an average duration of 16 years, and approx. 53% of the obligation is in respect of pensioner members.
As well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the Group is also subject to the risk of higher than expected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation (although some minimum and maximum limits apply).

Rates of life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality investigations, and in line with market practice an allowance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. The Group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections (1.25% in 2018 and in 2017) for all UK plans.

The liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the Group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19. The sensitivity of the liabilities and pension cost to the key assumptions are as follows:

The Group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a trustee board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis, and if the plan is in deficit, the trustees agree with the Group or the sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.
The expected contributions to the UK plans for 2019 are USD 21m and USD 32m in 2018, of which USD 0m (USD 9m in 2018) is deficit recovery contributions. In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the Group. However, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF) and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) contributions paid by the Group are not refundable in any circumstance and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the Group's assumptions. In 2018, an adjustment of USD 2m (USD 31m) was applied in this respect.

MULTI-EMPLOYER PLANS Under collective agreements, certain entities in the Group participate together with other employers in defined benefit pension plans as well as welfare/medical plans (multi-employer plans).
For the defined benefit pension plans, the Group has joint and several liabilities to fund total obligations. In 2018, the Group's contributions are estimated at USD 134m (USD 134m), while the contributions to be paid in 2019 are estimated at USD 151m. In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man-hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.
No reliable basis exists for the allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. For the plans where the Group has an interest and there is a deficit, the net obligations for all employers totalled USD 0.9bn (USD 1.1bn). This net obligation is based on the most recent available financial data from the plan's trustees, calculated in accordance with the rules for such actuarial calculations in US GAAP. The deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future.
The welfare/medical plans are by nature contribution plans funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. As for the defined benefit pension plans, the contributions are based on man-hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.

Restructuring includes provisions for decided and publicly announced restructurings. Legal disputes, etc. include among other things tax, indirect tax and duty disputes. Onerous and unfavourable contracts are mainly related to Hamburg Süd´s unfavourable lease contracts acquired in 2017. Other includes provisions for warranties and risk under certain self-insurance programmes. The provisions are subject to considerable uncertainty, cf. note 24.
Reversals of provisions primarily relate to legal disputes and contractual disagreements, which are recognised in the income statement under operating costs and tax.

Derivatives
Hedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives. Foreign exchange forwards and option contracts are used to hedge the currency risk related to recognised and unrecognised transactions. Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are used to hedge interest rate exposure on borrowings. Price hedge derivatives are used to hedge crude oil prices and bunker prices.

The hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relation between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the forward points and change in basis spread are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. The cost of hedging reserve amount is USD 1m (USD 7m).
For information about risk management strategy, currencies, maturities, etc., reference is made to note 17.
HEDGE OF BORROWINGS Cross-currency swaps are used to swap all non-USD issued bonds. Fixed to floating rate swaps are designated as a combination of fair value and cash flow hedges. The principal amounts in USD equivalents are: EUR 1,723m (EUR 1,835m), GBP 89m (GBP 95m), JPY 204m (JPY 200m) and NOK 252m (NOK 268m). The remaining swaps are fixed to fixed rate or floating to fixed rate swaps and are designated as cash flow hedges of currency and interest risk.
The hedge ratio is 1:1. The maturity of the hedge instrument 0-5 years is (USD equivalents): EUR 1,746m (EUR 3,419m), JPY 91m (JPY 89m) and NOK 344m (NOK 303m). 5-10 years: EUR 859m (EUR 0m), GBP 380m (GBP 405m), JPY 113m (JPY 111m) and NOK 252m (NOK 390m). Above 10 years: EUR 92m (EUR 96m).
Cross-currency swaps are designated as a combination of hedge of principal cash flow and hedge of interests at a weighted average rate of 4.5% (3.7%).
Interest rate swaps are all denominated in USD and pay either floating (fair value hedge) or fixed interest rates (cash flow hedge). The hedge ratio is 1:1, and the weighted average interest rate is 2.5% (2.2%) excluding margin on loans. The maturity of the interest rate swaps 0-5 years is USD 918m (USD 442m) and 5-10 years USD 1,130m (USD 1,095m).
For cash flow hedges related to borrowings, a loss of USD 80m (gain of USD 31m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedges reserve is a loss of USD 49m (gain of USD 31m). Reference is made to other comprehensive income.
The carrying amount of the borrowings in fair value hedge relation is USD 2,768m (USD 3,069m), and the accumulated fair value adjustment of the loans is a loss of USD 13m (loss of USD 28m). The loss on the hedging instrument in fair value hedges recognised in the income statement for the year amounts to USD 15m (loss of USD 33m), and the gain on hedged item amounts to USD 15m (gain of USD 33m).
Due to bond buy-back in 2018, the ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is recognised in profit or loss at USD 20m in 2018.

Derivatives

HEDGING OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES Currency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments/divestments and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment, respectively.
Hedges of future revenue, operating costs and investments mature within a year.
For hedges related to operating cash flows and investment of negative USD 89m (positive USD 55m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve is negative USD 34m (positive USD 55m).
OTHER ECONOMIC HEDGES (NO HEDGE ACCOUNTING APPLIED) Furthermore, the Group enters into derivatives to hedge economic risks that are not accounted for as hedging. These derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.
The gains/losses, including realised transactions, are recognised as follows:

Hedging foreign exchange risk on revenue Hedging foreign exchange risk on operating costs Hedging interest rate risk Hedging investment in associated companies Hedging foreign exchange risk on the cost of non-current assets Hedging foreign exchange risk on discontinued operations Total effective hedging Ineffectiveness recognised in financial expenses Total reclassified from equity reserve for hedges

EQUITY INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (FVOCI) As at 31December 2018, USD 2,447m in equity investments at FVOCI classified as current pertains to the shares in Total S.A. received from the sale of Maersk Oil. Subject to meeting its investment-grade credit rating it is the plan to return a material portion of the value of the received shares to the A.P. Moller - Maersk shareholders during 2019, and therefore the shares have been classified as current.
DISPOSAL OF THE REMAINING 19% SHARE IN DANSK SUPERMARKED GROUP In 2017, as the Salling Companies could complete the final transaction agreed on in 2014, A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S sold its remaining 19% share of Dansk Supermarked Group for DKK 5.5bn, equivalent to USD 871m.
The accumulated loss of USD 123m has been transferred within equity. The loss can be attributed to the development in the DKK/USD exchange rate since initial recognition.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE Financial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels: Level 1-- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 -- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and Level 3 -- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value of listed securities is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities are within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of derivatives is mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period. A minor amount of crude oil price derivatives is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Group's profit or equity significantly.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST Fair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
Fair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.

Note 17
Financial risks, etc.
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks:
· Market risks, i.e. currency risk, interest rate risk and share price risk · Credit risk · Liquidity risk
The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's business units.
MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and share price, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses below relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2018.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk, interest rate risk and share price risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2018. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate, interest rate and share price sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates, interest rates and share price.
CURRENCY RISK The Group's currency risk relates to the fact that while income from shipping and oil-related activities (discontinued operations) is denominated mainly in USD, the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as EUR, NOK, GBP, CNY, JPY and DKK. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including APM Terminals, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.
The main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
·Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon; ·Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged; ·Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated
cash flow.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million

An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the Group is exposed is estimated to have a negative impact on the Group's profit before tax of USD 0.1bn (positive impact of USD 0.3bn) and to affect the Group's equity, excluding tax, negatively by USD 0.3bn (positively by USD 0.0bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. notes 15 and 16, and are thus not an expression of the Group's total currency risk.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Group has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, NOK, GBP, SEK and JPY. The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range, and is primarily obtained using interest rate swaps. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio is 2.2 years (1.8 years). A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, negatively by approx. USD 16m and USD 18m, respectively (negatively by approx. USD 48m and USD 40m, respectively).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

SHARE PRICE RISK ON SHARES IN TOTAL S.A. The value of the shares in Total S.A. was USD 2,447m (level 1) on 31 December 2018. A 10% change in the share price will affect the Group's equity, excluding tax, positively/negatively by USD 245m. Changes in the share price will not affect the Group's profit, as value adjustments are recognised directly in equity (other comprehensive income). The shares are denominated in EUR and are measured at the EUR/USD spot rate. The underlying business of the shares is based on the USD. Dividends from these shares amount to USD 238m, of which USD 139m (USD 1m) pertains to shares held at the end of the year and USD 100m (USD 0m) pertains to shares sold during the year.
CREDIT RISK Trade receivables The Group has exposure to financial and commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.
A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S applies the simplified approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-due trade receivables have also been impaired.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTISED COST Other financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, finance lease receivables and other receivab les. These financial assets are considered to have low credit risk, and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have a low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Group's objective is to maintain a liquidity profile in line with an investment grade credit rating. Capital is managed for the Group. The equity share of total equity and liabilities was 59.0% at the end of 2018 (49.7%).

1 F or continuing businesses 2 Liquidity reserve is defined as undrawn committed revolving facilities with more than one year to expiry, securities
and cash and bank balances, excluding securities and balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions.

In addition to the liquidity reserve, the Group has USD 0.5bn undrawn committed loans which are dedicated to financing of specific assets, part of which will therefore only become available at certain times in the future.

Based on the liquidity reserve, loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory.

The average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about four years (about four years at 31 December 2017).

Financial risks, etc.
It is of great importance for the Group to maintain a financial reserve to cover the Group's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the Group's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
The flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things by focusing on the release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.

ACQUISITIONS DURING 2017 Hamburg Südamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft KG (Hamburg Süd) As of 1December 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Hamburg Süd including partnership shares in asset- owning companies (SPCs) owning vessels, newbuild contracts and containers connected hereto. Hamburg Süd is included in the consolidated financial reporting from 1December 2017.
The goodwill of USD 388m is primarily attributable to network synergies between Maersk Line and Hamburg Süd including its Brazilian subsidiary Aliança, and is not deductible for tax purposes. From the acquisition date to 31 December 2017, Hamburg Süd Group contributed with a revenue of USD 0.5bn, while the result was immaterial.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, the impact on Group revenue would have been USD 5.4bn (proforma), while the result would have increased by USD 0.1bn.
For 2017, the acquisition and integration costs amounted to USD 59m.
The accounting for the business combination is considered provisional at 31December 2017, as the acquisition was only completed on 1December 2017.
ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS Fair value measurement When applying the acquisition method of accounting, fair value assessments are made for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Determining fair values at the date of acquisition by nature requires management to apply estimates. Significant estimates are particularly applied in the valuation of vessels, containers, customer relationships, brands, finance lease obligations and unfavourable contracts. The inherent uncertainties in the fair value estimates may result in measurement adjustments in the 12 months following closing of the transaction. Goodwill has been assessed as recoverable at 31December 2017.
Acquired material net assets for which significant accounting estimates have been applied are recognised using the following valuation techniques:
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Customer relationships have been measured using the excess earnings method, in which the present value of future cash flows from recurring customers expected to be retained after the date of acquisition is valued. The main input value drivers are the estimated future retention rates and net cash flows of the acquired customer base. These have been estimated based on management's analysis of the acquired customer base, historical data and general business insights. The useful life of customer relationships is estimated at 15 years.
The fair value of brands has been measured using the relief from royalty method, in which management, based on an analysis, has assessed a royalty rate which an independent third party would charge for the use of the brands. Besides the royalty rate, the main input value driver is estimated future revenue. The useful life of brand names are estimated at 20 years.
The valuation of intangible assets reflects a market participant´s view, applying a discount rate of 9-10%.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Fair value of vessels and containers is measured using the market comparison method based on internally prepared valuations compared with external valuations.
FINANCIAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS The fair value of financial lease obligations has been measured using a discounted cash flow model in which the present value of the obligations has been determined based on the contractual future lease payments and an A.P. Moller - Maersk calculated borrowing rate.
UNFAVOURABLE CONTRACTS The fair value of unfavourable contracts is measured using the market comparison method based on the actual market rates for similar contracts.

Sales during 2018 No material external sales were performed during 2018. The sale of discontinued operations is disclosed in note 9.
Sales during 2017 In continuing operations, sales during 2017 primarily comprise Mercosul Line triggered by the Hamburg Süd acquisition, Pentalver in the UK, Dalian terminal in China and Zeebrugge terminal in Belgium. The sale of discontinued operations is disclosed in note 9.

Significant accounting policies

BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements for 2018 for A.P. Moller - Maersk have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The consolidated financial statements are also in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The consolidated financial statements of A.P. Moller - Maersk are included in the consolidated financial statements of A.P. Møller Holding A/S.
The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2017, except for the following areas:
·A.P. Moller - Maersk has changed its reportable segments. Comparative figures have been restated. ·A.P. Moller - Maersk has changed the presentation of the cash flow statement. Net financial payments are included
in cash flow from financing activities, and dividends received are included in cash flow from investing activities. These items were previously included in cash flow from operating activities. Comparative figures have been restated.
The effects of the changes on the cash flow statement are as follows:

USD million
Cash flow from operating activities Cash flow from investing activities Cash flow from financing activities

2018
+92 +439 -531

2017
+517 +213 -730

In addition, a number of changes to accounting standards are effective from 1 January 2018 and are endorsed by the EU. Those of relevance to A.P. Moller - Maersk are:
· Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15) · Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration (IFRIC 22) · Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (amendments to IFRS 2) · Annual Improvements 2014-2016 (amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28).
IFRS 15 ­ REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS A.P. Moller - Maersk's current practice for recognising revenue has been shown to comply, in all material aspects, with the concepts and principles encompassed by the new standard.
For IFRS 15, the modified retrospective approach has been applied which entails that any cumulative effects are recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and the comparison period has not been restated.
The other amendments encompass various guidance and clarifications which only affect disclosures.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview

New financial reporting requirements coming into effect after 31December 2018 are outlined in note 25:
CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that connection, relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control.
Joint arrangements are entities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk, according to contractual agreements with one or more other parties, has joint control. The arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.
Entities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered associated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.
Consolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, including the proportionate share of joint operations, part-owned vessels and pool arrangements, which have been prepared in accordance with A.P. Moller - Maersk's accounting policies. Intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, unless they indicate impairment.
Non-controlling interests' share of profit/loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates, and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from such translations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.
The functional currency varies from business area to business area. For A.P. Moller - Maersk's principal shipping activities, the functional currency is typically USD. This means, among other things, that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based container activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency of the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate. The functional currency of oil and oil-related business within discontinued operations is USD.

Financials Consolidated financial statements

Note 23 -- continued
Significant accounting policies

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
SEGMENT INFORMATION (NEW SEGMENT STRUCTURE) The allocation of business activities into segments reflects A.P. Moller - Maersk's character as an integrated container logistics business and is in line with the internal management reporting. The reportable segments are as follows:

Ocean

Global container shipping activities including strategic transhipment hubs

Logistics & Services

Freight forwarding, supply chain management, inland haulage and other logistics services

Terminals & Towage

Gateway terminal activities, towage and related marine activities

Manufacturing & Others Production of reefer and dry containers, trading and sale of bunker oil and other businesses

Operating segments have not been aggregated.
The reportable segments mainly comprise:
OCEAN Ocean activities, defined as operating activities under Maersk Line, Safmarine, Sealand ­ A Maersk Company and Hamburg Süd brands with 'Ocean container freight' being the main revenue stream. Ocean container freight is defined as the cost-per-weight measure of transporting goods on board a container vessel across the ocean, including demurrage and detention (D&D), terminal handling, documentation services, container services as well as container storage.
Hub activities, defined as operating activities under the APM Terminal brand generating revenue by providing port services only in major transhipment ports such as Rotterdam, Maasvlakte-II, Algeciras, Tangier, Tangier-Med II, Port Said, and joint ventures in Salalah, Tanjung Pelepas and Bremerhaven. The respective terminals are included under the Ocean segment, as the primary purpose of those ports is to provide transhipment services to Maersk's Ocean business, whereas third-party volumes sold in those locations are considered secondary.
LOGISTICS & SERVICES Damco activities, defined as all operating activities under the Damco brand, a provider of logistics, freight forwarding and supply chain management services.
Inland haulage activities (intermodal), defined as all operating activities under Maersk Line, Safmarine, Sealand ­ A Maersk Company brands with the main stream of revenue deriving from the transportation of containers from vendors (shippers) to the port of shipment, and from discharge port to the point of stripping (consignee) by truck and/or rail. Inland haulage activities operating under the Hamburg Süd brand are still part of the Ocean activity.

108 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million
APM Terminals inland activities, defined as operating activities in inland activities facilities fully or partially controlled by APM Terminals, with the main revenue stream being inland services such as full container storage, bonded warehousing, empty depot, local transportation, etc.
Trade Finance, a function providing export finance solutions, post-shipment and import finance solutions.
Star Air activities, operating cargo aircraft on behalf of UPS.
TERMINALS & TOWAGE Terminals activities, defined as operating activities in ports fully or partially controlled by the APM Terminals brand, with the main revenue stream being port activities not considered a hub activity as described above.
Towage activities, defined as all operating activities under the Svitzer brand, a provider of offshore towage and salvage services.
MANUFACTURING & OTHERS Maersk Container Industry, a container manufacturer that produces dry containers and reefer containers.
Maersk Oil Trading, dedicated to sourcing marine fuels and lubricants for A.P. Moller - Maersk's fleet in addition to refinery activities and sales to external parties including Maersk Tankers.
Hamburg Süd tramp activity, bulk and tanker activity acquired as part of the Hamburg Süd acquisition.
Other businesses, consisting of Maersk Training, a provider of training services to the maritime, oil and gas, offshore wind and crane industries.
The reportable segments do not comprise costs in A.P. Moller - Maersk's corporate functions. These functions are reported as unallocated items.
Revenue between segments is limited, except for the Terminals & Towage segment, where a large part of the services is delivered to the Ocean segment as well as the sale of containers from Maersk Container Industry to the Ocean segment. Sales of products and services between segments are based on market terms.
Maersk Oil, Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Service were classified as discontinued operations during 2017.
INCOME STATEMENT Revenue for all businesses is recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which happens upon the transfer of control to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services.
Revenue from shipping activities is recognised over time as the performance obligation is satisfied, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Detention and demurrage fees are

Financials Consolidated financial statements
Note 23 -- continued
Significant accounting policies
recognised over time up until the time of the customer´s late return or pick-up of containers. Retrospective volume rebates provided to certain customers which give rise to variable consideration are based on the expected value method and allocated to ocean freight revenue.
Revenue from terminal operations and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is recognised as revenue during the construction.
Revenue from most freight forwarding activities is recognised over time.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of control to the buyer.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term.
Share of profit/loss in associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments and their reversal.
Tax comprises an estimate of current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous years of those. Income tax is tax on taxable profits, and consists of corporation tax, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax on gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.
Earnings per share are calculated as the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' share of the profit/loss for the year divided by the number of shares (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding A.P. Moller - Maersk's holding of own shares. Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilution effect of share-based compensation issued by the parent company.
STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Other comprehensive income consists of income and costs not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustments of other equity investments (at FVOCI), cash flow hedges, forward points and currency basis spread as well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, etc. A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.
On disposal or discontinuation of an entity, A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a non-USD functional currency is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of equity instruments classified as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income will remain in equity upon disposal.
Other comprehensive income includes current and deferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million

BALANCE SHEET Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets regarding acquired customer relationships and brand names are amortised over a useful life of 15 and 20 years, respectively. IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.
For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of a grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.
Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:

Ships, etc. Containers, etc. Buildings Terminal infrastructure Plant and machinery, cranes and other terminal equipment Other operating equipment, fixtures, etc.

20-25 years 12 years 10-50 years 10-20 years or concession period, if shorter 5-20 years 3-7 years

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.
The cost of an asset is divided into separate components, which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the individual components differ. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.
The cost of assets constructed by A.P. Moller - Maersk includes directly attributable expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of removal and restoration.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units on acquisition and impaired before other assets.

109 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Financials Consolidated financial statements
Note 23 -- continued
Significant accounting policies
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use.
Assets are held for sale, when the carrying amount of an individual non-current asset, or disposal groups, will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Assets are classified as held for sale when activities to carry out a sale have been initiated, when the activities are available for immediate sale in their present condition and when the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities.
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell, and impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for sale. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale. Measurement of deferred tax and financial assets and liabilities is unchanged.
Lease contracts are classified as operating or finance leases at the inception of the lease. Once determined, the classification is not subsequently reassessed unless there are changes to the contractual terms. Contracts which transfer all significant risks and benefits associated with the underlying asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are treated as property, plant and equipment.
Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised as A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.
Equity instruments, etc., including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value, and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for nonlisted securities. Fair value adjustments from equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) remain in equity upon disposal. Dividends are recognised in the income statement.
Inventories mainly consist of bunker, containers (manufacturing), spare parts not qualifying for property, plant and equipment and other consumables. Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For loans and other receivables, write-down is made for anticipated losses based on specific individual or group assessments. For trade receivables, the loss allowance is measured in accordance with IFRS 9 applying a provision matrix to calculate the minimum impairment. The provision matrix includes an impairment for non-due receivables.
Equity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit/loss for the year and other comprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview
Amounts in USD million
The translation reserve comprises A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising on translation from functional currency into presentation currency. The reserve for other equity investments comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of equity investments (at FVOCI), net of tax. Reserve for hedges includes the accumulated fair value of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, net of tax as well as forward points and currency basis spread.
Equity-settled performance shares, restricted shares and share options allocated to the executive employees of A.P. Moller - Maersk as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at estimated fair value at the grant date and a corresponding adjustment in equity. Cash-s ettled performance awards allocated to employees below executive levels as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's long-term incentive programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period and a corresponding adjustment in other payables.
At the end of each reporting period, A.P. Moller - Maersk revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. Any impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity and other payables.
Provisions are recognised when A.P. Moller - Maersk has a present legal or constructive obligation from past events. The item includes, among other things, legal disputes, provisions for onerous contracts, unfavourable contracts acquired as part of a business combination as well as provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the US. Provisions are recognised based on best estimates, and are discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settlement is reasonably determinable.
Pension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling requirements. Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated with the same rates as used for discounting the obligations. Actuarial gains/losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Pension plans where A.P. Moller - Maersk, as part of collective bargaining agreements, participates together with other enterprises ­ so called multi-employer plans ­ are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. For defined benefit multi-employer plans where sufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting is not available, the plans are treated as defined contribution plans.
Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, where at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a business combination. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when A.P. Moller - Maersk controls the timing of dividends, and no taxable dividends are currently expected. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.

Financials Consolidated financial statements
Note 23 -- continued
Significant accounting policies
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans subject to fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged interest component. Liabilities in respect of finance leases are measured at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable to determine, or else at A.P. Moller - Maersk's incremental borrowing rate.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.
The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge highly probable future transactions is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised. At that time, the accumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised. The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that can be attributed to the hedging relationship. Currency basis spread and forward points are considered a cost of hedging and deferred in equity.
The ineffective portion of hedge transactions and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for interest and currency-based instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.
CASH FLOW STATEMENT Cash flow from operating activities includes all cash transactions other than cash flows arising from investments and divestments, received dividends, principal payments of loans, instalments on finance lease liabilities, paid and received financial items and equity transactions. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is considered as a non-cash item, and the actual payments of these borrowing costs are included in cash flow from financing.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities form an integral part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's cash management.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES Upon acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the date when control was achieved using the acquisition method. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can otherwise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and any subsequent changes to contingent consideration are recognised as other income or other costs in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million
When A.P. Moller - Maersk ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is re-measured at fair value, and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as a gain (or loss) on the sale of non-current assets. The difference between sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the subsidiary is recognised in the income statement including fair value of contingent consideration at the time of sale. Contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement.
The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement with restatement of comparative figures. Assets and liabilities held for sale from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet with no restatement of comparative figures. Elimination between continuing and discontinued operations is presented to reflect continuing operations as post-separation, which entails the elimination of interest, borrowing, dividends and capital increases.
Assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale except financial assets, etc., are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less cost to sell, and impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for sale. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated.
In addition to the above general accounting policies, the following are significant about discontinued operations.
For drilling activities, revenue is recognised in accordance with the agreed day rates for the work performed to date. Compensations received, or receivable, for early termination are recognised as revenue with deferral of an estimated value of any obligations to stand ready for new engagements in the remaining contract period.
Oil and gas revenue is recognised as revenue upon discharge from the production site, reflecting the production entitlement quantities. In agreements where tax is settled in oil, an amount corresponding to the sales value is recognised as both revenue and tax.
Income tax also consists of oil tax based on gross measures. Oil tax on gross measures is a special tax in certain countries on the production of hydrocarbons and is separately disclosed within tax.
Intangible assets regarding acquired oil resources (concession rights, etc.) are amortised over a useful life of production until the fields' expected production periods end ­ a period of up to 20 years until classification as assets held for sale.
In property, plant and equipment, oil production facilities, where oil is received as payment for the investment (cost oil), depreciation generally takes place concurrently with the receipt of cost oil until classification as assets held for sale.

The cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of abandonment. Annual impairment tests are not carried out for oil concession rights within the scope of IFRS 6. The useful lives of new assets are 25 years for rigs and up to 20 years for oil and gas production facilities, etc. ­ based on the expected production periods of the fields. Provisions includes provisions for the abandonment of oil fields.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview
Amounts in USD million
Note 24
Significant accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management, on an ongoing basis, to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its judgements and estimates based on historical experience, independent advice and external data points as well as in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute those plans or to settle claims that are raised against A.P. Moller - Maersk, is highly uncertain. Therefore, assumptions may change or the outcome may differ in the coming years, which could require a material upward or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. This note includes the areas in which A.P. Moller - Maersk is particularly exposed to a material adjustment of the carrying amounts as at the end of 2018.
GENERAL Aspects of uncertainty In its assumption setting, management deals with different aspects of uncertainty. One aspect of uncertainty is whether an asset or liability exists where the assessment forms the basis for recognition or derecognition decisions, including assessment of control. Another aspect is the measurement uncertainty, where management makes assumptions about the value of the assets and liabilities that are deemed to exist. These assumptions concern the timing and amount of future cash flows and the risks inherent in these.
Container freight rates The future development in container freight rates is an uncertain and significant factor impacting especially Maersk Line, whose financial results are directly affected by fluctuations in container freight rates. Freight rates are influenced by the global economic environment and trade patterns, as well as by industry-specific trends in respect of capacity supply and demand. In addition, the new global low sulphur bunker fuel regulation (IMO 2020) which comes into effect in January 2020 is expected to increase the cost of compliant fuels significantly. Alternatively, installing scrubbers on vessels will enable the use of today's lower cost fuels but will instead require substantial capital expenditure. There is significant uncertainty that the increased cost regarding implementation and compliance with the IMO 2020 requirements cannot be recovered from customers through the freight rate.
Oil prices The future development in the oil price is an uncertain and significant factor impacting accounting estimates across A.P. Moller - Maersk either directly or indirectly. Maersk Line is directly impacted by the price of bunker oil, where the competitive landscape determines the extent to which the development is reflected in the freight rates charged to the customer. APM Terminals is indirectly impacted by the oil price as terminals located in oil-producing countries, e.g. Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Russia and Brazil, are indirectly impacted by the development in oil prices and the consequences on the countries' economies, which not only affects volume handled in the terminals, but also exchange rates.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT A.P. Moller - Maersk carries goodwill of USD 645m (USD 723m) and intangible assets with indefinite lives of USD 34m (USD 34m). The majority of non-current assets are amortised over their useful economic lives.
Management assesses impairment indicators across this asset base. Judgement is applied in the definition of cash- generating units and in the selection of methodologies and assumptions for impairment tests.

Financials Consolidated financial statements
Note 24 -- continued
Significant accounting estimates and judgements

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million

The determination of cash-generating units differs for the various businesses. Ocean operates its fleet of container vessels, containers and hub terminals in an integrated network, for which reason the Ocean activities are tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit. In addition, the intermodal activities reported under Logistics & Services are included in the Ocean cash-generating unit for impairments testing to apply consistency between he asset base and related cash flows. In Logistics & Services, apart from Intermodal, each entity is defined as a cash-generating unit. In gateway terminals, each terminal is considered individually in impairment tests, except when the capacity is managed as a portfolio, which is the case for certain terminals in Northern Europe and Global Ports Investments (Russia). Towage groups vessels according to type, size, etc. in accordance with the structure governing management's ongoing follow-up. Projected cash flow models are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair value is deemed lower than value in use. External data is used to the extent possible, and centralised processes, involving corporate functions, ensure that indexes or data sources are selected consistently while observing differences in risks and other circumstances. Current market values for vessels, etc. are estimated using acknowledged brokers.
IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATIONS In Ocean, although freight rates improved compared to 2017, it was not enough to compensate for the 32% increase in average bunker cost, the continuing low freight rates and an historical inability in the industry to recoup cost due to increased bunker costs are impairment indicators. In addition, the estimated fair value of the fleet continues to be significantly lower than the carrying amount. Consequently, an estimate of the recoverable amount has been prepared by a value in use calculation. The cash flow projection is based on forecasts as perDecember 2018 covering plans for 2019-23. The key sensitivities are: development in freight rates, container volumes, bunker costs, effect of cost savings as well as the discount rate. Management has applied an assumption of growth in volumes and continued pressure on, but increasing freight rates, and continued cost efficiency. The impairment test continues to show headroom from value in use to the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable.
In Terminals & Towage, the decline in activity in oil-producing countries is an impairment indicator for the terminals in these countries. Management assesses impairment triggers, and based on these estimate recoverable amounts on the individual terminals. For APM Terminals' interest in Global Port Investments, being the share of equity and significant intangible assets acquired, management assesses the recoverable amount of its interest on an ongoing basis. Uncertain variables in the estimate are the economic outlook in Russia, local competition, effect on volume, operating expenses and discount rate. The carrying amount of the investment may not be sustainable in the next few years if markets develop significantly adversely compared to current expectations. Estimates of recoverable amounts were also prepared for other terminals where decreasing volumes triggered impairment tests. Key sensitivities are: expected volumes, local port rates, concession right extensions as well as discount rate. An impairment of USD 20m was recognised in 2018 compared to USD 621m in 2017 related to terminals in markets with challenging commercial conditions. Continued economic deterioration and a lack of cash repatriation opportunities in certain oil-producing countries can potentially put further pressure on carrying amounts of terminals in these countries.
Maersk Container Industry decided to consolidate the manufacture of reefer containers at the facility in Qingdao, China, and exit the dry container business completely. Consequently, operation ceased at the facility in San Antonio, Chile, in Q2 and Dongguan, China, in Q4 2018, as it was announced in early 2019 that the factory would not reopen after a planned idle period. In addition to restructuring costs of USD 18m with effect on EBITDA, the closing in Chile resulted in writing down of assets of USD 141m including write-down of inventories. The closure in China resulted in a write-down of assets of USD 66m.

The recoverable amounts for both factories are measured at fair value categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as measurements are not based on observable market data and relate mainly to land and buildings which by nature are uncertain.
Reference is made to notes 6 and 7 for information about impairment losses, recoverable amounts and discount rates.
Amortisation, depreciation and residual values Useful lives are estimated based on experience. Management decides from time to time to revise the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development and environmental requirements. Please refer to note 23 for the useful lives typically used for new assets.
Residual values are difficult to estimate given the long lives of vessels and rigs, the uncertainty as to future economic conditions and the future price of steel, which is considered the main determinant of the residual price. Generally, the residual values of vessels are initially estimated at 10% of the purchase price excluding dry-docking costs. The longterm view is prioritised to disregard, to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations which may be significant.
OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO REPATRIATING SURPLUS CASH A.P. Moller - Maersk operates worldwide, and in this respect, has operations in countries where access to repatriating surplus cash is limited. In these countries, management makes judgements as to how these transactions and balance sheet items are recognised in the financial statements.
PROVISIONS FOR PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS For defined benefit schemes, management makes assumptions about future remuneration and pension changes, employee attrition rates, life expectancy, inflation and discount rates. When setting these assumptions, management takes advice from the actuaries performing the valuation. The inflation and discount rates are determined centrally for the major plans on a country-by-country basis. All other assumptions are determined on a plan-by-plan basis. Refer to note 13 for information about key assumptions and the sensitivity of the liability to changes in these assumptions.
Plan assets are measured at fair value by fund administrators.
PROVISIONS FOR LEGAL DISPUTES, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, ETC. Management's estimate of the provisions regarding legal disputes, including disputes on taxes and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. The resolution of legal disputes, through either negotiations or litigation, can take several years to complete and the outcome is subject to considerable uncertainty.
A.P. Moller - Maersk is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of varying scope. Appropriate provisions have been made where the probability of payment of additional taxes in individual cases is considered more likely than not. Claims, for which the probability of payment is assessed by management to be less than 50%, are not provided for. Such risks are instead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area, and country risk provisions are established where the aggregated risk of additional payments is more likely than not.

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS Judgement has been applied in the measurement of deferred tax assets with respect to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ability to utilise the assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets recognised in entities having suffered an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 142m (USD 206m) for continuing operations, excluding entities participating in joint taxation schemes. These assets mainly relate to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated during the construction of terminals, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or are expected within a foreseeable future.
ASSESSMENT OF CONTROL, JOINT CONTROL OR SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE A.P. Moller - Maersk's control, joint control or significant influence over an entity or activity is subject to an assessment of power and exposure to variability in returns.
The assessment of control in oil and gas activities entails an analysis of the status of operators in joint arrangements. Operators are responsible for the daily management of the activities carried out within the jointly established framework. Since operators are not exposed to, and have no right to, returns beyond the participating share, and since they can be replaced by agreement, the operators are regarded as agents as defined in IFRS 10. Operators of pool arrangements in shipping are similarly assessed.
When assessing joint control, an analysis is carried out to determine which decisions require unanimity and whether these concerns the activities that significantly affect the returns. Joint control is deemed to exist when business plans, work programmes and budgets are unanimously adopted. Within oil and gas activities, an assessment of joint control is carried out for each phase. These are typically exploration and development, production and decommissioning. Unanimity is often not required during the production phase. Given that the contracting parties have direct and unrestricted rights and obligations in the arrangements' assets or liabilities regardless of voting rights, the arrangements are accounted for as joint operations during all phases.
For pool arrangements in shipping, unanimity is not required in decisions on relevant activities. However, the contracting parties have direct and unrestricted rights and obligations in the unit's assets or liabilities, and as the pool arrangements are not structured into separate legal entities, they are treated as joint operations.
LEASING Judgement is applied in the classification of leasing as operating or finance leasing. A.P. Moller - Maersk enters into a substantial amount of lease contracts, some of which are combined leasing and service contracts such as time charter agreements.
Management applies a formalised process for the classification and estimation of present values for finance leases using specialist staff in corporate functions.

VALUATION OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS When classifying a disposal group as assets held for sale, management applies judgement to the estimated fair value of the disposal group. Depending on the disposal group's activity, assets and liabilities, the estimated value is encompassed by different levels of uncertainty and thus subsequent adjustments are possible. Measurement of the fair value of the disposal group is categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as measurement is not based on observable market data.
According to IFRS 5, discontinued operations are valued at fair value less cost to sell.
A.P. Moller - Maersk has decided to pursue a listing of Maersk Drilling via a demerger in April 2019. In Q3 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk recognised a positive fair value adjustment of USD 445m in relation to Maersk Drilling following an improved outlook for market fundamentals as well as higher oil prices and share prices of listed peers. Following the positive fair value adjustment, the invested capital of Maersk Drilling was USD 5.0bn. Fair value was primarily based on an external valuation indicating a range for Maersk Drilling's enterprise value. The valuation was based on a combination of several valuation methodologies. Based on the valuation received management has applied judgement to the recognised fair value of Maersk Drilling.
During Q4 2018, the oil price has decreased from above 80 USD/bbl to below 55 USD/bbl at the end of the year and share prices of listed peers have likewise decreased significantly. Consequently, management has reviewed new updated valuations of Maersk Drilling. Based on the review and given that the long-term business fundamentals have not changed, management maintains its fair value assessment of an enterprise value of USD 5.0bn. This is within the range indicated by the new external valuations.
The range indicates uncertainty in regard to assessing the fair value of Maersk Drilling. A fair value adjustment at listing in April 2019 will be recognised in the income statement as part of Profit/loss for the period ­ discontinuing operations.
In Q3 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk recognised a negative fair value adjustment of USD 400m in relation to Maersk Supply Service to reflect management's revised expectations of a fair value of the business based on received external value indications and in line with trading levels of listed peers.. The fair value of Maersk Supply Service recognised at 31December is USD 0.7bn. The fair value estimate for Maersk Supply Service is subject to significant uncertainties given the overcapacity in the off-shore markets which is keeping day rates at a continued low level in addition to the limited number of transactions in the offshore business.

New financial reporting requirements
The following new accounting standards are relevant to the Group for the years commencing from 1 January 2019. A.P. Moller - Maersk has not yet applied the following standards:
· IFRS 16 Leases. · IFRIC 23 Uncertain tax positions.
A.P. Moller - Maersk has in all material aspects, concluded analyses of the impending changes resulting from IFRS 16 and IFRIC 23. The key findings are explained below:
IFRS 16 LEASES Effective 1 January 2019, APMM applied the new reporting standard on Leases, IFRS 16 according to the adoption date stipulated by the International Accounting Standards Board, IASB. Post transition, leases will be recognised as a rightof-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by APMM.
Each lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the liability and an interest expense. The interest expense is charged to the income statement over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset´s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
APMM has transitioned to IFRS 16 in accordance with the modified retrospective approach, therefore previous period comparative figures will not be adjusted. Additionally, the definition of a lease under IAS 17 and its related interpretations has been retained. Leases classified as finance leases at 31December 2018 have been transitioned to IFRS 16 at their carrying amount of USD 2.3bn.
At 31December 2018, APMM had non-cancellable operating lease commitments for continuing operations of USD 12.0bn (USD 12.0bn). As part of the transition, APMM applied the following adjustments before discounting lease payments:
·Service components included in the pricing of vessel charter fees are not included as part of the lease liability. These costs will be recognised in the income statement as incurred.
·Terminal concession agreements to which APMM is committed, but which will only begin operations during Q1 2019 or later, are not capitalised at transition.
·APMM will not apply the new standard to leases with a remaining term of 12 months or less from 1 January 2019. Additionally, leases with a maximum lease term of less than 12 months are exempted from the provisions of the new standard.
After adjustments and discounting effect the lease liability is estimated at approx. USD 6.0bn. In discounting the future lease payments incremental borrowing rates of 1.6%-11.1% have been applied for the significant leasing contracts. In Q1 2019, the Group will present a bridge between the lease commitments and the lease liability.
The new requirement to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability has a significant impact on the presentation of APMM's gross debt and profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses (EBITDA).

Consolidated financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million
APMM's gross debt is estimated to increase by approx. USD 6.0bn to USD 17.9bn, while property, plant and equipment increases to approx. USD 36.2bn. Operating expenses are estimated to decrease, positively impacting EBITDA by USD 1.2bn in comparison to the previous lease standard IAS 17. The cost related to operating leases will be recognised as depreciation, negatively impacting profit before financial items (EBIT) and interest cost, negatively impacting profit before tax. IFRIC 23 UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS A.P. Moller - Maersk follows most of the guidelines in IFRIC 23 for accounting for uncertain income tax positions and the implementation of the interpretation standard is not expected to result in a significant change to the net amount of tax provisions. The recognition in the balance sheet will change as A.P. Moller - Maersk currently recognises uncertain tax positions under provisions, whereas from 2019 these will be recognised as current and deferred tax.

Subsequent events
On 21 February 2019, the Board of Directors has decided to initiate the separation of the drilling activities through a demerger. The shares in Maersk Drilling Holding A/S (Maersk Drilling) and its subsidiaries as well as certain other assets and liabilities will be contributed to a new company with the legal name ´The Drilling Company of 1972 A/S´. The Board of Directors intends to propose the demerger for approval by the shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S at the Annual General Meeting on 2 April 2019.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the shares in Maersk Drilling will be distributed to A.P. Moller - Maersk shareholders with anticipated first day of trading on 4 April 2019. The A.P. Moller - Maersk Board of Directors intends to propose a single share class structure for Maersk Drilling with the new listed shares being distributed on a pro-rata basis based on the nominal value of the shares in A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S. Shareholders will receive one share in Maersk Drilling per nominal A.P. Moller - Maersk DKK 500 share and two shares in Maersk Drilling per nominal A.P. Moller - Maersk DKK 1,000 share.

Note 9
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
The parent company transferred the oil and gas activities in the Danish sector of the North Sea and four drilling rigs to fully-owned subsidiaries in 2017. As a result, these activities have been reclassified as discontinued operations. The reclassification reflects the ongoing process on separation of the energy-related businesses from A.P. Moller - Maersk. The activities were transferred at carrying value of the net assets, hence the transfers did not result in any gains/ losses.
Shares in the subsidiaries Maersk Drilling Holding A/S and Maersk Supply Service A/S are furthermore presented as assets held for sale, measured at fair value less cost to sell. Reference is made to note 24 in the consolidated financial statements regarding "valuation of discontinued operations".
Shares in Mærsk Olie og Gas A/S were sold to Total S.A. in 2018, cf. note 3.

EQUITY-SETTLED INCENTIVE PLANS (EXCLUDING SHARE OPTIONS PLAN) A.P. Moller - Maersk has two different equity-settled incentive plans. The restricted shares plan was introduced in 2013 and grants have been awarded to employees on a yearly basis since 2013. Beginning in 2018, grants have also been awarded to members of the Executive Board. In 2014, the Group established a three-year performance shares plan for members of the Executive Board and other employees. The performance shares plan lapsed in 2017.
The transfer of restricted shares is contingent upon the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the time of granting. For members of the Executive Board, the vesting period is five years.
The members of the Executive Board as well as other employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc. A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in connection with the restricted shares plan.

Share-based payment
The fair value of restricted shares (A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S B shares) granted to 105 (132) employees and five members of the Executive Board was USD 8m (USD 8m) at the time of grant. The total value of granted restricted shares recognised in the income statement is USD 1m (USD 1m).
The fair value per restricted share at the time of grant was DKK 9,273 (DKK 11,550), which is equal to the volume- weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 1 April 2018.
On 1 April 2018, the restricted shares originally granted in 2015 were settled with the employees. The weighted average share price at that date was DKK 9,273.
The average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2018 is 1.4 years (1.3 years).
CASH-SETTLED INCENTIVE PLAN In 2015, A.P. Moller - Maersk introduced the performance shares plan to a broader range of employees. The actual settlement of the awards is contingent upon the degree of certain financial goals being achieved, the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination at the date of settlement. This means that the number of awards that eventually will vest may be adjusted during the vesting period. Depending on the agreement, the settlement will take place two or three years after the initial granting and the employee may have the option to settle the awards in shares.
The employees are not entitled to any dividend during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.

The hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relation between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where cost of hedging is applied, the forward points and change in basis spread are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. Cost of hedging reserve amounts to USD 1m (USD 6m).
For information about risk management strategy, currencies, maturities, etc. reference is made to note 16.
HEDGE OF BORROWINGS Cross-currency swaps are used to swap all non-USD issued bonds. Fixed to floating rate swaps are designated as a combination of fair value and cash flow hedges. The principal amounts in USD equivalents hereof are: EUR 1,723m (EUR 1,835m), GBP 89m (GBP 95m), JPY 204m (JPY 200m) and NOK 252m (NOK 268m). The remaining swaps are fixedto-fixed rate or floating-to-fixed rate swaps and are designated as cash flow hedges of currency and interest risk.
The hedge ratio is 1:1. The maturity of the hedge instrument 0-5 years in USD equivalents are: EUR 1,746m (EUR 3,419m), JPY 91m (JPY 89m) and NOK 344m (NOK 244m). 5-10 years: EUR 859m (EUR 0m), GBP 380m (GBP 405m), JPY 113m (JPY 111m) and NOK 252m (NOK 390m). Above 10 years: EUR 92m (EUR 96m).
Cross-currency swaps are designated as a combination of hedge of principal cash flows and hedge of interests at a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% (3.7%).
Interest rate swaps are all denominated in USD and pays floating interest. The hedge ratio is 1:1 and the weighted average interest rate excluding margin on loan is 2.8% (3.4%). The maturity of the interest rate swaps 5-10 years USD 500m (USD 500m).
For cash flow hedges related to borrowings, loss of USD 64m (gain of USD 32m) is recognised at other comprehensive income and the cash flow hedges reserve is loss of USD 33m (gain of USD 32m) excluding tax effect. Reference is made to other comprehensive income.
The carrying amount of the borrowings in fair value hedge relation is USD 2,768m (USD 3,069m) and the accumulated fair value adjustment of the loans is loss of USD 13m (loss of USD 28m). The loss on the hedging instrument in fair value hedges recognised in the income statement for the year amounts to USD 15m (loss of USD 33m) and the gain on hedged item amounts to USD 15m (gain USD 33m).
Due to bond buy-back in 2018, the ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is recognised in profit or loss at USD 20m in 2018.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME After disposal of the remaining 19% share in Dansk Supermarked Group in 2017, the company holds no material equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).
With the sale of Mærsk Olie og Gas A/S to Total S.A., the company received 97.5m shares in Total S.A. equivalent to an ownership interest of 3.7%. The market value of the Total S.A. shares was USD 5.6bn on closing 8 March 2018. In June 2018, the shares were transferred in a non-cash transaction to the subsidiary Maersk Oil Trading and Investments A/S. Market value on the transfer date was USD 5.9bn and the gain for the company is included in other comprehensive income. Dividends recognised during the ownership period amount to USD 146m.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE Financial instruments measured at fair value can be divided into three levels: Level 1-- Q uoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2-- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability;
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); Level 3-- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value of listed shares falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the company's profit or equity significantly.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST Fair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
Fair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on discounted interests and instalments.

Note 16
Financial risks, etc.

Parent company financial statements--notes overview Amounts in USD million

The company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the company's financial performance. The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the company's business units.
MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The below sensitivity analyses relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2018.
The sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2018. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
The sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit or loss and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rate.
CURRENCY RISK The company's currency risk arises primarily from its treasury activities where financing is obtained and provided in a wide range of currencies other than USD such as EUR, GBP and NOK.
The main purpose of hedging the company's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the company's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the company's profit. The company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:
·Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon; ·Significant capital commitments in other currencies than USD are hedged; ·Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on asset-liability match and the currency of the generated
cash flow.
An increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the company is exposed is estimated to have a negative impact on the company's profit before tax of USD 0.1bn (negative impact of USD 0.1bn) and a negative impact on the company's equity, excluding tax, of USD 0.1bn (negative impact of USD 0.1bn). The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date, cf. note 14 and 15, and are thus not an expression of the company's total currency risk.

Note 16 -- continued
Financial risks, etc.
INTEREST RATE RISK The company has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, GBP, JPY and NOK. Some loans are at fixed interest rates, while others are at floating interest rates.
The company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. The hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a duration range and is primarily obtained with interest rate swaps.
A general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all other things being equal, to have an effect on profit before tax and equity, excluding tax by USD 0.2bn (USD 0.0bn).
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

CREDIT RISK The company has substantial exposure to financial and commercial counterparties, but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.
Financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, finance lease receivables and other receivables. These are all considered to have low credit risk and thus the impairment provision calculated basis of 12-month expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S applies the simple approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, also non-due trade receivables have been impaired.
Other financial assets at amortised cost include loans to subsidiaries. As of 31 December 2018, the loans amount to USD 23.2bn and are considered to have a low credit risk, thus the impairment provision to be recognised during the period is limited to 12-month expected losses. The credit risk has not increased significantly since the initial recognition and is considered low based on the investment grade credit rating for the group and consequently the financial strength of the major subsidiaries within the Group. Loans to Maersk Supply Service A/S and Maersk Container Industry A/S were in total written down with USD 0.2bn.

Contingent liabilities
As part of the divestment of Mærsk Olie og Gas A/S to Total S.A., the company has assumed a secondary liability related to the decommissioning of the offshore facilities in Denmark by issuance of a declaration. The company assesses the risk of economic outflows due to this secondary liability as very remote.
Reference is made to note 9 in the consolidated financial statements for full description.
Guarantees amount to USD 0.5bn (USD 0.8bn). Of this, USD 0.5bn (USD 0.8bn) is related to subsidiaries. The guarantees are not expected to be realised, but they can mature within one year.
Except for customary agreements within the company's activities, no material agreements have been entered that will take effect, change or expire upon changes of the control over the company.
The company is involved in a number of legal disputes. The company is also involved in tax disputes in certain countries. Some of these involve significant amounts and are subject to considerable uncertainty.
Tax may crystallise on repatriation of dividends. Through participation in joint taxation scheme with A.P. Møller Holding A/S, the company is jointly and severally liable for taxes payable, etc. in Denmark.

Independent Auditor's Report
To the shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.

Our opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements (pages 67-140 and 152-154) give a true and fair view of the Group's and the parent company's financial position at 31December 2018 and of the results of the Group's and the parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1January to 31December 2018 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Our opinion is consistent with our Auditor's Long-form Report to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
What we have audited
The consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the financial year

1January to 31 December 2018 comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies for the Group as well as for the parent company. Collectively referred to as the "financial statements".
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.
Appointment
We were first appointed auditors of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S on 12April 2012 for the financial year 2012. We have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of seven years including the financial year 2018.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for 2018. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

142 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S|Annual Report 2018

Financials Independent Auditor's Report

Revenue recognition Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recognition of revenue is complex due to the volume of transactions and the extent of different revenue streams within the segments.
We focused on this area, as recognition of revenue involves accounting policy decisions, including assessment of IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers", and judgements made by Management originating from different customer behavior, market conditions, terms and nature of services in the various segments. Further, the volume of transactions and extent of different revenue streams require various IT setups of revenue recognition, which are complex and introduce an inherent risk to the revenue recognition process.

Our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with applicable accounting standards, including adoption of IFRS 15.
We tested the relevant controls, including applicable information systems and Management's monitoring of controls, used to ensure the completeness, accuracy and timing of revenue recognised.
We performed substantive procedures over invoicing and significant contracts in order to assess the accounting treatment and principles applied, and tested journal entries on revenue.

Reference is made to notes 1 and 23 in the consolidated financial statements.

R ecoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

The principal risk is in relation to Management's assessment of future timing and amount of cash flows, which are used to project the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets. Bearing in mind the generally long-lived nature of assets, the most critical assumptions are Management's view on discount rate and the long-term outlook for freight rates and volumes, bunker price as well as terminal volumes and revenue per container move.
We focused on this area, as Management is required to exercise considerable judgement because of the inherent complexity in determining the discount rate, estimating future cash flows and defining appropriate cash generating units (CGUs).
Reference is made to notes 6, 7 and 24 in the consolidated financial statements.

In addressing the risk, we walked through and tested the controls designed and operated relating to the assessment of the carrying value of property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets. We considered the appropriateness of Management defined CGUs within the businesses. We also tested Management's process for identifying CGUs that required impairment testing in line with IFRS and tested that all assets requiring impairment testing were identified.
We examined the methodology used by Management to assess the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets assigned to CGUs, to determine its compliance with accounting standards and consistency of application.
We examined Management's impairment trigger assessments and performed detailed testing for the assets where a need for an impairment review was identified. We assessed the reasonableness of key assumptions in relation to the ongoing operation of the assets. We corroborated Management's estimate of future cash flows and challenged whether these were appropriate in light of key assumptions, such as freight and terminal rates, volume growth and capital expenditures, including assessed Management's macroe conomic assumptions. With the assistance of our valuation experts, we independently calculated the discount rate. In calculating the discount rate, the key inputs used were independently sourced from market data, and we assessed the methodology applied. We compared the discount rate used by Management to our calculated rate. We tested the mathematical accuracy of the relevant value-in-use models prepared by Management.

Estimation in respect of uncertain tax positions

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

When operating in a complex multi national tax environment, and with open tax audits and inquiries with tax authorities, Management is required to exercise considerable judgement when determining the appropriate amount to provide in respect of uncertain tax positions.
We focused on this area, as the amounts involved are potentially material and the valuation of tax assets and liabilities is associated with uncertainty and judgement. At 31December 2018, provisions are recognised in respect of legal disputes etc., which among other things include tax, indirect tax and duty disputes.

We evaluated relevant procedures and controls regarding completeness of records of uncertain tax positions and Management's procedure for estimating the provision for uncertain tax positions.
In understanding and evaluating Management's judgements, we considered the status of recent and current tax authority audits and enquiries, the outcome of previous claims, judgmental positions taken in tax returns and current year estimates and developments in the tax environment.
In addition, we used our tax specialists where applicable, and evaluated and challenged the adequacy of Management's key assumptions and read correspondence with tax authorities to assess Management's estimates.

Reference is made to notes 8, 14, 19 and 24 in the consolidated financial statements.

Statement on Directors' report
Management is responsible for Directors' report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover Directors' report, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read Directors' report and, in doing so, consider whether Directors' report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, we considered whether Directors' report includes the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on the work we have performed, in our view, Directors' report is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement in Directors' report.

Management's responsibilities for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

144 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S|Annual Report 2018

Financials Independent Auditor's Report

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: · Identify and assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the parent company's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor's Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the

Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our Auditor's Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

For the continuing operations, A.P. Moller - Maersk reported a revenue of USD 10.2bn, equal to growth of 21% (9% adjusted for Hamburg Süd) compared to Q4 2017. EBITDA was USD 1.1bn (USD 844m), positively impacted by the inclusion of Hamburg Süd and growth in gateway terminals, partly offset by integration and restructuring costs in Ocean and restructuring cost in Logistics & Services, as well as cost increases in gateway terminals. Cash flow from operating activities was USD 1.4bn (USD 1.1bn), equal to a cash conversion of 121% (116%) and gross CAPEX was reduced by 37% to USD 587m.

Ocean
Revenue increased by 22% to USD 7.3bn (USD 6.0bn), driven by 12% increase in volumes to 3,353k FFE (3,007k FFE), primarily related to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd from 1 December 2017. The average freight rate increased by 9.3% to 1,913 USD/FFE (1,750 USD/FFE).
The volumes excluding Hamburg Süd dec reased by 1.1%, driven by a backhaul volume reduction of 3.5%, while headhaul volumes were on par.

The decline was below the estimated market growth of around 4% due to strong Q4 2017 volumes following the cyber-attack in Q3 2017 along with a focus on improving margins in the second half of 2018, demonstrated by the freight rate development and uplift in EBITDA.
The increase in the average freight rate of 9.3% was driven by East-West trades, which increased 15%, partly supported by the pre- tariff rush seen on the transpacific trades from China to the US. North-South freight rates grew by 6.4%, while the Intra-regional trades increased by 14%. The inclusion of Hamburg Süd affected the average freight rates positively due to Hamburg Süd's different trade mix compared to Maersk Line, especially on the Intra-regional trades. The increase was also partly due to the impact of the emergency bunker surcharge. Excluding Hamburg Süd, the average freight rate increased by 7.0%. The average freight rate decreased by 0.8% compared to Q3 2018, driven by the usual seasonal fluctuations in freight rates.

CAPEX1 2017 692 25 212 7 2 938

Other revenue amounted to USD 938m (USD 734m), mainly driven by higher demurrage and detention.
Unit cost at fixed bunker price at 1,776 USD/ FFE decreased 1.8% compared to Q3 2018. The decline was partly driven by the usual seasonality in unit costs, partly due to year-end rebates. Compared to Q4 2017, unit cost at fixed bunker increased 1.9% without adjusting for rate of exchange and development in Hamburg Süd portfolio mix effects. The increase was mainly driven by the decline in

Additional information Highlights Q4 2018

volumes excluding Hamburg Süd, and further driven by a focus on margin improvement. Schedule reliability was below the level from Q4 2017, but on a par with last quarter. Utilisation slightly declined versus Q3, but improved compared to last year. Additionally, average nominal capacity of 4,038k TEU was in line with the 4m TEU ambition.
Total unit cost at 2,001 USD/FFE (1,878 USD/FFE) was 6.5% higher than in Q4 2017. The increase was negatively impacted by a 35% increase in the average bunker price. The total bunker cost was USD 1.3bn (USD 1.0bn), of which the bunker price drove an increase of USD 347m (103 USD/FFE), while the remainder was from higher consumption due to the inclusion of Hamburg Süd. The total consumption was, however, positively impacted by a 9.5% improvement in bunker efficiency of 849 kg/FFE (939 kg/FFE).
Port moves per hour in hub terminals of 83.7 was 11% higher than in Q4 2017, and a 1.1% improvement since Q3. Operational synergies between the hub terminals and Maersk Liner Business drove the improvements along with efficiency initiatives materialising. Salalah and Maasvlakte II improved the most since Q4 2017.
EBITDA ended at USD 927m, which is an increase of 50% compared to Q4 2017. The EBITDA margin was 12.7% (10.3%), and improved 0.1 percentage point compared to Q3 2018. Profitability increased compared to the same period last year, despite an increase of the unit cost at fixed bunker,

partly on the back of the margin focus in Q3 and Q4 2018.
Hamburg Süd contributed with volumes of 586k FFE and a pro forma EBITDA of USD 204m versus 148m in Q3 2018. Integration costs amounted to USD 22m in Q4 2018.
Logistics & Services
Revenue increased by USD 30m to USD 1.6bn (USD 1.5bn), mainly supported by higher volumes in intermodal and higher revenue from inland activities. Gross profit was USD 266m (USD 262m), or a gross profit margin of 17.1% (17.1%), positively impacted by growth in supply chain management, warehousing and distribution, partly offset by the timing of higher maintenance costs of USD 20m in Star Air. EBITDA was negative USD 1m (positive USD 33m), mainly due to restructuring costs of USD 20m in Damco, with an EBIT conversion ratio of negative 5.9% (positive 9.2%). Adjusted for the restructuring costs, the EBITDA margin would have been 1.2% and the EBIT conversion 1.5%, which is still highly unsatisfactory.
Supply chain management revenue totalled USD 211m (USD 212m), while gross profit increased to USD 88m (USD 81m), supported by volume growth of 7.3% to 18,434 kcbm (17,178 kcbm), positively impacted by new customer wins as well as an increase in margins to 4.8 USD/cbm (4.7 USD/cbm).
Inland activities revenue increased to USD 150m (USD 139m), mainly driven by higher volumes in Latin America and Europe. Gross profit remained unchanged at USD 65m (USD 65m).

Ocean freight forwarding revenue improved to USD 185m (USD 163m), and volumes increased 2.1% to 166k TEU (163k TEU). The increase in gross profit to USD 30m (USD 29m) was due to the improved volumes and margins, supported by prioritisation of higher margin business and the higher market prices due to preloading on China-US goods ahead of expected tariffs. Margins improved by 3.3% to 181 USD/TEU (175 USD/TEU).
Airfreight forwarding revenue decreased to USD 168m (USD 225m), with reduced volumes of 25% to 45k tonnes (60k tonnes), primarily from customer deselection but also from an overall slow-down of the airfreight market and exposure to China in the retail and lifestyle segments. Despite the decrease in revenue, gross profit remained flat at USD 18m (USD 17m), driven by margin increases to 396 USD/ tonne (285 USD/tonne), due to the continuous focus on higher margin business.
Intermodal revenue increased by 4.9% to USD 644m (USD 614m) from higher volume and growth on high revenue corridors in Africa and India. The volumes increased by 3.8% to 935K FFE (900K FFE), mainly in the West Central Asia, Africa and Europe regions, partly offset by dec reases in China. Gross profit increased to USD 13m (USD 5m), mainly due to focused growth in profitable markets in Africa and India.
EBIT conversion of negative 5.9% (positive 9.2%) was mainly impacted by restructuring costs of USD 20m related to the merger of the commercial organisations in Logistics & Services and Ocean.

Terminals & Towage
Revenue increased by USD 134m to USD 1.1bn (USD 948m) and EBITDA to USD 214m (USD 191m).
Gateway terminals revenue increased by 17% to USD 921m (USD 784m), and EBITDA increased by 21% to USD 171m (USD 142m). Volume in moves grew by 15%, and gross capital expenditure (CAPEX) was reduced to USD 236m (USD 266m). Terminals under construction progressed according to plan, and Moin, Costa Rica, had its first vessel call in Q4 2018, while the divestment of the shareholding in Izmir, Turkey, announced during Q3 was completed.
Volume growth of 15% (like-for-like growth of 15%) was driven by closer collaboration with Ocean, with volumes growing 19% (like-forlike growth of 18%), while external customers grew volumes by 13% (like-for-like growth of 14%). On an equity-weighted basis, volumes grew by 13%. Revenue per move increased by 4.5% to USD 263 (USD 252). The increase was driven by increased volumes from North and Latin America with higher average rates, as well as increased storage revenues offsetting the negative rate of exchange impacts, mainly in Latin America.
Cost per move increased by 5.8% for Q4 to USD 225 (USD 213), mainly driven by higher volumes in higher cost terminals as well as by one-offs in North and Latin America, despite the increase in utilisation and favourable rate of exchange effects.

Additional information Highlights Q4 2018

Towage revenue stable at USD 166m (USD 166m), mainly impacted by volume increases in harbour towage in the Americas and Australia and improved revenue per tug job in the Americas. However, this was offset by a negative currency impact from the Asia, Middle East and Africa regions, and price pressure and volume decrease in Europe. Revenue growth adjusted for currency development was 3.4%. Harbour towage activities measured in tug jobs increased by 5.7% compared to Q4 2017.
Overall, revenue per tug job for harbour towage was at a slightly lower level measured in USD, mainly impacted by negative currency development from activities in AUD, GBP and EUR. In Europe, intense competition from consolidation amongst towage providers and an oversupply of tugs led to lower prices in local currencies, and in Australia, the entry of a new competitor has increased the price pressure in the region.
In terminal towage, annualised EBITDA per tug dropped compared to Q4 2017, which was primarily driven by a negative currency impact. Apart from this, new contracts have started in Australia, Bangladesh and Costa Rica in 2018, and the idle fleet has been reduced, partly offsetting the decrease in EBITDA per tug.

Manufacturing & Others
Revenue increased by USD 190m to USD 650m (USD 460m) with an EBITDA of USD 22m (USD 66m).
Maersk Container Industry reported revenue of USD 215m (USD 247m), with a decrease of 35% in dry containers due to a combination of lower volumes and lower sales prices as well as a cessation in the production of dry containers for the last three weeks of December. Revenue in reefer containers and services decreased by 0.7% due to a two-week production stop in October.
EBITDA of USD 9m (USD 12m) was negatively impacted by the profitability on dry containers that continued to be under severe pressure. The EBITDA margin ended at 4.2% (4.7%), with margins on dry containers decreasing significantly, whereas reefer containers and services showed a slight increase.
For other businesses, revenue ended at USD 436m (USD 214m), impacted by a higher level of oil/bunker trading with third parties as well as the inclusion of bulk activities acquired as part of the Hamburg Süd transaction. EBITDA was USD 13m (USD 54m).

EBITDA was USD 43m (USD 49m), mainly impacted by negative currency impact and higher maintenance and repair costs compared to Q3 2017, while revenue remained stable.

149 A.P. Moller - Maersk|Annual Report 2018

Discontinued operations
Maersk Drilling reported a revenue of USD 336m (USD 370m), while EBITDA was USD 139m (USD 147m), negatively impacted by lower day rates due to expiring legacy contracts, partly offset by the cessation of depreciation following classification as discontinued operations.
Maersk Drilling reported solid cash conversion from an operational cash flow of USD 138m (USD 234m), and limited maintenance CAPEX.
The strong operational performance across the fleet resulted in an average operational uptime of 98% (98%) for the jack-up rigs and 96% (98%) for the deepwater rigs.
Maersk Supply Service reported a decrease in revenue to USD 57m (USD 60m), reflecting lower rates resulting in an EBITDA of negative USD 4m (positive USD 6m), which was also negatively impacted by increased project costs.
Cash flow used for capital expenditure decreased to USD 82m (USD 206m), due to the payment of one (two) newbuildings during Q4.

To further add value and with a focus on the professional segment and others with more specific interests, detailed presentations are available each quarter following the release of the Interim Reports and the Annual Report.

Maersk also hosts, on a regular basis, Capital Markets Days, which can be followed through a live webcast, and the speakers' presentation slides can be accessed via links.
