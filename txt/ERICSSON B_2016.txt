THE BUSINESS ­ CEO dialogue
shifting focus from growth to profitability

Ericsson's CEO Börje Ekholm and Jan Frykhammar, who served as CEO July 2016 ­ mid January 2017, discuss a number of issues c oncerning 2016 and important topics for the Company going forward.

What's your reflection on the year 2016?
Jan | The negative trend with low mobile broad band investments accelerated through 2016, especially in markets with a weak macro-economic environment. As a result, the leadership team and I have been fully committed to the work to reduce cost and improve efficiency, in order to secure resilience and competitiveness for the company. The cost and efficiency program, which was intensified in the second half of 2016, is expected to reduce the annual run rate of operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, to SEK 53 billion in the second half of 2017. This is to be compared with SEK 63 billion for full-year 2014.
Börje | Operators continued to be cautious with investments in equipment as their revenues overall have come under pressure. This was reflected in our results in 2016 which did not reach our expectations. The short-term reality is that growth is limited and we have to adjust to that and prioritize what to focus on. The first task is to establish profitability and adjust the size of our operations to the demand level.
What do you consider to be the most important event during 2016?
Jan | This has been a very special year for me. I took on the role as a CEO mid-year with the ambition to stay until the search for a new CEO was completed.
During 2016 our ambition was to unite the company around the shift in focus from growth to profitability. The successful execution of the intensified activities during the second half of the year is a clear sign that the mindset of the organization has changed, enabling us to continue our work to improve profitability.

Börje | After 10 years as member of the board I got the question if I wanted to assume the dayto-day leadership of Ericsson. One of the major reasons to why I accepted was that I believe that Ericsson is a great company and that there is great business potential to exploit. This company has connected billions of people and soon we will connect many machines. Another reason to accepting the job is that I do not have anything against challenges ­ on the contrary. They trigger me. Thus, I look forward to refining the strategy to focus investments into areas where Ericsson both can and must win. Even if I have a decade of experience working for Ericsson as a board member, I am assuming this new responsibility with humility, understanding there is much left for me to learn.
How will Ericsson restore profitability?
Jan | As reported in 2016, the cost and efficiency program is progressing towards the target. During the year, we have pushed for strong accountability and focus on performance throughout the company. The program has been expanded to adjust the organization to lower sales volumes, and the priority has been to execute on the cost-out activities and to reduce working capital.
During 2016, operating expenses were significantly reduced through headcount reductions around the world. As the sales decline impacted the gross margin negatively, we also intensified the focus on reducing cost of sales, and thereby improving the gross margin.

Börje | Only consistent profitability and strong cash flow will provide us the freedom to continue investing in our research & development and into our future growth. In the near term, this means we prioritize profitability over growth. We aim at establishing competitive cost structures across all parts of our operations and our portfolio and continue to execute on our ongoing cost and efficiency program. We are also reviewing our overall priorities to focus on the most attractive areas. This effort involves key teams in the company, to secure quality of decisions and speed in implementation once decisions are made. All these activities are done to ensure that we remain at the forefront of technological devel opment ­ building on the combined strength across products, services and solutions.
How will Ericsson work to further improve customer relations?
Jan | After I assumed the CEO position at the end of June the leadership team and I spent

three months visiting a majority of Ericsson's largest customers. In fact, the whole organization has been very active in 2016 in addressing the demands of our customers with the aim to support them in expanding their businesses, monetize on their business ideas and help them keep pace with the latest industry developments. The new organization, effective from July 1, has been developed to mirror our customers' way of working and to better meet the needs of different customer segments.
Börje | Our task is to make our customers successful, which in turn will make us successful. It may sound like a management cliché, but we need to make decisions foremost with the customer in mind, thereafter Ericsson and finally the individual business unit. We want to be a partner to our customers as it is through partnership we can add true value. It should be easy to do business with us, and we need to reduce the complexity and simplify our processes in order to be more agile in our responses to customers.

Jan

Jan Frykhammar President and CEO July 25, 2016 ­ Jan 15, 2017

What are Ericsson's competitive strengths?
Jan | Our strength is in the combination of our technology and services leadership, combined with our global presence and scale. There is actually a natural competitive advantage in our unique combination of products and services, as the network depends on the services we deliver, and the other way around. Our 111,464 employees are seriously committed and have done a great job during 2016 despite the challenging environment.
Börje | Ericsson has shaped an entire industry and led global technology developments in mobility. We are only at the beginning of the mobility journey and as the networks and applications become even more important in a 5G connected world, our customers and the industry look for continuous innovation. Ericsson is built on amazing innovations and great people and our technology leadership is reflected in the 42,000 patents we have in our IPR portfolio. It is easy to quantify our technological strength. However, our competitive advantage arises when we can combine our products, with services and solutions.

Börje, could you comment on the strategic direction going forward?
Börje | As CEO of Ericsson one of my main tasks is to create a long-term strategic plan and execute on that. Emphasis will be on refining the strategy to focus investments into areas where we both can and must win. We need to ensure that Ericsson remains at the forefront of technological development ­ across our portfolio and markets.
Meeting changing customer requirements and capturing market opportunities is key to being successful and to achieve this we need to continue to build from our core strengths, in both products and services. The job is to ensure that Ericsson emerges as an even stronger leader, providing the industry and our customers with superior products, services and solutions.
In the near term, stability will be key to establishing a strong base for future growth. This means prioritizing profitability over growth, but also to diligently continue to work on efficiency and effectiveness across all operations.

THE BUSINESS ­ This is Ericsson
This is Ericsson
Ericsson provides high performing solutions for Networks, IT & Cloud, and Media. The company provides infrastructure, services and software to the telecom industry and other sectors. Ericsson has approximately 110,000 employees with customers in more than 180 countries.

During 140 years, Ericsson has delivered customer value by continuously evolving its business portfolio through its core assets ­ tech nology and services, global scale and skills. This, in combination with its business expertise, has resulted in a profound technology and s ervices leadership. Ericsson believes that the Company's technological and financial capa bility to adapt and the will to change are major competitive strengths.
Ericsson's ability to transform its core business and its ambition to enter into new and a djacent markets are key to generating customer and shareholder value.
In 2016, approximately 67% of Ericsson's business was related to services and software sales, compared with less than 50% ten years ago.

This change reflects the ongoing transformation from a hardware-centric business to one where the share of the software and services business continues to increase. However, competitive hardware also remains an important performance differentiator. The number of product platforms has been significantly reduced over time, while the scope has extended from mainly mobile infrastructure and related services to include IT, Cloud, support systems, media and new industry verticals. The workforce is also going through a transformation, reflecting the Company's business and competence shift. In 2016, approximately 15,000 employees joined Ericsson and about 20,000 employees left the Company, resulting in a net reduction of 4,800 employees.

In order to restore profitability, Ericsson is focusing on three areas: efficiency improvements, monetize Networks and build success in IT & Cloud, Media and Industry and Society. The cost and efficiency program is progressing towards the target and has been expanded to adjust the organization to lower sales volumes.

Efficiency improvements In November 2014, Ericsson launched a global cost and efficiency program with the aim to generate savings of SEK 9 billion during 2017, with half of the savings in operating expenses and the other half within cost of sales. On July 19, 2016, the Company announced additional activities, targeting a new lower annual run rate of operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, of SEK 53 billion in the second half of 2017. This can be compared with SEK 63 billion for full-year 2014 and equates to double the previously targeted savings in operating expenses. All efficiency measures are progressing according to plan. Operating expenses were SEK 60.5 (64.1) billion in 2016 and operating expenses excluding restructuring charges amounted to SEK 56.4 (61.4) billion. Total restructuring charges in 2016 were SEK 7.6 (5.0) billion.
During 2016, the negative industry trends intensified and thus impacted demand for mobile broadband, especially in markets with a weak macro-economic environment. Ericsson's sales in Europe also declined, as a result of lower capacity sales and the completion of large mobile broadband projects. The sales decline has impacted the gross margin negatively, and

implemented cost reductions have not been sufficient to offset the effect. To adapt operations to a lower mobile broadband market, the Company has intensified actions to reduce cost of sales further. The Company's ambition is to make cost of sales reductions visible in an improved gross margin in the second half of 2017 compared to full year 2016.
The scope of the global cost and efficiency program involves cost of sales reductions in service delivery and supply, as well as operating expense reductions in R&D and SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative expenses) including common support functions. Major elements of the cost of sales improvement plan include activities related to service delivery such as centralization, automation and standardization, and production related activities such as increased outsourcing and production site consolidation. The target is to increase production outsourcing to above 50% in 2017 from less than 40% in 2015. Major elements in the operating expense improvement plan involve headcount reductions and outsourcing. The shift in workforce and competence is also an important long-term, value-driving priority.

Monetize Networks Ericsson's strong position in both mobile infrastructure and telecom services has resulted in a large installed global base to build on, which Ericsson aims to monetize to increase sales and improve profitability. In telecom services, the Company monetizes its strong global footprint in managed services, with more than 300 ongoing contracts. In mobile infrastructure, the ambition is to increase capacity and software sales into the installed base. While market conditions are challenging in certain parts of the world, the Company continues its work to capture business opportunities as more markets shift from 3G to 4G. At the same time, the Company intends to capture growth on the strong 4G footprint with the ambition to extend its technology leadership in the emerging 5G market. The ambition is to lead in 5G transformation and thereby also strengthen profitability within the Networks business. Improving the Network R ollout business from negative to break-even or positive result is included in the monetize N etwork's area.

Build success in IT & Cloud, Media and Industry and Society Some of the attractive characteristics in the adjacent areas IT & Cloud, Media and Industry and Society are recurring revenues and a higher share of software and professional services. Over time, growth is primarily expected to be organic, complemented by selective acquisitions and a broad range of partnerships and collaborations. The overall ambitions of the p artnerships, collaborations and selective M&A activities are to expand market footprint, strengthen competitive assets, fill portfolio gaps, and, above all, strengthen Ericsson's ability to create value and to accelerate profitable growth. The strategic partnership with Cisco is an example of an important collaboration initiative.
The plan also includes expansion and capturing growth through the customer group Industry and Society in the industry verticals of utilities, transport and public safety by reusing Ericsson's core offerings.

Over the next few years, telecom networks will transform into open, horizontal and programm able platforms that can connect all clouds to all devices. The increasing amount of industry use cases, including autonomous cars, massive and critical machine-to-machine communi cations and the vast usage of sensors will require more spectrum ­ as well as new spectrum. This will add a new set of requirements to existing telecom networks, creating new business opportunities for Ericsson.

A market in transformation The market is transforming, creating new needs for Ericsson's customers. By applying network slicing and virtualization, the network can be segmented in a smart and efficient way. This enables operators to expand their business and address new enterprise segments and industry verticals. Ericsson has taken a broad approach with the ambition to lead and drive the digitalization and transformation of the telecom industry as well as of other industries including utility, transport, and public safety.
Global market trends For 2016, Ericsson estimates its total addressable market to be USD ~210 billion, growing to USD 215­225 billion in 2018, corresponding to a CAGR of 1­3%. The overall macro environment in 2016 has been challenging, especially in emerging markets, with a negative impact on investment willingness in certain regions and markets. In developed markets, investments in

Europe have been slow, while investments in the US have remained stable. Investments in China have continued on a high level driven by 4G deployments. Only about 40 percent of the world's population was covered by 4G/LTE at the end of 2015, which means that there is a great need for additional mobile broadband coverage before the next technology, 5G, becomes available. The demand and interest in digital transformation enabled by 5G, IoT (Internet of Things) and Cloud has accelerated, while at the same time, the industry convergence continues across IT, telecom and media.
In 2022, Ericsson estimates that there will be around 10 billion mobile subscriptions (including cellular M2M) and over 6.8 billion connected smartphones. While the earlier generations of mobile technology offered connectivity to mobile phones and smartphones, the transition to the next generation, 5G, will involve devices beyond smartphones. Ericsson estimates that there will be 29 billion connected devices in 2022, of

which 18 billion will be related to Internet of Things. Video is expected to represent 75% of all mobile traffic in 2022.
New services and IoT communications have a wide variety of requirements on connectivity performance, coverage, security and reliability. Earlier generations of mobile technologies such as GSM and LTE operate on licensed spectrum. In 5G, licensed and unlicensed spectrum will be needed and both traditional (e.g. Wi-Fi, LTE) and new radio access technologies will be used. In the existing spectrum, 5G technology is an evolution of LTE networks and therefore backwards compatible with earlier generations of mobile communications, while the new spectrum will be addressed by new technologies. The technologies will interwork and offer strengthened capabilities to support a broad range of services.
Enriched mobile communications via smartphones have different requirements than machine type of communications.

IoT communications also have different requirements depending on if it is critical or massive. Critical IoT might require high quality of service (QoS) or telecom grade connectivity, while the requirements of massive IoT applications such as smart sensors that connect to the cloud once in a while, are related to low cost, low energy consumption and low bandwidth.
In an environment with high data volumes, low latencies and a large number of devices, the architecture needs to be horizontalized. The benefits of a horizontal platform include the possibility to slice the network to allocate resources in the most optimal way and to connect a device to applications relevant to that device in the cloud.
Building network infrastructure in a cloud environment also requires a decoupling of network functions (software) from hardware, which is achieved through technology virtualization.

5G
Ericsson is at the forefront of the 5G market, having signed 28 MoUs (Memo randum of Understanding) with operators, and with 20 different industry partners and some 45 universities and research institutes involved in the d evelopment of 5G. In addition, Ericsson is taking a leading and active role in 5G standardization globally. The Company expects 5G in large commercial deployments by 2020.

The 5G network will spur both business and technical innovation across many industries. Ericsson has several testbeds and is performing field trials of 5G radio technology, with larger pre-commercial operator trials planned for 2017.
5G forms a network where fixed and mobile services converge and will therefore also require a transformation of both the core network and the transport network. The network will consist of different access and connectivity solutions, driven by software, addressing the demands on mobile communications beyond 2020. The network will be sustainable, flexible and operationally scalable, addressing multiple industries and use cases. In fact, it will change the way the telecom industry has worked so far.
During the lifetime of traditional mobile communications, the development and adoption of new technology generations has been done through standardization processes and bodies. 5G is different as it will include devices beyond smartphones and therefore have more extensive adaption. Hence, the broad variety of use cases requires cross industry collaboration and a combination of conventional standardization and the use of Open source solutions. Thus, 5G will form a new global ecosystem with multiple use cases where Ericsson's offering includes telecom

transformation as well as digital transformation of other industries.
The increased traffic capacity and the very high data rates of 5G technology will require the development of a new flexible air interface, NX, and the introduction of new spectrum within the existing spectrum below 6 GHz, as well as new spectrum in higher frequency bands up to 100 GHz. As capacity needs have continued to grow, the use of spectrum has shifted towards higher frequencies where larger channel bandwidths are more easily found. Compared to 4G-licensed spectrum, the efficiency of 5G-licensed spectrum is significantly enhanced. Backhaul capacity also needs to evolve further to support future extreme capacity needs.
With data rates up to 100 times faster, network latency lowered by a factor of five, mobile data volumes 1,000 times greater than today's, and battery life of remote cellular devices stretched to 10 years or more, 5G will enable new capabilities, of which greater efficiency, agile networks and seamless connectivity are a few examples. The 5G network will also, supported by its inherent sustainability characteristics, consume much less energy than earlier generations and be more cost efficient through automation and hardware optimization.

The Customers
Ericsson's main customers are telecom operators around the world, representing approxi mately 90% of revenues in 2016. In addition, the Company has customers in the selected industries of utility, transport and public safety. The IPR licensing business customer base is mainly handset suppliers.

Operators For operators to be competitive, the telecom networks need to remain a relevant part of providing high quality user experience, and they need to deliver added value in new and unique ways. Operators focus on differentiating their offerings, investing in agile and efficient networks, managing the user experience and complexity and securing good coverage and performance for all services. During 2016, there has also been an increased operator focus on 5G and IoT, digital transformation and core network transformation.
As mobile data traffic and the number of devices continue to increase, operators need to invest in infrastructure that supports throughput, performance and the large volumes of devices. While quality of service is the foundation of success, some operators differentiate by investing in high performing networks, some by swiftly adapting to market conditions and others by being first in the market with uniquely designed service offerings.

Utility, transport and public safety The industries of utility, transport and public safety use ICT technologies in the ongoing market transformation, which is driven by mobility and new evolving technologies including smart grids, intelligent transport systems and services. Customers in these industries use ICT as an enabler to enhance the customer experience through innovation as they develop new business models and form new ecosystems.
Handset suppliers Ericsson's revenues from IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) has a customer base mainly consisting of handset suppliers. Smartphones are based on mobile technology, and Ericsson's essential patents cover 2G, 3G, and 4G tech nologies. Over the next few years the IPR and licensing customer base is expected by Ericsson to expand to suppliers of IoT-connected devices.

Introduction In Networks, Ericsson supports its operator c ustomers by leveraging the advantages of technology and services leadership. The portfolio of radio networks and backhaul solutions are based on industry standards and can also be industrialized and adjusted to meet the demands of other industry verticals. In addition, Ericsson's services capabilities address operator demand in an increasingly complex network environment.
The new organizational structure enables a close set-up between products and services, and allows technology and services expertise to stay close to customers, which also supports simplicity and speed in the delivery process.
Market trends and addressable market The addressable market for Networks is estimated by Ericsson to be USD 100 billion in 2016, including both products and services. The total addressable market for Networks, which is a combination of the mobile infrastructure market and the related telecom services market, is estimated by Ericsson to decline by 0­2% CAGR 2016­ 2018.
The competitive portfolio of radio networks and backhaul solutions are based on the technology platforms that the Company develops for

telecom operators. Telecom operator revenues in developed markets have been flat during recent years, and investments in many emerging markets have been impacted by a weak macro- economic environment. These circumstances have impacted the overall RAN (Radio Access Network) equipment market, which is estimated by Ericsson to have declined by 10­15% in 2016. This trend is expected to prevail and the Company is estimating that the RAN equipment m arket will decline by 2­6% in 2017.
Offering ­ main components Networks includes several generations of radio networks as well as small cells and microwave products.

THE MARKET

Business model Mobile broadband Ericsson's most traditional business model is mobile broadband, where the Company delivers and rolls out telecom networks including all necessary hardware and software. Key aspects for an operator to roll out a new technology ­ such as 4G/LTE ­ include satisfying end user demand in an efficient way, while maintaining a high-quality user experience and maximizing the revenue potential. When building network coverage across one or more geographic areas, the coverage phase, there is a large share of hardware, and the project often includes network rollout services. For Ericsson, the initial build-out or rollout phase is capital-intensive and has a lower- than-average gross margin. Currently LTE coverage is growing quickly in urban, suburban and rural areas in many countries, and Ericsson estimates that world population coverage by LTE technology will be above 80% in 2022.
When the network is up and running and demands for capacity expansions and quality improvements arise, profitability increases, driven by an increased share of software sales, network densification and less complex hardware installations, network optimization and customer support. This phase is called the cap acity phase. The coverage phases are normally 1­2 years while the capacity phase lasts until the equipment is phased out, normally after 7­10 years in operation. One of the key drivers for increased capacity in the mobile networks is increased mobile data usage. Ericsson estimates that traffic generated by smartphones alone will increase tenfold between 2016 and 2022.

Managed Services In Managed Services, Ericsson takes over aspects of a customer's business operation as a commitment over several years. The Managed Services business model includes three phases. The initial phase, the transition, is coupled with lower profitability, as it involves up-front costs when staff and expertise are transferred from the customer to Ericsson. In the second phase, the transformation phase, Ericsson introduces its global processes, methods and tools and implements a global delivery model. In the third phase, Ericsson focuses on optimization and industrialization by simplifying, implementing and consolidating resources, processes, methods and tools to allow for improved profitability. Managed services contracts are normally 5­7 years long. The first two phases last for 1­1.5 years while the optimization phase represents the remainder of the contract period.
The Company believes that it has reached a good balance of contracts in the transition, transformation and optimization phases.
Priorities Ericsson is a leading and trusted network partner. Networks' mid-term priorities are to leverage the installed base, improve profitability and increase the competiveness of its portfolio with the best total cost of ownership for its customers, as well as secure leadership in the evolution to 5G. To leverage the installed base Ericsson plans to grow its managed services and customer support business by addressing end user experience and network evolution, grow capacity sales and leverage new spectrum.

Introduction The technology evolution driven by mobility, broadband, analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud is triggering a new wave of digital transformation. It is not only a technology shift but also a strong enabler for business transformation across many industries. For operators, three main business drivers for transformation can be defined: >> Digital operations ­ using cloud, virtualization
and automation to build a more agile and e fficient network and operations >> Digital engagement ­ as operators move from just selling connectivity to providing a full customer and application centric business, they need new tools and ways to constantly be able to engage with customers and partners >> Digital services ­ the ability to innovate and introduce services in days, not months, using insights derived from data analytics to identify and capture new business

Digital transformation for operators is not only a way to stay competitive, it is also a necessary shift to prepare for the growing IoT business.
IT & Cloud address these emerging demands, and with its extensive product port folio and comprehensive service offering, IT & Cloud is equipped to handle transformations.
The desired position for Ericsson is to become a leading digital business transformation partner in and across the support systems, Telecom core and IT Cloud domains.
Market trends and addressable market IT & Cloud's focus is on creating opportunities for operators to unlock the full potential of mobility, mobile broadband, analytics, IoT and cloud.
Digital transformation for operators is closely related to the support systems domain and is driven by the fact that today's customers, both consumers and enterprises, exhibit different expectations and behavior compared to what

THE BUSINESS ­ Business structure

many incumbent businesses are used to. This has resulted in many operators realizing that they need to embrace digital transformation to change the way they interact with their customers and to be able to provide a convenient and context-aware experience across all customer touch points. In addition, operators increasingly work with partners to participate in or drive ecosystems that accelerate innovation and increase value for consumers and industries. Lastly, to reach agility, automation and resource efficiency from software-defined infrastructure, virtualization of network functions and software-defined networking, operators are looking to transform their back-office operations and IT environments to take advantage of advanced analytics and machine learning technology.
The market for Telecom core transformation is driven by operators wanting the ability to address new enterprise segments cost efficiently, with new offerings, business models and use cases based on 5G or IoT, or both. This need is satisfied by using new Telecom core technologies like software-defined infrastructure and networking, virtualization, open systems and analytics, which allow the operator to slice its network to serve a particular industry or business segment, for example. Slicing provides dedicated yet dynamic resource utilization and quality assurance for each business, independent of others, at a much lower total cost for operators.
IT operations are under pressure to deliver speed, scalability and flexibility that meet business demands, while at the same time reducing CAPEX and OPEX. The virtualization of network functions and the related horizontal network architecture creates a market for cloud trans formation and convergence of IT and networks. In addition, new cloud technology allows any enterprise to build cloud infrastructures to

support their digital transformation, including architecture and economics equivalent to that of the traditional cloud service providers. The market also shows an increasing interest in making more use of public clouds for enterprise applications and in creating a hybrid cloud that shares resources from private and public clouds to run their workloads.
The addressable market (products and services) for IT & Cloud (telecom operators only) in 2016 is estimated by Ericsson to be approximately USD 100 billion, with an estimated growth rate of 5­7% CAGR 2016­2018.
Offering ­ main components Transformation implies journeys from the current state to a future state in many dimensions of the business. Ericsson's IT & Cloud product and service portfolio provides customer solutions for all of the above mentioned transformation journeys. The Company believes that the ability to offer a combination of products, technology and expertise in networks, software, cloud and business processes is a significant competitive advantage. This ability is highly relevant to other industries as well as it enables expansion of the business beyond telecom operators even further.
IT & Cloud Services With over 17,000 consultants and systems integrators building and using common best practices, service automation and asset tools, Ericsson is in a strong position to guide customers through the challenging, complex and in many cases multi-year transformation journeys. Ericsson's services capabilities enable customer engagements ranging from consulting, setting the business direction and transformation plan, systems integration and building the new environment to establishing business processes and IT operations on behalf of the customer.

of video-enabled connected devices that are driving the transformation of the market. Ericsson estimates that the share of video traffic will increase to 75% of total mobile traffic in 2022, compared to 50% today. The industry convergence and competitive landscape require a new set of skills and there is an increased demand for outsourcing of media operations.
While the cable operator market is moving in the direction of all IP delivery, broadcasters are seeing increased competitive pressure from the telecom operators, which are moving into broadcasting by packaging and distributing content over broadband. They are expanding their business from controlling the bit pipe to also include production and control of content. This is reflected for example in AT&T's move towards content and its proposed takeover of Time Warner, and in Verizon's acquisition of AOL and Yahoo.
The over-the-top players (OTT) that create global offerings at lower price points constitute another group of competitors to broadcasters. Compared to the global over-the-top players, broadcasters have a strong advantage in their localized content. They know the culture and the local consumption habits, something that Ericsson in its offering is also trying to leverage. The aim is to be global but with a localized managed services model.
Offering ­ main components Ericsson develops and delivers software-based solutions for TV and media and combines a product portfolio that spans the TV value chain, with systems integration and managed services. The portfolio includes compression, software and hardware-based video processing and storage, content publishing via set-top box or pure OTT, content delivery and analytics.

Ericsson has more than 42,000 granted patents. The Company is a net receiver of licensing royalties and has agreements with the largest handset suppliers in the world. Ericsson c ontinues to expand its IPR licensing business into new technologies and industries.

Introduction Ericsson's technology leadership in mobile communications is demonstrated by a further strengthened IPR portfolio of more than 42,000 granted patents compared to 39,000 granted patents in 2015. Through its IPR licensing, the Company is able to encourage innovation and re-invest in further development of the communications eco-system. At the same time, IPR licensing strengthens Ericsson's position as one of the technology leaders in the ICT industry and ensures a fair return on the Company's R&D investment through fair, reasonable and non- discriminatory (FRAND) licensing.

IPR licensing revenues were SEK 10.0 (14.4) b illion in 2016 with margins above the Company average. The Company is currently expanding its licensing business beyond handset suppliers to include other industries such as media and IoT device manufacturers. Internet of Things represents an opportunity for connected device manufacturers to expand their product offerings to new areas, and for Ericsson to expand its IPR business and become a preferred technology partner in new industries.

Market trends and addressable market Ericsson's licensing business promotes open standards, which enable decreased costs of technology for consumers through economies of scale and fair pricing. The open standards also lower barriers to market entry and, through interoperability and high performance, enable large markets for digital products and services. The majority of today's IPR licensing revenues are generated from handset suppliers. The Company has agreements with the largest handset suppliers in the world. However, over the last couple of years an increasing share of the handset market is represented by the Chinese suppliers. Ericsson does not yet have agreements with some of these suppliers, which affects the IPR licensing revenue negatively in the short-term. The company is addressing new handset suppliers with the ambition to sign license agreements with them.
Ericsson is expanding the licensing business to cover products beyond handsets as connectivity is introduced in industries other than telecommunications. By 2022, the number of connected devices is expected by Ericsson to grow to 29 billion from today's 16 billion devices.
These other industries need efficient ways to allow for all connected devices to be adequately licensed. As standard-essential patents are licensed, licensing terms are adapted for each use case to reflect the value of the patented standardized technology for the device in question and its user. The value of wireless connectivity differs greatly depending on the use case, and FRAND licensing practices are flexible enough to handle this.
The Avanci platform In 2016, Ericsson led the formation of Avanci, a one stop shop for licensing of standard essential patents for certain IoT applications. Avanci is a third party entity through which holders of standard essential patents can license their wireless technologies to companies and manufacturers who develop and create connected devices for

the IoT. For device manufacturers, the open m arketplace simplifies access to wireless technologies. Avanci connects the patent holders with the companies developing the IoT devices in an uncomplicated manner and simplifies the process of identifying what essential patents are required in each device. Avanci's initial focus will be on licenses for connected vehicles and smart meters.
Offering ­ main components Ericsson's IPR portfolio includes both patents and technology know-how. Patent licensing includes giving access to patents for different technology standards, while in technology licensing Ericsson provides specifications for proprietary technologies such as different i nterfaces.
Business model For Ericsson, there is great value in the IPR portfolio in terms of securing cross-licensing agreements. These agreements are signed with other IPR patent holders in order to avoid litigation or disputes, and they give both signing companies the freedom to market products and solutions that utilize each other's technology. As Ericsson has a strong patent portfolio, the Company believes that this approach also enables the Company to commercialize and obtain a fair return on the IPR portfolio when others use the Company's technology.
Over the past five years, annual R&D investments have been SEK 32­36 billion, and in 2016 revenues from the IPR licensing business were SEK 10.0 (14.4) billion. As IPR licensing margins are above the Company average, they have an accretive impact on profitability.
Priorities Ericsson's ambition is to capture growth in the IPR licensing business by leveraging its tech nology leadership, ensuring license agreements with handset suppliers and expanding its business to industries other than telecommunications.

In 2016, due to organizational changes that took place from July 1 and a new organizational structure that was not yet complete, Ericsson conducted a poll of a representative sample of 25% of the global employee population instead of the Group wide survey normally conducted annually. Complex industry and organizational changes were reflected in overall engagement levels; the engagement index was 68% in 2016 compared to 76% in 2015. However, for Ericsson as an organization, the employees continue to

report a very high sense of pride, with 82% stating that they are "proud to work for Ericsson", compared to 88% in 2015.
Developing the right leadership capabilities and skills is essential for Ericsson's Networked society strategy. Strong leadership is critical to taking the business forward as the Company continues to evolve.
Diversity at an inclusive workplace Ericsson is a global company with over 170 nationalities within the organization and customers in more than 180 countries. With diversity and inclusion as one of the prime drivers of culture, Ericsson aspires to be as diverse as the world in which the Company operates. Diversity is supported by an inclusive workplace where people are valued for the different perspectives, ideas and experiences that they bring to the Company.
Attracting more women to the technology sector remains a challenge. One of Ericsson's goals for 2020 is for 30 percent of all executives, line managers and the overall workforce at the Company to be women. To achieve this goal, the gender perspective is included in strategic processes, including talent acquisition and development programs. Ericsson also works with universities and through employer branding to attract more women. Additionally, the Global Leadership Team members all have diversity and inclusion objectives related to gender in their performance management goals.

THE BUSINESS ­ Sustainability
Sustainability and corporate responsibility
As a responsible and relevant driver of positive change in society, Ericsson is committed to creating business value while reducing risk.

Key focus areas Ericsson's Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility (CR) focus areas are conducting business responsibly, the environment, energy and climate action, and internet for all. Since launch in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice and halt climate change provide a framework for describing and measuring Ericsson's impacts on society.
Conducting business responsibly Responsible business practices are embedded in Ericsson's operations to manage risks. The Ericsson Group Management System includes Group policies, processes and directives encompassing responsible sourcing, occupational health and safety, environmental management, anti-corruption and human rights. External assurance providers audit the system and the Ericsson Sustainability and CR report.
Governance The Code of Business Ethics (CoBE) sets the tone for how Ericsson conducts business globally. All employees periodically acknowledge the CoBE with the next such acknowledgement planned for 2017. The Code of Conduct applies to employees and suppliers and is based on the UN Global Compact (UNGC) ten principles on human rights, labor conditions, environmental management and anti-corruption. Ericsson is comm itted to implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) across its business operations and addresses and reports on its most salient human rights issues (the right to privacy, freedom of expression and labor standards) according to the UNGP Reporting Framework annually in its Sustaina bility and CR report.

ened through introducing an automated anti- corruption screening tool for supplier and thirdparty due diligence. The tool was piloted in one region during 2016 and is planned to be further rolled out in 2017. By the end of 2016, over 95,900 employees have completed the anti- corruption e-learning launched in 2013.
Ericsson is currently voluntarily cooperating with inquiries from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice regarding its compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These inquiries concern a period from January 1, 2007 and onwards, and the Company will make additional disclosures regarding these inquiries to the extent required.
It is important to underline that Ericsson has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption and the Company continuously strengthen its compliance p rocesses and how they are implemented. Over the last year Ericsson intensified its efforts, adding both internal resources as well as engaging outside counsel to support the overall process and give an outside view of the robustness of its programs.
Human rights To fulfil its responsibility to respect human rights in accordance with the UNGP, Ericsson has developed and strengthened its human rights framework. The Ericsson Sales Compliance Process includes a forum that regularly reviews potential human rights impacts, with mitigation actions determined by the Sales Compliance Board where necessary.
Since 2013, Ericsson has performed UNGPaligned Human Rights Impact Assessments in Myanmar, Iran and Ethiopia. In 2016, work was also initiated to evaluate Cuba from a human rights perspective.

Anti-corruption Ericsson has a zero-tolerance approach to c orruption and has invested continuously and systematically over the past decade in order to strengthen anti-corruption processes. The Company's anti-corruption program, headed by a Chief Compliance Officer, focuses on prevention and accountability. In 2016 it was strength-

the Company's behalf, Ericsson takes a comprehensive and inclusive approach. The Company reports in the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report on both its own incidents and fatalities and those of suppliers building and servicing networks on behalf of Ericsson.
Environment, energy and climate change Ericsson is committed to develop and deliver solutions to support climate action. At the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in Morocco in 2016, Ericsson and other leading companies joined world leaders in supporting the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. In 2016, Ericsson's Connected Mangroves project was one of the five winners of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change "Momentum for Change" award at COP22, which honored ICT initiatives contri buting to climate resilience.
Energy performance and water management Ericsson products are designed with the aim of minimizing the components, packaging and climate impacts. In 2016, continued improvements were made in energy performance across the entire product portfolio, including Ericsson Radio System (ERS), which provides a 50% improvement in energy efficiency on previous generation. ICT also has significant transformative potential to help other sectors such as Energy and Transport to reduce their environmen tal impact. As a signatory to the UN Global Compact's CEO Water Mandate, Ericsson signals its commitment to adopting and implementing a comprehensive approach to water management.
Global Product Take-Back The Ericsson Global Product Take-back Program oversees responsible treatment of products at the end of their lifecycle. The program is offered to customers globally free of charge, not only in markets where this is required by law. In 2016, 9,600 tons of used products were taken back for controlled materials recycling. During take-back, over 98% of the materials are recycled.

Smart, sustainable cities Deployment of broadband infrastructure is an enabler of many future services such as smart grids and intelligent transport. The Stockholm Royal Seaport project, in which Ericsson has participated for more than five years, offers a blueprint for how Swedish innovation can be applied to the sustainable city design. In 2016, Ericsson began research into enhanced consumer awareness and control of energy consumption through use of connected appliances.
Internet for all In 2016, Ericsson launched a suite of business solutions to increase viability of mobile internet investments in developing markets. Network innovations help operators create viable and inclusive business in rural or off-grid settings by improving mobile network performance and efficiency and reducing associated network costs, and by enabling affordable 2G to 3G upgrades. These solutions build on Ericsson Radio System to cut total cost of ownership by up to 40% for operators involved in expanding mobile broadband. The Company's Pure Solar solution launched in Myanmar for off-grid service with no diesel backup.
Technology for GoodTM In the Networked Society, Ericsson is a leading advocate for Technology for GoodTM using core competence and technology to address sustainable development challenges. Examples include: >> Education ­ Ericsson is the lead technology
partner in Connect to Learn, a global education initiative, now in 23 countries, engaging 16 mobile operators and benefitting about 80,000 students. >> Refugees ­ Under a global partnership with the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Connect to Learn is working in Domiz refugee camps in Northern Iraq with operator AsiaCell to provide educ ational support to Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and refugees in their host communities. >> Humanitarian Response ­ Ericsson Res ponse, deployed under the ICT Humanitarian Response Working Group for Haiti, established 16 sites to support humanitarian users. There were six Ericsson Response volunteers deployed in 2016 to Haiti, with two additional volunteers supporting the deployment through the end of January 2017.

Solar breakthrough in Myanmar

Operators in developing regions are challenged in finding a viable way to extend network coverage to rural areas that are off the electricity grid.
In Myanmar, 70% of the population lacks access to commercial electricity. Rural off-grid sites typically use a diesel generator and battery solution, leading to significant costs and CO2 emissions. Faced with this challenge, together with mobile operator Telenor, Ericsson has succeeded in deploying the world's first 500 Watt solar powered site in Myanmar, making solar more economical than diesel for the first time.
A number of innovations, including Ericsson's unique Psi coverage solution were deployed at the site. The result is a 75% reduction in total site power consumption while retaining full coverage, service quality and performance. With economy comes scale and with millions of base stations worldwide, there is opportunity to decrease the dependency on diesel fuel for off-grid sites, making a significant contribution against global warming and extend cost effective mobile broadband to the 50% of the world population that are currently without Internet access.

Networks The segment delivered hardware and software that are needed for mobile and fixed communications, several generations of radio networks, IP and transmission networks, core networks and cloud. The major business models were based on network coverage build followed by network capacity expansions and upgrades with a revenue mix consisting of hardware and software. Gross margins were affected by the business mix between sales of network coverage build-outs, upgrades and network expansions. A majority of the Company's Research and Development (R&D) investments were made within Networks in 2016. Major competitors included Huawei, Nokia and ZTE.
Global Services The segment delivered network rollout services and professional services such as managed services, consulting and systems integration (CSI) and customer support as well as network design and optimization services. Through Ericsson's service delivery organization and it's four Global Service Centers, Ericsson deployed, operated and evolved networks and related support systems. Ericsson provided managed services to networks that were typically multi-vendor, multi- technology environments. In broadcast services Ericsson expanded its service portfolio offering automation and standardization of processes, methods and tools.

The business mix in Global Services was divided between network rollout services and professio nal services, and approximately 2/3 of professio nal services sales were recurring. Major competitors included Accenture, Huawei, IBM and Nokia.
Support Solutions The segment developed and delivered software-based solutions for OSS and BSS as well as TV and media solutions. Sales were dominated by software, while the services part of the business was reported in Global Services. Ericsson is transforming the business model from one based on a revenue from traditional telecom software licenses to one that emphasizes recurring software licensing built on subscription-based software offerings. Due to its high software content, gross margin was typically higher than Company average, and at the same time R&D intensive. Major competitors included Amdocs, Huawei, IBM and Oracle.

change in reporting structure from 2017

Ericsson implemented a new organizational structure in 2016. The new structure builds on the Company's technology leadership, services leadership and global scale and skills, and it supports cost reductions and efficiency improvements. It also removes duplication across portfolios and capabilities. Ericsson has adapted its organization to mirror its customers' ways of working, with the aim to create a more efficient and purpose-built organization to meet

the needs of different customer segments and more quickly seize business opportunities.
From January 1, 2017, financial reporting is done according to a new structure, with three new financial reporting segments, Networks, IT & Cloud and Media. The new segments contain both products and services and the structure aligns company reporting with strategy execution in a simpler and more transparent way.

letter from the chairman

Dear shareholders,

During 2016, the market situation became increasingly challenging, mainly driven by a weak macro-economic environment. As a result, the Company increased its focus on improving profitability and on addressing the needs of customers, partly through the implementation of a series of organizational and structural changes. At the same time the Board decided that the time was right for a new leader to drive the next phase of Ericsson's transformation.
The ambition was to find a CEO with the right background, attitude and leadership ability to take on the challenging situation, and this resulted in the appointment of Börje Ekholm as the new CEO. Börje Ekholm will lead the Company into the next phase, implement and develop the strategy, while executing on the cost and efficiency program. The Board believes that he has deep insight and understanding both of the commercial consequences and the technical aspects of the digital transformation enabled by 5G, IoT and Cloud. The Board would also at this point like to take the opportunity to thank Hans Vestberg for his energetic and inspiring leadership as CEO for almost seven years. We would also like to thank Jan Frykhammar, who shifted from CFO to interim CEO, for steering Ericsson through the second half of 2016 in a very successful way.
The Board believes that good talent management and succession planning are important tools not only on the executive level but also in technology and commercial management. By attracting and developing the best talent and establishing a high-performance organization, Ericsson can maintain a leading position in the highly competitive and ever transforming market. Also, as Ericsson speeds up strategy implementation, the Company needs to remain true to its core values of professionalism, respect and perseverance, which is reflected in a culture of endeavor and innovation.
In order to deliver value and to retain the trust of its stakeholders, Ericsson needs to continuously focus on corporate governance and to conduct business responsibly to meet demanding financial, social and environmental standards. The Board invests a significant amount of time in corporate governance and in 2016 we paid special attention to the Company's anti-corruption

program which in 2016 was strengthened through the introduction of an automated anti-corruption screening tool for supplier and third-party due diligence. Currently Ericsson is voluntarily cooperating with inquiries from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice regarding its compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These inquiries concern the last ten years and we will make additional disclosures regarding these inquiries to the extent required. It is important to underline that Ericsson has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption and has over the years continuously and systematically focused on strengthening the anti-corruption processes.
For stakeholders in the capital market, including our shareholders, Ericsson's capital structure is an area of high interest which the Board invests significant time in analyzing and monitoring. Business plans and investments in R&D and other assets are carefully evaluated. The Board's proposal for the AGM is a dividend of SEK 1.00 for 2016 as we believe that it is prudent to align the dividend level with 2016 earnings and the current market outlook. However, the Board expresses confidence in the ongoing actions to improve Ericsson's financial performance, and has the ambition to increase the dividend over time as our performance improves.
Ericsson's ambition is to be a leading transformation partner for existing and new customers. We as the Board believe the Company's assets in combination with close customer relations and its will to transform, provide a solid foundation for long term profitable growth and value creation.

>> Reported sales decreased by ­10% mainly due to weaker demand for mobile broadband, especially in markets with a weak macroeconomic environment. IPR licensing revenues declined to SEK 10.0 (14.4) billion.
>> Operating income declined to SEK 6.3 (21.8) billion due to lower sales and a changed business mix in mobile broadband, with a lower proportion of capacity business. This was partly offset by lower operating expenses.
>> Cash flow from operating activities was SEK 14.0 (20.6) billion. Net cash at year-end was SEK 31.2 billion.
>> The Board of Directors proposes a dividend for 2016 of SEK 1.00 (3.70) per share to the AGM.

Restructuring charges and efficiency program Restructuring charges amounted to SEK ­7.6 (­5.0) billion. The charges were mainly related to the cost and efficiency program initially announ ced in November 2014, and expanded in 2016. The cost and efficiency program is progressing according to plan and the target is to reduce the annual run rate of operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, to SEK 53 billion in the second half of 2017. Efforts continue in order to reduce cost of sales, targeting to improve gross margin in the second half of 2017 compared with full-year 2016. With current plans, total restructuring charges for 2017 are estimated to be SEK 3 billion.
Operating expenses Total operating expenses decreased to SEK 60.5 (64.1) billion as a result of the cost and efficiency program and lower amortizations of intangible assets. Operating expenses included restructu ring charges of SEK ­4.1 (­2.8) billion.
Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and expenses were SEK 0.4 (0.2) billion. Currency hedge contract effects impacted the result with SEK ­0.9 (­1.1) billion. They derive from the hedge contract b alance in USD. The SEK has weakened against the USD between December 31, 2015 (SEK/USD rate 8.40) and December 31, 2016 (SEK/USD rate 9.06). The negative currency hedge effects were more than offset by several minor positive items.

Gross margin Gross margin declined to 29.8% (34.8%) due to a sales mix with lower share of mobile capacity business, higher share of Global Services sales and lower IPR licensing revenues as well as lower Global Services margins. In addition, restructuring charges included in the gross m argin increased to SEK ­3.5 (­2.3) billion.

Operating income Operating income decreased to SEK 6.3 (21.8) billion due to lower sales and lower gross margin, partly offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin was 2.8% (8.8%).
Financial net The financial net declined to SEK ­2.3 (­1.9) billion following decreased interest rates and depreciated local currencies in certain markets.
Taxes Tax cost decreased to SEK ­2.1 (­6.2) billion due to lower net income, offset by prior-year adjustments and non-deductible expenses. These factors resulted in a tax rate of 53% in 2016 compared with the more normal tax rate of 31% in 2015. Average tax rate for the years 2011­2015 was 32%.
Net income and EPS Net income decreased to SEK 1.9 (13.7) billion., for the same reasons as for the decrease in operating income. EPS diluted was SEK 0.52 (4.13) and EPS (Non-IFRS) was SEK 2.66 (6.06).

Ericsson Revenue Manager. The company invested SEK 0.6 (2.2) billion in acquisitions of smaller companies, such as Ericpol and NodePrime in 2016.
Cash flow from financing activities amounted to SEK ­11.7 billion, impacted by SEK ­12.3 billion of dividend payouts.
Financial position Net cash decreased to SEK 31.2 (41.2) billion due to lower income and increased dividends. The decrease was partly offset by reduced operating assets.
Pension liabilities increased by SEK 1.1 billion, due to decreased discount rates.
In 2016, Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ericsson's long-term rating from BBB+/Baa1 with stable outlook to BBB/Baa3 with negative outlook.
The average maturity of long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2016, was 3.8 years, compared with 4.8 years 12 months earlier. Ericsson has an unutilized Revolving Credit Facility of USD 2.0 billion. The facility expires in 2021. In addition, the company signed a new EUR 0.5 billion term loan facility in 2016. The new facility has a tenure of two years with one extension option of one year. The facility serves for general corporate purposes and is unutilized.
Intangible assets The amount of intellectual property rights and other intangible assets amounted to SEK 51.1 (50.4) billion, including goodwill of SEK 43.4 (41.1) billion. The goodwill impairment testing has been based on the new segments that became effective as per January 1, 2017. For the Media segment the headroom is SEK 5.6 billion when a discount of 8.0% is applied. The recoverable amount is equal to its carrying amount when the discount factor is increased to 10.0%. For more information, see Note 3 "Segment reporting" and Note 10 "Intangible assets."
Employees In 2016, the number of employees decreased by almost 5,000 driven by the ongoing cost and efficiency program. At year-end 2016, the total number of employees was 111,464 (116,281).

Research and development, patents and licensing In line with the global cost and efficiency program, the Company has decreased its R&D expenses. In 2016, R&D expenses amounted to SEK 31.6 (34.8) billion. The number of R&D resources increased mainly due to an acquisition of Ericpol, a long-time supplier to Ericsson with software development in Poland and Ukraine. Approximately 2,000 employees joined Ericsson from Ericpol. The number of patents continued to increase and amounted to approximately 42,000 by end of 2016.

Off-balance sheet arrangements There are currently no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or would be reasonably likely to have, a current or anticipated material effect on the Company's financial condition, revenues, expenses, result of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Capital expenditures For 2016, capital expenditure was SEK 6.1 (8.3) billion, representing 2.8% of sales. Expenditures are largely related to test sites and equipment for R&D, network operation centers and manufacturing and repair operations.
Investments have been made in three new global ICT centers. The centers will support R&D and services in developing and verifying solutions more efficiently and bringing innovation faster to the market. The first center, in Linköping, Sweden, was opened in 2014. The second center, in Rosersberg, Sweden, was opened in the beginning of 2016. The third center, in Montreal, Canada, was opened in December 2016. The level of capital expenditure will continue to decline as the investments in the Global ICT centers peaked in 2015.
In addition, Ericsson has invested in several buildings in Santa Clara, California and in Manchester, U.K. The purpose with the investments in Santa Clara is to consolidate Ericsson's Silicon Valley operations. In Manchester Ericsson is investing in a new dedicated customer technical facility for its broadcast media business. The new facility is expected to be ready in April 2017 and is part of a larger transformation and investment strategy.
Apart from these investments, Ericsson believes that the Company's property, plant and equipment and the facilities the Company occupies are suitable for its present needs.
Annual capital expenditures are normally around 2% of sales. This corresponds to the needs for keeping and maintaining the current capacity level. The Board of Directors reviews the Company's investment plans and proposals.
As of December 31, 2016, no material land, buildings, machinery or equipment were pledged as collateral for outstanding indebtedness.

"ColuBmunstyipnee". ss in 2016 Sales as reported decreased by ­12%. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales of mobile broadband, reduced sales of core networks and lower IPR licensing revenues. Core networks sales declined due to lower sales of legacy products, not offset by growth of the new portfolio. Mobile broadband investments were negatively impacted by a weak macroeconomic environment in a number of markets such as Latin America, the Middle East and South Africa. In

addition, sales declined in Europe following the completion of large coverage projects in 2015 and in India due to delayed spectrum auctions. The sales decline was partly offset by sales growth in South East Asia where large deliveries in mobile broadband coverage projects were made.
In North America and in North East Asia, investments in network equipment were stable. In Mainland China, large-scale LTE deployments continued for the third consecutive year.
Sales, adjusted for comparable units and currency, decreased by ­13%.
Operating income and margin decreased, mainly due to a lower share of mobile broadband capacity sales and lower IPR licensing revenues. The decrease was partly offset by reduced operating expenses, mainly as an effect of the ongoing cost and efficiency program. The work to improve profitability continued with significant headcount reductions and structural changes.
Restructuring charges amounted to SEK ­4.0 (­2.8) billion and the negative effect from currency hedge contracts was SEK ­0.7 (­0.9) billion.

several IT transformation contracts. However,

the short-term margin impact from these con-

tracts is challenging as a consequence of invest-

ments in competence build-up and market

global methods and tools.

Support Solutions Background Support Solutions represented 5.6% of net sales in 2016 (6.1% in 2015). The portfolio of Support Solutions is designed around measurable performance improvements in an operator's business processes, with software that is scalable, configurable and that provides end-to-end capabilities. The business segment develops and delivers software-based solutions for OSS and BSS as well as TV and media solutions.
Business in 2016 Sales as reported decreased by ­17%, partly due to lower IPR licensing revenues. OSS and BSS sales declined due to lower sales of legacy products and lower software sales in digital transformation projects where sales are mainly project milestone based. In addition, sales declined in markets with a weak macroeconomic environment.
Sales in TV & Media declined due to lower sales of legacy products primarily in North America. Customer trials on the next-generation TV & Media platform are ongoing, but have not yet translated into sales.
Operating income declined to SEK ­1.0 (1.5) billion mainly due to lower IPR licensing revenues and lower sales in both OSS and BSS as well as in TV & Media. Several activities in order to reduce cost and adjust the organization to lower business volumes are ongoing.
The overall transition of business models c ontinues, from traditional telecom software licenses to recurrent license revenue deals.

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Business results ­ Regions
North America Mobile broadband investments were stable. Professional Services sales were negatively impacted by reduced scope in a managed services contract. Support Solutions sales declined due to delayed investment decisions by customers. The focus on 5G strongly increased, with trials ongoing with all major customers.
Latin America Sales decreased following reduced mobile broadband investments due to a weak macroeconomic environment in the region and due to devaluation of local currencies. The strong momentum for digital transformation continued. Professional Services sales declined due to lower activities in managed services.
Northern Europe and Central Asia Sales declined, primarily due to continued lower mobile broadband investments in Russia. Global Services sales were flat with a decline in Network Rollout, offset by increased Managed Services sales in Sweden. OSS and BSS sales were flat while TV & Media sales declined.
Western and Central Europe Sales declined as the initial LTE deployments were finalized. Operators continue to focus on transforming their networks to meet the increasing demand for coverage and capacity, while at the same time improving efficiency.
Mediterranean Sales declined due to lower investments in mobile broadband infrastructure, mainly related to capacity business. Operator investments in ICT transformation and demand for managed services continued.

Middle East Sales declined, primarily in Networks due to lower broadband investments in Egypt, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Turkey. The decrease was partly offset by growth in Global Services sales, mainly in network rollout and optimization services in Saudi Arabia.
Sub-Saharan Africa Investments declined, impacted by a weak macroeconomic environment, local currency depreciation in key markets as well as low oil and commodity prices.
India Mobile broadband sales declined mainly driven by delayed spectrum auctions which delayed operator investments. Professional Services sales remained stable with operators' higher focus on network quality and cost optimization.
North East Asia Sales declined slightly due to lower investments in Mainland China and Korea, partly offset by market share gains in Japan and Taiwan. In Mainland China 4G deployments continued. However, reduced investments in legacy technologies and significantly reduced investment by one customer, impacted sales negatively.
South East Asia and Oceania Sales increased, primarily driven by mobile broadband deployments across several markets. Professional Services sales developed favorably as operators focus on efficiency and network optimization services.
Other IPR licensing revenues amounted to SEK 10.0 (14.4) billion. Sales in 2015 were positively impac ted by a global patent license agreement signed with Apple, which included an initial payment.

Corporate Governance
In accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the "Code"), a separate Corporate Governance Report, including an Internal Control section, has been prepared and attached to this Annual Report.
Continued compliance with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code Ericsson is committed to complying with best-practice corporate governance standards on a global level wherever possible. For 2016, Ericsson does not report any deviations from the Code.
Business integrity Ericsson's Code of Business Ethics summarizes the Group's basic policies and directives gov erning its relationships internally, with its stakeholders and with others. It also sets out how the Group works to secure that business activities are conducted with a strong sense of integrity.
Board of Directors At the Annual General Meeting, held on April 13, 2016, Leif Johansson was re-elected Chairman of the Board and Nora Denzel, Börje Ekholm, Ulf J. Johansson, Kristin Skogen Lund, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Hans Vestberg and Jacob Wallenberg were re-elected members of the Board. Helena Stjernholm and Kristin S. Rinne were elected new Board members and Roxanne S. Austin, Alexander Izosimov and Anders Nyrén left the Board. Hans Vestberg left his positions within Ericsson, including his Board position, as of July 25, 2016. As of April 13, 2016, Pehr Claesson, Mikael Lännqvist and Karin Åberg were appointed employee representatives by the unions, with Zlatko Hadzic, Roger Svensson and Kjell-Åke Soting as deputies.

Management Hans Vestberg left his position as President and CEO of the Group effective July 25, 2016 and was replaced by the Executive Vice President Jan Frykhammar. Effective January 16, 2017, Börje Ekholm was appointed new President and CEO of the Group. The President and CEO is supported by the Group management, consisting of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT).
A global management system is in place to ensure that Ericsson's business is well controlled and has the ability to fulfill the objectives of major stakeholders within established risk limits. The management system also monitors internal control and compliance with applicable laws, listing requirements and governance codes.
Remuneration Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors and to Group management, as well as the Guidelines for remuneration to Group manage ment resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2016, are reported in Notes to the consolidated financial statements ­ Note C28, "Information regarding members of the Board of Directors, the Group management and employees".
The Board of Directors' proposal for guidelines for remuneration to Group management The Board of Directors proposes that the 2017 Annual General Meeting of shareholders resolve on the guidelines below for remuneration to Group Management for the period up to the 2018 Annual General Meeting. Compared to the guidelines resolved by the 2016 Annual General Meeting, it has been added that targets for variable compensation may also include share price-related targets.

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Guidelines for Remuneration to Group Management For Group Management consisting of the Executive Leadership Team, including the President and CEO, total remuneration consists of fixed salary, short- and long-term variable compensation, pension and other benefits. The following guidelines apply for the remuneration of the Executive Leadership Team: >> Variable compensation is in cash and stock-
based programs, awarded against specific business targets derived from the long-term business plan approved by the Board of Directors. Targets may include share price- related or financial targets at either Group or unit level, operational targets, employee engagement targets or customer satisfaction targets. >> All benefits, including pension benefits, follow the competitive practice in the home country taking total compensation into account. >> By way of exception, additional arrangements can be made when deemed necessary. An additional arrangement can be renewed but each such arrangement shall be limited in time and shall not exceed a period of 36 months and twice the remuneration that the individual would have received had no additional arrangement been made. >> The mutual notice period may be no more than six months. Upon termination of employment by the Company, severance pay amounting to a maximum of 18 months fixed salary is paid. Notice of termination given by the employee due to significant structural changes, or other events that in a determining manner affect the content of work or the condition for the position, is equated with notice of termination served by the Company.
Executive Performance Stock Plan The Company has operated a Long-Term Variable Compensation program (LTV), building on a common platform of investment in, and matching of, Ericsson shares. It has consisted of three separate plans: one targeting all employees, one targeting key contributors and one targeting senior managers. The program has been designed to encourage long-term value creation in alignment with shareholders' interests. The aim of the plan for senior managers has been to attract, retain and motivate executives in a competitive market through performance-based share-related incentives and to encourage the build-up of significant equity stakes. The performance criteria for senior managers under the Executive Performance Stock Plan have been approved by the Annual General Meeting.
The targets for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Executive Performance Stock Plans are shown in the illustration on page 46. The performance criteria are:

Up to one-third of the award will vest if the target for compound annual growth rate of consolidated net sales is achieved.
Up to one-third of the award will vest if the target for compound annual growth rate of c onsolidated operating income, is achieved.
Up to one-third of the award will vest if cash conversion is at or above 70% during each of the years, vesting one-ninth of the award for each year the target is achieved. The cash conversion targets were reached in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Before the number of performance shares to be matched is finally determined, the Board of Directors shall examine whether the performance matching is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position, con ditions on the share market and other circumstances, and if not, reduce the number of per formance shares to be matched.
Since no Stock Purchase Plan will be proposed for 2017, alternative arrangements have been developed to replace the Executive Performance Stock Plan. For the Global Leadership Team, a share-based program is proposed for approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders ("AGM") 2017. Details of the per formance criteria are outlined in the notice of the AGM 2017.
Material contracts
Material contractual obligations are outlined in Note C31, "Contractual obligations." These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and were primarily related to operating leases for office and production facilities, purchase contracts for outsourced manufacturing, R&D and IT operations, and the purchase of components for the Company's own manufacturing. Ericsson is party to certain agreements, which include provisions that may take effect or be altered or invalidated by a change in control of the Company as a result of a public takeover offer. Such provisions are not unusual for certain types of agreements, such as for example financing agreements and certain license agreements. However, considering among other things the Company's strong financial position, the Company believes that none of the agreements currently in effect would in and of itself entail any material consequence for Ericsson due to a change in control of the Company.
Risk management
Risks are defined in both a short-term and longterm perspective. They are related to long-term objectives as per the strategic direction as well as short-term objectives for next coming year. Risks are categorized into industry and market risks, commercial risks, operational risks and compliance risks. Ericsson's risk management is

Financials ­ Board of Directors' report

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

47

FINANCIALS ­ Board of Directors' report

based on the following principles, which apply universally across all business activities and risk types: >> Risk management is an integrated part of
the Ericsson Group Management System. >> Each operational unit is accountable for own-
ing and managing its risks according to policies, directives and process tools. Decisions are made or escalated according to defined delegation of authority. Financial risks are coordinated through Group Function Finance. >> Risks are dealt with during the strategy process, annual planning and target setting, continuous monitoring through monthly and quarterly steering group meetings and during operational processes (customer projects, customer bid/contract, acquisition, investment and product development projects). They are subject to various controls such as decision tollgates and approvals.
At least twice a year, in connection with the approval of strategy and targets, risks are reviewed by the Board of Directors.
A central security unit coordinates management of certain risks, such as business interruption, information security and physical security. The Group Crisis Management Council deals with events of a serious nature.
For information on risks that could impact the fulfillment of targets and form the basis for mitigating activities, see the other sections of the Board of Directors' report, Notes C2 " Critical accounting estimates and judgments," C14 "Trade receivables and customer finance," C19 "Interest-bearing liabilities," C20 "Financial risk management and financial instruments" and the chapter Risk factors.
Sourcing and supply
Ericsson's hardware largely consists of electronics. For manufacturing, the Company purchases customized and standardized components and services from several global providers as well as from local and regional suppliers.
The production of electronic modules and sub-assemblies is mostly outsourced to manufacturing services companies, of which the vast majority are in low-cost countries. Final configuration of products is largely done in-house. This consists of assembling and testing modules and integrating them into complete units. Final assembly and testing are concentrated to a few sites. Ericsson has 10 manufacturing sites in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Mexico and Sweden.
A number of suppliers design and manufacture highly specialized and customized components. The Company generally negotiates global supply agreements with its primary suppliers. Ericsson's suppliers are required to comply with the requirements of Ericsson's Code of Conduct.

In general, Ericsson has alternative supply sources and seeks to avoid single source supply situations.
Variations in market prices for raw materials generally have a limited effect on total cost of goods sold. For more information, see the c hapter Risk factors.
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility (CR) are central to Ericsson's core business and the Company's commitment to the triple bottom line of responsible financial and environmental performance and socio-economic development. Ericsson's ambition is to be a relevant and responsible driver of positive change. The Company aims to do this by creating positive impacts in society and minimizing risks for stakeholders.
Ericsson's approach to Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility is integrated into business operations throughout the value chain; performance is regularly measured and assessed. The Board of Directors is briefed on Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility issues twice per year, or as needed on an ad hoc basis. Group policies and directives are implemented to ensure consistency across global operations. Ericsson's annual Sustain ability and Corporate Responsibility Report provides additional information.
Responsible business practices Since 2000, Ericsson has supported the UN Global Compact, endorses its ten principles regarding human rights and labor standards, anti-corruption and environmental protection, and reports its Communication on Progress at the Advanced level. In 2016, for the third year, Ericsson reported according to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework. The Ericsson Group Management System includes a Code of Business Ethics, a Code of Conduct, a Sustainability Policy and an Occupational Health and Safety Policy which reflect responsible business practices. These policies and practices are reinforced by employee awareness training and monitoring, and their implementation is externally assured.
Anti-corruption Ericsson's anti-corruption program, focused on prevention and accountability, is continuously strengthened. In 2016, that included: adding additional resources to the Compliance Office headed by the Chief Compliance Officer; launching an automated anti-corruption screening tool for conducting due diligence of suppliers and other third parties in Region Northern Europe and Central Asia, with global rollout

planned for 2017. Between 2013 and the end of 2016, more than 95,900 active employees completed an anti-corruption e-learning course.

Human rights

The Code of Business Ethics and Code of Con-

duct reflect the Company's ongoing commit-

ment to respect human rights. Ericsson works

actively to integrate the United Nations Guiding

Principles on Business and Human Rights into

its governance framework. Human rights due

diligence was strengthened in areas such as

Occupational health and safety (OHS) Providing a safe and healthy work environment is of paramount importance to Ericsson. The Company takes a transparent and inclusive approach, which includes engagement with suppliers. Ericsson has a special focus on suppliers building and servicing networks on behalf of Ericsson. The vision is zero major incidents.
OHS is integrated across operations globally, with a focus on awareness and prevention. In 2016, an Incident Review Board and Global OHS Board were established for overall governance of OHS.
Supporting climate action At the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in Marrakech, Morocco in 2016, industries joined world leaders to support the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016.
Ericsson is committed to develop and deliver solutions to support climate action. An ongoing priority is improving the life-cycle carbon footprint as part of a broader circular economy approach. The Company works to reduce negative environmental impacts while delivering solutions that enable a low-carbon economy. As energy use of products in operation remains the Company's most significant environmental impact, Ericsson works with mobile operators to encourage network and site energy optimization, through innovative products, software and solutions. Processes and controls are in place to ensure compliance with relevant product-related environmental, customer and regulatory requirements. An important aspect of Ericsson's Design for Environment initiatives is materials management and efficiency.
Ericsson has a long-term objective to maintain absolute CO2e emissions from its own activities for business travel, product transportation and facilities energy use in 2017 at the same level as in 2011. To achieve this long-term objective, the Company aims to reduce CO2e emissions per employee by 30% over five years. The Company achieved a 5% reduction of CO2e emissions per employee in 2016.
Over the past five years, CO2e emissions per employee have been reduced by 45% compared to a 2011 baseline. The company met its target to reduce twice as much societal CO2 emissions via its product and service offerings in areas such as utilities (smart meters) and transportation as emitted from Ericsson's own operations.
Radio waves and health Ericsson employs rigid product testing and installation procedures with the goal of ensuring that radio wave exposure levels from products

FINANCIALS ­ Board of Directors' report

and network solutions are below established safety limits. The Company also provides public information on radio waves and health, and supports independent research to further increase knowledge in this area. Since 1996, Ericsson has co-sponsored over 100 studies related to electromagnetic fields and health, primarily through the Mobile Manufacturers Forum.
To assure scientific independence, firewalls were in place between the industrial sponsors and the researchers conducting these studies. Independent expert groups and public health authorities, including the World Health Organization, have reviewed the total amount of research and have consistently concluded that the balance of evidence does not demonstrate any health effects associated with radio wave exposure from either mobile phones or radio base stations.
Reporting in accordance with GRI G4 core Ericsson publishes an annual Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report and full key performance data is made available on the Ericsson website according to the Global Report ing Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The performance data is assured by a third-party.
Legal proceedings
In March 2016, Ericsson and Adaptix Inc. (Adaptix) reached a settlement agreement, resolving all pending litigation between the parties including the patent infringement lawsuits filed by Adaptix against Ericsson with the US District Court for Eastern District of Texas and with the Tokyo District Court in Japan.
In 2013, Ericsson filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Delhi High Court against Indian handset company Micromax, seeking damages and an injunction. As part of its defense, Micromax filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the CCI has decided to refer the case to the Director General's Office for an in-depth investigation. In January 2014, the CCI opened another investigation against Ericsson based on claims made by Intex Technologies (India) Limited. Ericsson has challenged CCI's jurisdiction in these cases before the Delhi High Court and is waiting for a final decision by the Delhi High Court. Ericsson has made numerous attempts to sign a license agreement with both Micromax and Intex on Fair, Reasonable and Non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
In 2012, Wi-LAN Inc., a Canadian patent licensing company, filed a complaint against Ericsson in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that Ericsson's LTE products infringe three of Wi-LAN's US patents. On May 22, 2015, the Florida Court granted a Motion for Summary Judgment in favor of

Ericsson, which judgement was in January 2017 vacated by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the Federal Circuit's opinion.
In 2014, Ericsson was joined as a party to- litigation brought by Unwired Planet against Google, Samsung and Huawei in the English High Court in London, in which Unwired Planet accused the defendants of infringing certain p atents, some of which were purchased from Ericsson in 2013. Around the same time Ericsson has also intervened in the similar proceedings ongoing in the Dusseldorf District Court in which the defendants also include HTC and LG. The Defendants' counter-allegations included that the agreement entered into between Unwired Planet and Ericsson in 2013 for the sale of part of Ericsson's patent portfolio is invalid because of breach of competition law. Ericsson has rejected these claims. Unwired Planet has since settled its cases with Google and Samsung (both in the UK and Germany). In connection therewith these defendants' counter-claims against Ericsson have been discontinued.
In a decision issued in January, 2016, the Dusseldorf District Court found that there is no ground for the allegation that Ericsson' sale of patents to Unwired Planet is not in breach of competition law, and rejected this and all other allegations made by the defendants' against Ericsson. Ericsson remains as intervener in the German cases. This decision has been appealed.
Further, in October 2016 Huawei withdrew its counterclaim against Ericsson in the UK.
In addition to the proceedings discussed above, the Company is, and in the future may be, involved in various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of business.
Parent Company
The Parent Company business consists mainly of corporate management, holding company functions and internal banking activities. It also handles customer credit management, performed on a commission basis by Ericsson Credit AB.
The Parent Company has 5 (5) branch offices. In total, the Group has 79 (81) branch and representative offices.
Financial information Income after financial items was SEK 15.6 (16.8) billion. The Parent Company had no sales in 2016 or 2015 to subsidiaries, while 43% (43%) of total purchases of goods and services were from such companies.
Major changes in the Parent Company's financial position for the year included:

50

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

>> Increased current and non-current receivables from subsidiaries of SEK 17.1 billion.
>> Decreased gross cash of SEK 5.7 billion. >> Increased current and non-current liabilities
to subsidiaries of SEK 7.6 billion. At the end of the year, gross cash: cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and interest-bearing securities non-current amounted to SEK 42.9 (48.6) billion.
Share information As of December 31, 2016, the total number of shares in issue was 3,331,151,735, of which 261,755,983 were Class A shares, each carrying one vote, and 3,069,395,752 were Class B shares, each carrying one tenth of one vote. Both classes of shares have the same rights of participation in the net assets and earnings. The two largest shareholders at year-end were Investor AB and AB Industrivärden holding 21.77% and 15.15% respectively of the voting rights in the Parent Company.
In accordance with the conditions of the Long- Term Variable Compensation Program (LTV) for Ericsson employees, 13,275,251 treasury shares were distributed to employees or sold in 2016. The quotient value of these shares was SEK 5.00, totaling SEK 66.4 million, representing less than 1% of capital stock, and compensation received for shares sold and distributed shares amounted to SEK 137.8 million.
The holding of treasury stock at December 31, 2016 was 62,192,390 Class B shares. The quotient value of these shares is SEK 5.00, totaling SEK 311 million, representing 1.9% of capital stock, and the purchase price amounts to SEK 454.3 million.
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2016 resolved to issue 26.1 million Class C shares for the Long-Term Variable Remuneration Program (LTV). In accordance with an authorization from the AGM, in the second quarter 2016, the Board of Directors resolved to repurchase the new issued shares, which were subsequently converted into Class B shares. The quotient value of the repurchased shares was SEK 5.00, totaling SEK 130.5 million, representing less than 1% of capital stock, and the acquisition cost was approximately SEK 130.7 million.
Proposed disposition of earnings The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of SEK 1.00 (3.70) per share be paid to sharehol ders duly registered on the record date of March 31, 2017, and that the Parent Company shall retain the remaining part of non-restricted equity. The Class B treasury shares held by the Parent Company are not entitled to receive dividend. Assuming that no treasury shares remain on the record date, the Board of Directors proposes that earnings be distributed as follows:

Amount to be paid to the shareholders
Amount to be retained by the Parent Company
Total non-restricted equity of the Parent Company

SEK 3,331,151,735 SEK 41,420,521,393 SEK 44,751,673,128

As a basis for its dividend proposal, the Board of Directors has made an assessment in accordance with Chapter 18, Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act of the Parent Company's and the Group's need for financial resources as well as the Parent Company's and the Group's liquidity, financial position in other respects and longterm ability to meet their commitments. The Group reports an equity ratio of 49.6% (51.8%) and a net cash amount of SEK 31.2 (41.2) billion.
The Board of Directors has also considered the Parent Company's result and financial position and the Group's position in general. In this respect, the Board of Directors has taken into account known commitments that may have an impact on the financial positions of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.
The proposed dividend does not limit the Group's ability to make investments or raise funds, and it is the Board of Directors' assessment that the proposed dividend is well-balanced considering the nature, scope and risks of the business activities as well as the capital requirements for the Parent Company and the Group in addition to coming years' business plans and economic development.

FINANCIALS
notes to the CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

C1  Significant accounting policies
Introduction The consolidated financial statements comprise Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, the Parent Company, and its subsidiaries ("the Company") and the Company's interests in joint ventures and associated companies. The Parent Company is domiciled in Sweden at Torshamnsgatan 21, SE-164 83 Stockholm.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU and RFR 1 "Additional rules for Group Accounting," related interpretations issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board (Rådet för Finansiell Rapportering), and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. For the financial reporting of 2016, the Company has applied IFRS as issued by the IASB (IFRS effective as per December 31, 2016). There is no difference between IFRS effective as per December 31, 2016, and IFRS as endorsed by the EU, nor is RFR 1 related interpretations issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board (Rådet för Finansiell Rapportering) or the Swedish Annual Accounts Act in conflict with IFRS, for all periods presented.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on February 24, 2017. The balance sheets and income statements are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders.
Amendments applied as from January 1, 2016 There have not been any significant amendments of IFRS concerning the Company during 2016.
The following changes are not due to changes in IFRS:
Presentation in financial statements In the consolidated Balance sheet, Interest-bearing securities, non-current has been added as a new line and Short term investments has been renamed Interest-bearing securities, current. On the statement of Cash flow, the line Short-term investments has been renamed Interest-bearing securities.
Accounting for bonds Due to the conditions in the market for government and mortgage bonds in Sweden, Ericsson intends to hold bonds purchased in its "Asset management" portfolio until maturity instead of intending to hold them for trading. Bonds purchased in this portfolio after January 1, 2016 are determined to be classified as available-for-sale. Bonds held as available-forsale with a maturity longer than one year are included in Interest-bearing securities, non-current. Bonds held as available-for-sale with a maturity shorter than one year are included in Interest-bearing securities, current. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other comprehensive income. When these securities are derecognized, the accumulated fair value adjustments will be included in financial income.
Alternative Performance Measures, APMs Ericsson has applied the new guidelines issued by European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on APMs (Alternative Performance Measures). In summary, an APM is understood as a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in IFRS. The APMs presented in this annual report will be reconciled to the most directly reconcilable line items in the financial statements in the chapter "Other information ­ Alternative performance measures." The APMs presented in this report may differ from similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
For information on "New standards and interpretations not yet adopted," refer to the end of this Note.

Basis of presentation The financial statements are presented in millions of Swedish Krona (SEK). They are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that are stated at fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading, financial instruments classified as available-for-sale and plan assets related to defined benefit pension plans. Financial information in the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity with related notes are presented with two comparison years while for the consolidated balance sheet financial information with related notes is presented with only one comparison year.
Basis of consolidation and composition of the Group The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the purchase method. Accordingly, consolidated stockholders' equity includes equity in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies earned only after their acquisition.
Subsidiaries are all companies for which Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, directly or indirectly, is the parent. To be classified as a parent, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, directly or indirectly, must control another company which requires that the Parent Company has power over that other company, is exposed to variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to use its power over that other company. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that such control ceases.
Intra-group balances and any unrealized income and expense arising from intra-group transactions are fully eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
The Company is composed of a parent company, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, with generally fully-owned subsidiaries in many countries of the world. The largest operating subsidiaries are the fully-owned telecom vendor companies Ericsson AB, incorporated in Sweden and Ericsson Inc., incorporated in the US.
Business combinations At the acquisition of a business, the cost of the acquisition, being the purchase price, is measured as the fair value of the assets given, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, including any cost related to contingent consideration. Transaction costs attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The acquisition cost is allocated to acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities based upon appraisals made, including assets and liabilities that were not recognized on the acquired entity's balance sheet, for example intangible assets such as customer relations, brands, patents and financial liabilities. Goodwill arises when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of recognizable acquired net assets. In acquisitions with non-controlling interests full or partial goodwill can be recognized. Final amounts are established within one year after the transaction date at the latest.
In case there is a put option for non-controlling interest in a subsidiary a corresponding financial liability is recognized.
Non-controlling interest The Company treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Company. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
When the Company ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount

Financials ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

FINANCIALS ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest in an associate or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
At acquisition, there is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.

are recognized in the income statement, unless deferred in Other comprehensive income under the hedge accounting practices as described below.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-sale are analyzed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortized cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences related to changes in the amortized cost are recognized in profit or loss, and other changes in the carrying amount are recognized in OCI.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.

Joint ventures and associated companies Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for in accordance with the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in joint venture or associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. If the Company's interest in an associated company is nil, the Company shall not, as prescribed by IFRS, recognize its part of any future losses. Provisions related to obligations for such an interest shall, however, be recognized in relation to such an interest.
Investments in associated companies, i.e., when the Company has s ignificant influence and the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the associated company, but is not in control or joint control over those policies. Normally, this is the case in voting stock interest, including effective potential voting rights, which stand at least at 20% but not more than 50%.
The Company's share of income before taxes is reported in item "Share in earnings of joint ventures and associated companies," included in Operating Income. This reflects the fact that these interests are held for operating rather than investing or financial purposes. Ericsson's share of income taxes related to associated companies is reported under the line item "Taxes," in the income statement.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its joint ventures and associated companies are eliminated to the extent of the Company's interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Shares in earnings of joint ventures and associated companies included in consolidated equity which are undistributed are reported in Retained earnings in the balance sheet.
Impairment testing as well as recognition or reversal of impairment of investments in each joint venture and associated company is performed in the same manner as for intangible assets other than goodwill. The entire carrying value of each investment, including goodwill, is tested as a single asset. See also description under "Intangible assets other than goodwill" below.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
In Note C2, "Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments," further disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting policies applied.
Foreign currency remeasurement and translation Items included in the financial statements of each entity of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Swedish Krona (SEK), which is the Parent Company's functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of each respective transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies

Group companies The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet.
Period income and expenses for each income statement are translated at period average exchange rates.
All resulting net exchange differences are recognized as a separate component of Other comprehensive income (OCI).
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are accounted for in OCI. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in OCI are recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Company is continuously monitoring the economies with high inflation, the risk of hyperinflation and potential impact on the Company. There is no significant impact due to any currency translation of a hyper-inflationary economy.
Statement of cash flows The statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method. Cash flows in foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Payments for subsidiaries acquired or divested are reported as cash flow from investing activities, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired or disposed of respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, bank, and interest-bearing securities that are highly liquid monetary financial instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.
Revenue recognition Background The Company offers a comprehensive portfolio of telecommunication and data communication systems, professional services, and support solutions. Products, both hardware and software as well as services, are in general standardized. The impact of this is that any acceptance terms are normally only formal requirements. In Note C3, "Segment information," the Company's products and services are disclosed in more detail as per operating segment.
The Company's products and services are generally sold under delivery-type or multi-year recurring services contracts. The delivery type c ontracts often contain content from more than one segment.
Accounting treatment Sales are based on fair values of consideration received and recorded net of value added taxes, goods returned and estimated trade discounts. Revenue is recognized when risks and rewards have been transferred to the customer, with reference to all significant contractual terms, when: >> The product or service has been delivered >> The revenue amount is fixed or determinable >> The customer has received and activation has been made of separately
sold software >> Collection is reasonably assured

62

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Estimations of contractual performance criteria impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized and may therefore defer revenue recognition until the performance criteria are met. The profitability of contracts is periodically assessed, and provisions for any estimated losses are made immediately when losses are probable.
Allocation and/or timing criteria specific to each type of contract are: >> Delivery-type contracts ­ These contracts relate to delivery, installation,
integration of products and provision of related services, normally under multiple elements contracts. Under multiple elements contracts, accounting is based on that the revenue recognition criteria are applied to the separately identifiable components of the contract. Revenue, including the impact of any discount or rebate, is allocated to each element based on relative fair values. Networks, Global Services and Support Solutions have contracts that relate to this type of arrangement. >> Contracts for services ­ These relate to multi-year service contracts such as support- and managed service contracts and other types of recurring services. Revenue is recognized when the services have been provided, generally pro rata over the contract period. Global- Services has contracts that relate to this type of arrangement. >> Contracts generating license fees from third-parties for the use of the Company's intellectual property rights ­ License fees are measured based on the substance of the contract. Examples are a percentage of sales or currency amount per unit and recognized over the license period or at a single point of time when no obligations remain. The amount of consideration shall also be reasonably certain. Networks and Support Solutions have contracts that relate to this type of arrangement.
For sales between consolidated companies, associated companies, joint ventures and segments, the Company applies arm's length pricing.
In Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments," a further disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting policies applied.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to stockholders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (total number of shares less treasury stock) during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to stockholders of the Parent Company, when appropriately adjusted by the sum of the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding and dilutive potential ordinary shares. Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share.
Rights to matching shares are considered dilutive when the actual fulfillment of any performance conditions as of the reporting date would give a right to ordinary shares.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the settlement date.
Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Separate assets or liabilities are recognized if any rights and obligations are created or retained in the transfer.
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and availablefor-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.

The fair values of quoted financial investments and derivatives are based on quoted market prices or rates. If official rates or market prices are not available, fair values are calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. Valuations of foreign exchange options and Interest Rate Guarantees (IRG) are made by using the BlackScholes formula. Inputs to the valuations are market prices for implied volatility, foreign exchange and interest rates.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss either are designated as such at initial recognition or are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified as held for trading if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term.
Derivatives are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments for the purpose of hedge accounting. Assets held for trading are classified as current assets.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of the "Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss" category (excluding derivatives) are presented in the income statement within Financial income in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are presented in the income statement either as Cost of sales, Other operating income, Financial income or Financial expense, depending on the intent with the transaction.
Loans and receivables Receivables, including those that relate to customer financing, are sub sequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less allowances for impairment charges. Trade receivables include amounts due from customers. The balance represents amounts billed to customers as well as amounts where risk and rewards have been transferred to the customer but the invoice has not yet been issued.
Collectability of the receivables is assessed for purposes of initial revenue recognition.
Available-for-sale financial assets Investments in liquid bonds with low credit risk which are not held for trading are classified as available-for-sale. If the maturity is longer than one year the bonds are included in Interest-bearing securities, non-current. Bonds held as available-for-sale with a maturity shorter than one year are included in Interest-bearing securities, current. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in OCI. When these securities are derecognized, the accumulated fair value adjustments will be included in financial income. Under Introduction above the change as from 2016 is described.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognized in the income statement as part of financial income when the Company's right to receive payments is established.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in a foreign currency and classified as available-for-sale are analyzed between translation differences resulting from changes in the amortized cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences on monetary securities are recognized in profit or loss; translation differences on non-monetary securities are recognized in OCI. Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in OCI. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously recognized in OCI are included in the income statement.
Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as evidence that the security is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss ­ measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in profit or loss ­ is removed from OCI and recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.

FINANCIALS ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

An assessment of impairment of receivables is performed when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement within selling expenses. When a trade receivable is finally established as uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to selling expenses in the income statement.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes bound to the contractual obligations of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, i.e., when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently m easured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Fair value hedging and fair value hedge accounting The purpose of fair value hedges is to hedge the variability in the fair value of fixed-rate debt (issued bonds) from changes in the relevant benchmark yield curve for its entire term by converting fixed interest payments to a floating rate (e.g., STIBOR or LIBOR) by using interest rate swaps (IRS). The credit risk/spread is not hedged. The fixed leg of the IRS is matched against the cash flows of the hedged bond. Hereby, the fixed-rate bond/ debt is converted into a floating-rate debt in accordance with the policy.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, when hedge accounting is applied. The Company only applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on borrowings. Both gains and losses relating to the interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings and the changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognized in the income statement within Financial expenses. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortized to the income statement over the remaining period to maturity.
When applying fair value hedge accounting, derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at trade date and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
At the inception of the hedge, the Company documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging p urposes are disclosed in Note C20, "Financial risk management and

financial instruments." Movements in the hedging reserve in OCI are shown in Note C16, "Equity and other comprehensive income."
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Financial guarantees Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognized at fair value (i.e., usually the fee received). Subsequently, these contracts are measured at the higher of: >> The amount determined as the best estimate of the net expenditure
required to settle the obligation according to the guarantee contract. >> The recognized contractual fee less cumulative amortization when
amortized over the guarantee period, using the straight-line-method. >> The best estimate of the net expenditure comprising future fees and
cash flows from subrogation rights.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
Risks of obsolescence have been measured by estimating market value based on future customer demand and changes in technology and customer acceptance of new products.
A significant part of Inventories is Contract work in progress (CWIP). Recognition and derecognition of CWIP relates to the Company's revenue recognition principles meaning that costs incurred under a customer contract are recognized as CWIP. When revenue is recognized, CWIP is derecognized and is instead recognized as Cost of sales.
In Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments," further disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting policies applied.
Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill Intangible assets other than goodwill comprise intangible assets acquired through business combinations, such as patents, customer relations, trademarks and software, as well as capitalized development expenses and separately acquired intangible assets, mainly consisting of software. At initial recognition, acquired intangible assets related to business combinations are stated at fair value and capitalized development expenses and software are stated at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, these intangible assets are stated at initially recognized amounts less accumulated amortization and any impairment. Amortization and any impairment losses are included in Research and development expenses, which mainly consists of capitalized development expenses and technology; in Selling and administrative expenses, which mainly consists of expenses relating to customer relations and brands; and in Cost of sales.
Costs incurred for development of products to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed or intended for internal use are capitalized as from when technological and economic feasibility has been established until the product is available for sale or use. Research and development expenses directly related to orders from customers are accounted for as a part of Cost of sales. Other research and development expenses are charged to income as incurred. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, such as patents, customer relations, trademarks, and software, is made according to the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding ten years.
The Company has not recognized any intangible assets with indefinite useful life other than goodwill.
Impairment tests are performed whenever there is an indication of p ossible impairment. However, intangible assets not yet available for use are tested annually. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows after tax are discounted to their present value using an aftertax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time

64

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Application of after tax amounts in calculation, both in relation to cash flows and discount rate is applied due to that available models for calculating discount rate include a tax component. The after tax discount rate applied by the Company is not materially different from a discounting based on before-tax future cash flows and before-tax discount rates, as required by IFRS.
Corporate assets have been allocated to cash-generating units in relation to each unit's proportion of total net sales. The amount related to corporate assets is not significant. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts and if the recoverable amount is higher than the carrying value. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount after reversal does not exceed the carrying amount, net of amortization, which would have been reported if no impairment loss had been recognized.
In Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments," further disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting policies applied.
Goodwill As from the acquisition date, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each cash-generating unit (CGU) of the Company expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company's three operating segments have been identified as CGUs.
An annual impairment test for the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is performed in the fourth quarter, or when there is an indication of impairment. Impairment testing as well as recognition of impairment of goodwill is performed in the same manner as for intangible assets other than goodwill: see description under "Intangible assets other than goodwill" above. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
Additional disclosure is required in relation to goodwill impairment testing: see Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments" below and Note C10, "Intangible assets."
Property, plant, and equipment Property, plant, and equipment consist of real estate, machinery, servers and other technical assets, other equipment, tools and installation and construction in process and advance payment. They are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to income, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful life of each component of an item of property, plant, and equipment, including buildings. Estimated useful lives are, in general, 25­50 years for real estate and 3­10 years for machinery and equipment. Depreciation and any impairment charges are included in Cost of sales, Research and development or Selling and administrative expenses.
The Company recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant, and equipment the cost of replacing a component and derecognizes the residual value of the replaced component.
Impairment testing as well as recognition or reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment is performed in the same manner as for intangible assets other than goodwill: see description under "Intangible assets other than goodwill" above.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds less cost to sell with the carrying amount and are recognized within Other operating income and expenses in the income statement.
Leasing Leasing when the Company is the lessee Leases on terms in which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that type of asset, although the depreciation period must not exceed the lease term.
Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets under such contracts are not recognized on the balance sheet. Costs under operating

leases are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognized as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Leasing when the Company is the lessor Leasing contracts with the Company as lessor are classified as finance leases when the majority of risks and rewards are transferred to the lessee, and otherwise as operating leases. Under a finance lease, a receivable is recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and revenue is recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition principles.
Under operating leases the equipment is recorded as property, plant and equipment and revenue as well as depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Income taxes Income taxes in the consolidated financial statements include both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes are reported in the income statement unless the underlying item is reported directly in equity or OCI. For those items, the related income tax is also reported directly in equity or OCI. A current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable for the current year or prior years.
Deferred tax is recognized for temporary differences between the book values of assets and liabilities and their tax values and for tax loss carry- forwards. A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In the recognition of income taxes, the Company offsets current tax receivables against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities in the balance sheet, when the Company has a legal right to offset these items and the intention to do so. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and for differences related to investments in subsidiaries when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. An adjustment of deferred tax asset/liability balances due to a change in the tax rate is recognized in the income statement, unless it relates to a temporary difference earlier recognized directly in equity or OCI, in which case the adjustment is also recognized in equity or OCI.
The measurement of deferred tax assets involves judgment regarding the deductibility of costs not yet subject to taxation and estimates regarding sufficient future taxable income to enable utilization of unused tax losses in different tax jurisdictions. All deferred tax assets are subject to annual review of probable utilization.
In Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments," further disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting policies applied.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are made when there are legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events and when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and the amounts can be reliably estimated. When the effect of the time value of money is material, discounting is made of estimated outflows. However, the actual outflows as a result of the obligations may differ from such estimates.
The provisions are mainly related to warranty commitments, restructuring, customer projects and other obligations, such as unresolved income tax and value added tax issues, claims or obligations as a result of patent infringement and other litigations, supplier claims and customer finance guarantees.
Product warranty commitments consider probabilities of all material quality issues based on historical performance for established products and expected performance for new products, estimates of repair cost per unit, and volumes sold still under warranty up to the reporting date.
A restructuring obligation is considered to have arisen when the Com-

Financials ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

65

FINANCIALS ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

pany has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring (approved by management), which has been communicated in such a way that a valid expectation has been raised among those affected. Provision for restructuring is recorded when the Company can reliably estimate the liabilities relating to the obligation. Project related provisions include estimated losses on onerous contracts, contractual penalties and undertakings. For losses on customer contracts, a provision equal to the total estimated loss is recorded when a loss from a contract is anticipated and possible to estimate reliably. These contract loss estimates include any probable penalties to a customer under a loss contract.
Other provisions include provisions for unresolved tax issues, litigations, supplier claims, customer finance and other provisions. The Company provides for estimated future settlements related to patent infringements based on the probable outcome of each infringement. The actual outcome or actual cost of settling an individual infringement may vary from the Company's estimate.
The Company estimates the outcome of any potential patent infringement made known to the Company through assertion and through the Company's own monitoring of patent-related cases in the relevant legal systems. To the extent that the Company makes the judgment that an identified potential infringement will more likely than not result in an o utflow of resources, the Company records a provision based on the Company's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle with the counterpart.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other unresolved claims, including proceedings under laws and government regulations and other matters. These matters are often resolved over a long period of time. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes of these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses. Provisions are recognized when it is probable that an obligation has arisen and the amount can be reasonably estimated based on a detailed analysis of each individual issue.
Certain present obligations are not recognized as provisions as it is not probable that an economic outflow will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Such obligations are reported as contingent liabilities. For further detailed information, see Note C24, "Contingent liabilities." In Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments," further disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting policies applied.
Post-employment benefits Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the Company's only obligation is to pay a fixed amount to a separate entity (a pension trust fund) with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the employee. The expenditures for defined contribution plans are recognized as expenses during the period when the employee provides service.
Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Company's obligation to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the Company.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations for current and former employees is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The discount rate for each country is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds are used. The calculations are based upon actuarial assumptions, assessed on a quarterly basis, and are as a minimum prepared annually. Actuarial assumptions are the Company's best estimate of the variables that determine the cost of providing the benefits. When using actuarial assumptions, it is possible that the actual results will differ from the estimated results or that the actuarial assumptions will change from one period to another. These differences are reported as actuarial gains and losses. They are, for example, caused by unexpectedly high or low rates of employee turnover, changed life expectancy, salary changes, remeasurement of plan assets and changes in the discount rate. Actuarial gains and

losses are recognized in OCI in the period in which they occur. The Company's net liability for each defined benefit plan consists of the present value of pension commitments less the fair value of plan assets and is recognized net on the balance sheet. When the result is a net benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Interest cost on the defined benefit obligation and interest income on plan assets is calculated as a net interest amount by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. All past service costs are recognized immediately. Swedish special payroll tax is accounted for as a part of the pension cost and the pension liability respectively.
Payroll taxes related to actuarial gains and losses are included in determining actuarial gains and losses, reported under OCI.
In Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments," further disclosure is presented in relation to key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Share-based compensation to employees and the Board of Directors Share-based compensation is related to remuneration to all employees, including key management personnel and the Board of Directors.
Under IFRS, a company shall recognize compensation costs for sharebased compensation programs based on a measure of the value to the company of services received under the plans.
This value is based on the fair value of, for example, free shares at grant date, measured as stock price as per each investment date. The value at grant date is charged to the income statement as any other remuneration over the service period. For example, value at grant date is 90. Given the normal service period of three years within Ericsson, 30 would be charged per year during the service period.
The amount charged to the income statement is reversed in equity each time of the income statement charge.
The reason for this IFRS accounting principle is that compensation cost is a cost with no direct cash flow impact. The purpose of share-based accounting according to IFRS (IFRS 2) is to present the impact of sharebased programs, being part of the total remuneration, in the income statement.
Compensation to employeesStock purchase plans For stock purchase plans, compensation costs are recognized during the vesting period, based on the fair value of the Ericsson share at the employee's investment date. The fair value is based upon the share price at investment date, adjusted for the fact that no dividends will be received on matching shares prior to matching and other features that are non- vesting conditions. The employee pays a price equal to the share price at investment date for the investment shares. The investment date is considered as the grant date. In the balance sheet, the corresponding amounts are accounted for as equity. Vesting conditions are non-market-based and affect the number of shares that Ericsson will match. Other features of a share-based payment are non-vesting conditions. These features would need to be included in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees and others providing similar services. Non-vesting conditions would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuation thereof subsequent to grant date. When calculating the compensation costs for shares under performance-based matching programs, the Company at each reporting date assesses the probability that the performance targets will be met. Compensation expenses are based on estimates of the number of shares that will match at the end of the vesting period. When shares are matched, social security charges are to be paid in certain countries on the value of the employee benefit. The employee benefit is generally based on the market value of the shares at the matching date. During the vesting period, estimated amounts for such social security charges are expensed and accrued.
Compensation to the Board of Directors During 2008, the Parent Company introduced a share-based compensation program as a part of the remuneration to the Board of Directors. The program gives non-employee Directors elected by the General Meeting of Shareholders a right to receive part of their remuneration as a future payment of an amount which corresponds to the market value of a share of

66

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

class B in the Parent Company at the time of payment, as further disclosed in Note C28, "Information regarding members of the Board of Directors, the Group management and employees." The cost for cash settlements is measured and recognized based on the estimated costs for the program on a pro rata basis during the service period, being one year. The estimated costs are remeasured during and at the end of the service period.
Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of a company whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker, (CODM), to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. The President and the Chief Executive Officer is defined as the CODM function in the Company.
The segment presentation, as per each segment, is based on the Company's accounting policies as disclosed in this note. The arm's length principle is applied in transactions between the segments.
The Company's segment disclosure about geographical areas is based on the country in which transfer of risks and rewards occur.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of issued new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended December 31, 2016 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Below is a list of applicable standards/interpretations that have been issued and are effective for periods as described per standard.
IFRS 9, "Financial instruments." The complete version of IFRS 9 replaces most of the guidance in IAS 39. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies themixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurementcategories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through profit or loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. IFRS 9 also amends the principles for hedge accounting. This standard is effective as from January 1, 2018. The Company has not yet finalized the evaluation of any impact on financial result or position.
IFRS 15, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," establishes a new principle based model of recognizing revenue from customer contracts. This is a five-step model that requires revenue to be recognized as control over goods and services are transferred to the customer. IFRS 15 will be effective for implementation on January 1, 2018. The Company has e valuated the resulting changes to accounting principles and internal
p rocesses due to the new revenue recognition model and is currently
implementing the changes in line with the implementation date January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the implementation of the standard at transition date, including impact on the comparative numbers for prior reporting periods. This exercise is yet to be completed, therefore it is not practicably possible to disclose reliable estimates of the impact on financial statements at the transition date. The standard provides a choice of two transition methods, full retrospective or cumulative effect method. The full retrospective method requires restatement of prior year comparatives and adjustment to equity to the earliest presented comparative period, i.e. January 1, 2016, whereas with the cumulative effect method, the impact is adjusted to equity at the transition date of January 1, 2018. The Company has not decided on the transition method to be adopted at January 1, 2018 but will consider factors such as materiality of the impact on prior reporting periods (when reliably estimated), practicalities and costs of data gathering, in arriving at the decision.
IFRS 16 "Leases". In January 2016, IASB issued a new lease standard that will replace IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations IFRIC 4, SIC-15 and SIC-27. The standard requires assets and liabilities arising from all leases, with some exceptions, to be recognized on the balance sheet. This model reflects that, at the start of a lease, the lessee obtains the right to use an asset for a period of time and has an obligation to pay

for that right. The accounting for lessors will be based on the same classification as under IAS 17, operating or finance leasing. The definition of a lease is amended. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. EU has not yet adopted the standard. The Company will apply the new standard as from January 1, 2019. The initial assessment indicates that the main impact on the balance sheet is expected, where the Company is the lessee, primarily in contracts for real estate and vehicles.
C2  Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements and application of accounting standards often involve management's judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions deemed to be reasonable at the time they are made. However, other results may be derived with different judgments or using different assumptions or estimates, and events may occur that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected. Following are the most important accounting policies subject to such judgments and the key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Company believes could have the most significant impact on the reported results and financial position.
The information in this note is grouped as per: >> Key sources of estimation uncertainty >> Judgments management has made in the process of applying the
Company's accounting policies.
Revenue recognition Key sources of estimation uncertainty Examples of estimates of total contract revenue and cost that are nec essary are the assessing of customer possibility to reach conditional purchase volumes triggering contractual discounts to be given to the customer, the impact on the Company revenue in relation to performance criteria and whether any loss provisions shall be made. As disclosed in note C3 "Segment information" there is no customer for which revenues exceeds 10% of the Company's total revenue. It is, however, also disclosed that most of the sales are derived from large, multi-year agreements with a limited number of significant customers.
For further discussion on revenue recognition, see Note C1, "Significant accounting policies" and Note C4, "Net sales."
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied Parts of the Company's sales are generated from large and complex customer contracts. Managerial judgment is applied regarding, among other aspects, conformance with acceptance criteria and if transfer of risks and rewards to the buyer have taken place to determine if revenue and costs should be recognized in the current period, degree of completion and the customer credit standing to assess whether payment is likely or not to justify revenue recognition.
Trade and customer finance receivables Key sources of estimation uncertainty The Company monitors the financial stability of its customers and the environment in which they operate to make estimates regarding the likelihood that the individual receivables will be paid. Total allowances for estimated losses as of December 31, 2016, were SEK 1.7 (1.5) billion or 2.2% (2.0%) of gross trade and customer finance receivables. For further detailed information, see Note C14, "Trade receivables and customer finance."
Credit risks for outstanding customer finance credits are regularly assessed as well, and allowances are recorded for estimated losses.
Inventory valuation Key sources of estimation uncertainty Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Estimates are required in relation to forecasted sales volumes and inventory balances. In situations where excess inventory balances are identified,

Financials ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

67

FINANCIALS ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

estimates of net realizable values for the excess volumes are made. Inventory allowances for estimated losses as of December 31, 2016, amounted to SEK 2.4 (2.6) billion or 7% (8%) of gross inventory. For further detailed information, see Note C13, "Inventories."
Deferred taxes Key sources of estimation uncertainty Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences and for tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax is recognized net of valuation allowances. The valuation of temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards, is based on management's estimates of future taxable profits in different tax jurisdictions against which the temporary differences and loss carry-forwards may be utilized.
The largest amounts of tax loss carry-forwards are reported in Sweden, with an indefinite period of utilization (i.e. with no expiry date). For further detailed information, please refer to Note C8, "Taxes."
At December 31, 2016, the value of deferred tax assets amounted to SEK 15.5 (13.2) billion. The deferred tax assets related to loss carry-forwards are reported as non-current assets.
Accounting for income tax, value added tax, and other taxes Key sources of estimation uncertainty Accounting for these items is based upon evaluation of income, value added and other tax rules in all jurisdictions where the Company performs activities. The total complexity of rules related to taxes and the accounting for these require management's involvement in judgments regarding classification of transactions and in estimates of probable outcomes of claimed deductions and/or disputes.
Acquired intellectual property rights and other intangible assets, including goodwill Key sources of estimation uncertainty At initial recognition, future cash flows are estimated, to ensure that the initial carrying values do not exceed the expected discounted cash flows for the items of this type of assets. After initial recognition, impairment testing is performed whenever there is an indication of impairment, except in the case of goodwill for which impairment testing is performed at least once per year. Negative deviations in actual cash flows compared to estimated cash flows as well as new estimates that indicate lower future cash flows might result in recognition of impairment charges.
For further discussion on goodwill, see Note C1, "Significant accounting policies" and Note C10, "Intangible assets." Estimates related to acquired intangible assets are based on similar assumptions and risks as for goodwill. In Note C10 "Intangible assets," it is disclosed that for the Media segment the headroom is SEK 5.6 billion when a discount of 8.0% is applied. The recoverable amount is equal to its carrying amount when the discount factor is increased to 10.0%. For more information, see Note C10, "Intangible assets."
At December 31, 2016, the amount of acquired intellectual property rights and other intangible assets amounted to SEK 51.1 (50.4) billion, including goodwill of SEK 43.4 (41.1) billion.
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied At initial recognition and subsequent remeasurement, management judgments are made, both for key assumptions and regarding impairment indicators. In the purchase price allocation made for each acquisition, the purchase price shall be assigned to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities based on fair values for these assets. Any remaining excess value is reported as goodwill.
This allocation requires management judgment as well as the definition of cash-generating units for impairment testing purposes. Other judgments might result in significantly different results and financial position in the future.

Provisions Key sources of estimation uncertainty Provisions mainly comprise amounts related to restructuring, warranty, contractual obligations and penalties to customers and estimated losses on customer contracts, risks associated with patent and other litigations, supplier or subcontractor claims and/or disputes, as well as provisions for unresolved income tax and value added tax issues. In relation to restructuring, the Company is executing a cost and efficiency program that was first initiated in the last quarter of 2014 and then expanded in the second quarter of 2016. The estimates related to the amounts of provisions for restructuring, penalties, claims or losses receive special attention from the management. At December 31, 2016, provisions amounted to SEK 6.4 (3.8) billion. For further detailed information, see Note C18, "Provisions."
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied Whether a present obligation is probable or not requires judgment. The nature and type of risks for these provisions differ and management's judgment is applied regarding the nature and extent of obligations in deciding if an outflow of resources is probable or not.
Contingent liabilities Key sources of estimation uncertainty As disclosed under `Provisions' there are uncertainties in the estimated amounts. The same type of uncertainty exists for contingent liabilities.
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied As disclosed under Note C1, "Significant accounting policies" a potential obligation that is not likely to result in an economic outflow is classified as a contingent liability, with no impact on the Company's financial statements. However, should an obligation in a later period be deemed to be probable, then a provision shall be recognized, impacting the financial statements.
Pension and other post-employment benefits Key sources of estimation uncertainty Accounting for the costs of defined benefit pension plans and other applicable post-employment benefits is based on actuarial valuations, relying on key estimates for discount rates, future salary increases, employee turnover rates and mortality tables. The discount rate assumptions are based on rates for high-quality fixed-income investments with durations as close as possible to the Company's pension plans. In countries where there is not a deep market in high-quality corporate bonds, the market yields on government bonds shall be applied. As of 2015, due to the market situation in Sweden, the Company has applied yields on Swedish government bonds for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation in Sweden. The discount rate applied in Sweden was 1.8% (2.1%). At December 31, 2016, defined benefit obligations for pensions and other post-employment benefits amounted to SEK 87.2 (78.1) billion and fair value of plan assets to SEK 64.5 (58.2) billion. For more information on estimates and assumptions, see Note C17, "Post-employment benefits."
Foreign exchange risks Key sources of estimation uncertainty Foreign exchange risk impacts the financial results of the Company: see further disclosure in Note C20, "Financial risk management and financial instruments," under Foreign exchange risk.

C3  Segment information
Operating segments When determining Ericsson's operating segments, consideration has been given to which markets and what type of customers the products and services aim to attract, as well as the distribution channels they are sold through. Commonality regarding technology, research and development has also been taken into account. To best reflect the business focus and to facilitate comparability with peers, three operating segments are reported: >> Networks >> Global Services >> Support Solutions >> (Modems, closed during second half of 2015)
Networks delivers products and solutions for mobile access, IP and transmission networks, core networks and cloud. The offering includes: >> Radio access solutions that interconnect with devices such as mobile
phones, tablets and PCs. >> IP routing and transport solutions including routers, Ericsson's evolved
IP network as well as backhaul including microwave (MINI-LINK) and optical transmission solutions for mobile and fixed networks >> Core networks are based on the Ericsson Blade Server platform and include solutions such as the IMS >> A cloud platform that can handle all types of workloads for all clouds; telecom cloud, IT cloud and commercial cloud.
Global Services delivers managed services, product-related services, consulting and systems integration services as well as broadcast and media services. The offering includes: >> Managed Services: Services for designing, building, operating and
managing the day-to-day operations of the customer's network or solution; maintenance; network sharing solutions; plus shared solutions such as hosting of platforms and applications. Ericsson also offers managed services of IT environments. >> Product-related services: Services to expand, upgrade, restructure or migrate networks; network-rollout services; customer support; network design and optimization services. >> Consulting and Systems Integration: Technology and operational c onsulting; integration of multi-vendor equipment; design and integration of new solutions and transforming programs. >> Broadcast Services: Services include responsibility for technical platforms and operational services related to TV content management, playout and service provisioning.
Support Solutions provides software suites for operators. The offering includes: >> Operations Support Systems: plan, build and optimize, service fulfill-
ment and service assurance. >> Business Support Systems: revenue management (prepaid, post-paid,
convergent charging and billing), mediation and customer care solutions. >> TV & Media solutions: a suite of open, standards-based solutions and
products for the creation, management and delivery of TV on any device over any network, including a TV platform for content creation, content management, on-demand video delivery, advanced video compression and video-optimized delivery network infrastructure. >> M-Commerce solutions for money transfer: payment transactions and services between mobile subscribers and operators or other service providers.
Modems performed design, development and sales of the LTE multimode thin modems solutions, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability. Modems was consolidated into Ericsson in late 2013. Since the integration, the addressable market for thin modems has been reduced. In addition, there is strong competition, price erosion and an accelerating pace of technology innovation. As a consequence, Ericsson announced, on September 18, 2014, the discontinuation of further development of modems. Modems have had no impact on Group profit and loss from the second half of 2015.

Unallocated Some revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are not identified as part of any operating segment and are therefore not allocated. Examples of such items are costs for corporate staff, IT costs and general marketing costs.
Regions The Regions are the Company's primary sales channel. The Company operates worldwide and reports its operations divided into ten geographical regions and one region Other: >> North America >> Latin America >> Northern Europe & Central Asia >> Western and Central Europe >> Mediterranean >> Middle East >> Sub-Saharan Africa >> India >> North East Asia >> South East Asia & Oceania >> Other.
Region "Other" includes licensing revenues, broadcast services, power modules, mobile broadband modules, Ericsson-LG Enterprise and other businesses.
Major customers The Company does not have any customer for which revenues from transactions have exceeded 10% of the Company's total revenues for the years 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Ericsson derives most of its sales from large, multi-year agreements with a limited number of significant customers. Out of a customer base of more than 500, mainly consisting of network operators, the 10 largest customers accounted for 46% (46%) of net sales. The largest customer accounted for approximately 7% (7%) of sales in 2016.
For more information, see Risk Factors, "Market, Technology and Business Risks."
Marketing channels Marketing in a business-to-business environment is expanding, from being primarily conducted through personal meetings, to on-line forums, expert blogs and social media. Ericsson performs marketing through: >> Customer engagement with a consultative approach >> Selective focus on events and experience centers for customer experi-
ence and interaction >> Continuous dialogue with customers and target audiences through
social and other digital media (including virtual events) >> Activation of the open social and digital media landscape to strengthen
message reach and impact >> Execution of solutions-driven programs, aligned globally
and regionally.
New segment structure from January 1, 2017 From January 1, 2017, segment reporting is based on a new structure, with three new operating segments: >> Segment Networks. Products and services with a focus on evolving
and managing our customers' telecom networks. The portfolio of radio networks and backhaul solutions are based on industry standards and can also be industrialized and adjusted to meet the demands of other industry verticals as utilities, transport and public safety. In addition, Ericsson services capabilities address operator demand in an increasingly complex network environment. >> Segment IT & Cloud. Products and services providing solutions for our customers' digital transformation journeys across the Support Systems, Telecom core and IT Cloud domains through a combination of products, technology and expertise in networks, software, cloud and business processes. >> Segment Media. Products and services that enable content owners, broadcasters, TV service providers and network operators to efficiently deliver, manage and monetize new TV experiences.

Tax effects reported directly in Other comprehensive income amount to SEK 521 (721) million, of which actuarial gains and losses related to p ensions constituted SEK 520 (721) million.
Deferred tax assets are only recognized in countries where the Company expects to be able to generate corresponding taxable income in the future to benefit from tax reductions.
Significant tax loss carry-forwards are related to countries with long or indefinite periods of utilization, mainly Sweden and Germany. Of the total SEK 4,883 (4,241) million recognized deferred tax assets related to tax loss carry-forwards, SEK 3,774 (3,378) million relates to Sweden with indefinite periods of utilization. The assessment is that the Company will be able to generate sufficient income in the coming years to also utilize the remaining part of the recognized amounts.

Tax loss carry-forwards Deferred tax assets regarding tax loss carry-forwards are reported to the extent that realization of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable also when considering the period during which these can be utilized, as described below.
As of December 31, 2016, the recognized tax loss carry-forwards amounted to SEK 20,929 (18,162) million. The tax value of these tax loss c arry-forwards is reported as an asset.
The final years in which the recognized tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized are shown in the following table.

In addition to the table above there are tax loss carry-forwards of SEK 3,936 (5,300) million at a tax value of SEK 950 (1,436) million that have not been recognized due to judgments of the possibility they will be used against future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions. The majority of these tax loss carry-forwards have an expiration date in excess of five years.

The goodwill impairment testing is based on five-year business plans. The testing has been based on the new segments that became effective as per January 1, 2017 due to that the business plans where prepared for the new segments. In Note C3 "Operating segments" information about the new segments is disclosed.
The total goodwill for the Company is SEK 43.4 (41.1) billion and is allocated to the new operating segments Networks, at the sum of SEK 26.2 (n/a) billion, IT & Cloud, at the sum of SEK 9.8 (n/a) billion and Media, at the sum of SEK 7.4 (n/a) billion. The allocation of goodwill to the new segments has been done using a relative value approach, except for the goodwill related to one acquisition where the alternative approach has been used.
The recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are established as the present value of expected future cash flows. Estimation of future cash flows includes assumptions mainly for the following key financial parameters: >> Sales growth >> Development of operating income (based on operating margin or cost
of goods sold and operating expenses relative to sales) >> Development of working capital and capital expenditure requirements. >> The assumptions regarding industry-specific market drivers and mar-
ket growth are approved by Group management and each operating segment's management. These assumptions are based on industry sources as input to the projections made within the Company for the development 2016­2021 for key industry parameters: >> The number of global mobile subscriptions is estimated to grow from around 7.9 billion by the end of 2016 to around 9.9 billion by the end of 2021 (including Cellular M2M). Of these, around 7.9 billion will be mobile broadband subscriptions, taking mobile PC, tablets, routers and Cellular connected Internet of Things devices and handsets into account. Out of all phone subscriptions, 6.4 billion will be associated with a smartphone. >> The overall number of connected things will grow to around 26 billion devices in 2021, including also M2M and connected consumer electronics.

>> Mobile data traffic volume is estimated to increase by around six times in the period 2016­2021. The mobile traffic is driven by smartphone users and video traffic. Smartphone traffic will grow by around seven times, and video traffic will grow around eight times in the period of 2016­2021. The assumptions are also based upon information gathered in the
Company's long-term strategy process, including assessments of new technology, the Company's competitive position and new types of business and customers, driven by the continued integration of telecom, data and media industries.
The impairment testing is based on specific estimates for the first five years and with a reduction of nominal annual growth rate to an average GDP growth of 1% (3%) per year thereafter. The impairment tests for goodwill did not result in any impairment.
An after-tax discount rate of 8.0% (8.5%) has been applied for the d iscounting of projected after-tax cash flows. The same rate has been applied for all cash-generating units, since there is a high degree of integration between them. In addition, when a reasonably higher discount rate of 10.0% has been applied in the impairment tests, headroom for Networks and IT & Cloud is still positive.
For the Media segment the headroom is SEK 5.6 billion when a discount of 8.0% is applied. The recoverable amount is equal to its carrying amount when the discount factor is increased to 10.0%.
Group sales of media products and services declined in 2016 due to lower sales of legacy products. The transition to next-generation platform is ongoing with several customer trials. However, this has not yet translated into sales. Mobile video consumption is growing rapidly however there are significant M&A activities ongoing in the industry impacting purchasing behavior and the short- to mid-term addressable market growth.
The assumptions for 2015 are disclosed in Note C10, "Intangible assets" in the Annual Report of 2015.
The Company's discounting is based on after-tax future cash flows and after-tax discount rates. This discounting is not materially different from a discounting based on before-tax future cash flows and before-tax discount rates, as required by IFRS. In Note C1, "Significant accounting policies," and Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments," further disclosures are given regarding goodwill impairment testing.

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Credit risk Credit risk is divided into three categories: credit risk in trade receivables, customer finance risk and financial credit risk, see Note C20, "Financial risk management and financial instruments."
Credit risk in trade receivables Credit risk in trade receivables is governed by a policy applicable to all legal entities in the Company. The purpose of the policy is to: >> Avoid credit losses through establishing internal standard credit
approval routines in all the Company's legal entities >> Ensure monitoring and risk mitigation of defaulting accounts, i.e. events
of non-payment and/or delayed payments from customers >> Ensure efficient credit management within the Company and thereby
improve Days sales outstanding and Cash flow >> Define escalation path and approval process for customer credit limits.
The credit worthiness of all customers is regularly assessed. Through credit management system functionality, credit checks are performed every time a sales order or an invoice is generated in the source system. These are based on the credit risk set on the customer. Credit blocks appear if past due receivables are higher than permitted levels. Release of a credit block requires authorization.
Letters of credits are used as a method for securing payments from customers operating in emerging markets, in particular in markets with unstable political and/or economic environments. By having banks c onfirming the letters of credit, the political and commercial credit risk exposures to the Company are mitigated.
Trade receivables amounted to SEK 69,430 (72,208) million as of December 31, 2016. Provisions for expected losses are regularly assessed and amounted to SEK 1,403 (1,202) million as of December 31, 2016. The Company's nominal credit losses have, however, historically been low. The amounts of trade receivables closely follow the distribution of the Company's sales and do not include any major concentrations of credit risk by customer or by geography. The five largest customers represented 27% (30%) of the total trade receivables in 2016.
Customer finance credit risk All major commitments to finance customers are made only after approval by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, according to the established credit approval process.
Prior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating of each transaction, for political and commercial risk. The credit risk analysis is made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD. The commercial risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure. The output from the assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk. This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over funding cost. The reference pricing for political and commercial risk, on which the tool is based, is reviewed using information from Export Credit Agencies and prevailing pricing in the bank loan market for structured financed deals. The objective is that the internally set risk m argin shall reflect the assessed risk and that the pricing is as close as possible to the current market pricing. A reassessment of the credit rating for each customer finance facility is made on a regular basis.
Risk provisions related to customer finance risk exposures are only made upon events which occur after the financing arrangement has become effective and which are expected to have a significant adverse impact on the borrower's ability and/or willingness to service the outstanding debt. These events can be political (normally outside the control of the borrower) or commercial, e.g. a borrower's deteriorated creditworthiness.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company's total outstanding exposure related to customer finance was SEK 5,003 (4,066) million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of SEK 13,082 (11,101) million. Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different geographic markets and for a large

number of customers. As of December 31, 2016, there were a total of 81 (91) customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company. The five largest facilities represented 55% (50%) of the total credit exposure in 2016.

The effect of risk provisions and reversals for customer finance affecting the income statement amounted to a net negative impact of SEK 24 million in 2016 compared to a net positive impact of SEK 33 million in 2015. C redit losses amounted to SEK 108 (47) million in 2016.
Security arrangements for customer finance facilities normally include pledges of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges of shares in the operating company. If available, third-party risk coverage is, as a rule, arranged. "Third-party risk coverage" means that a financial payment guarantee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency or other financial institution. A credit risk cover from a third-party may also be issued by an insurance company. A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrangement with a bank can also be arranged. In this case the entire credit risk and the funding is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover.
Information about guarantees related to customer finance is included in Note C24, "Contingent liabilities," and information about leasing is included in Note C27, "Leasing."
The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding customer finance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Transfers of financial assets Transfers where the Company has not derecognized the assets in their entirety As of December 31, 2016, there existed no customer financing assets that the Company had transferred to third parties where the Company did not derecognize the assets in their entirety. However, it existed such transactions in 2015. The total carrying amount of the original assets transferred was in 2015 SEK 534 million; the amount of the assets that the Company continued to recognize in 2015 was SEK 27 million; and the carrying amount of the associated liabilities was SEK 0.
Transfers where the Company has continuing involvement During 2016, the Company derecognized financial assets where it had continuing involvement. A repurchase of these assets would amount to SEK 630 (0) million. No assets or liabilities were recognized in relation to the continuing involvement.

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

C17  Post-employment benefits
Ericsson sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans throughout the Company, which are in line with market practice in each country. The year 2016 was characterized by a decrease in discount rates in most plans. In total, discount rate changes resulted in actuarial losses on defined benefit obligations of SEK 9 billion. The development of plan assets was greater than expected resulting in actuarial gains of SEK 4 billion.

Alecta has a collective funding ratio which acts as a buffer for its insurance commitments to protect against fluctuations in investment return and insurance risks. Alecta's target ratio is 140% and reflects the fair value of Alecta's plan assets as a percentage of plan commitments, then meas ured in accordance with Alecta's actuarial assumptions, which are different from those in IAS 19R. Alecta's collective funding ratio was 149% (153%) as of December 31, 2016. The Company's share of Alecta's saving pre miums is 0.6%; the total share of active members in Alecta are 2.2%. The expected contribution to the plan is SEK 136 million for 2017.

Swedish plans Sweden has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans based on collective agreement between the parties in the Swedish labor market: >> A defined benefit plan, known as ITP 2 (occupational pension for sala-
ried employees in manufacturing industries and trade), complemented by a defined contribution plan, known as ITPK (supplementary retirement benefits). This is a final salary-based plan. >> A defined contribution plan, known as ITP 1, for employees born in 1979 or later. >> A defined contribution plan ITP 1 or alternative ITP, for employees earning more than 10 income base amount and who have opted out of the defined benefit plan ITP 2, where rules are set by the Company and approved by each employee selected to participate.
The Company has by far most of its Swedish pension liabilities under defined benefit plans which are funded to 55% (52%) through Ericsson Pensionsstiftelse (a Swedish Pension Foundation). The Pensionsstiftelse covers the liability up to the value of the defined benefit obligation based on Swedish GAAP calculations. There are no funding requirements for the Swedish plans. The disability and survivors' pension part of the ITP-plan is secured through an insurance solution with the company Alecta, see section about Multi-employer plans.
The benefit payments are made by the Company since the liability is growing and the necessary surplus therefore is not yet reached. For the unfunded plans the Company meets the payment obligation when it falls due. The responsibility for governance of the plans and the plan assets lies with the Company and the Pensionsstiftelse. The Swedish Pensions stiftelse is managed on the basis of a capital preservation strategy and the risk profile is set accordingly. Traditional asset-liability matching (ALM) studies are undertaken on a regular basis to allocate within different asset classes.
The plans are exposed to various risks, e.g., a sudden decrease in the bond yields, which would lead to an increase in the plan liability. A sudden instability in the financial market might also lead to a decrease in fair value of plan assets held by the Pensionsstiftelse, as the holdings of plan assets partly are exposed to equity markets; however, this may be partly offset by higher values in fixed income holdings. Swedish plans are linked to inflation and higher inflation will most likely lead to a higher liability. For the time being, inflation is a low risk factor to the Swedish plans as actual rate of inflation has not reached the ceiling target set by the Central Bank of Sweden.

Contingent liabilities / Assets pledged as collateral Contingent liabilities include the Company's mutual responsibility as a credit insured company of PRI Pensionsgaranti in Sweden. This mutual responsibility can only be imposed in the instance that PRI Pensions garanti has consumed all of its assets, and it amounts to a maximum of 2% of the Company's pension liability in Sweden. The Company has a pledged business mortgage of SEK 2 billion to PRI Pensionsgaranti.
US plans The Company operates defined benefit pension plans in the US, which are a combination of final salary pension plans and contribution-based arrangements. The final salary pension plans provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on members' length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. Retirees generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
The other type of plan is a contribution-based pension plan, which provides a benefit determined using a "cash balance" approach. The balance is credited monthly with interest credits and contribution credits, based on a combination of current year salary and length of service.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee-administered funds; however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where the Company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. In the US, the Company's policy is at least to meet or exceed the funding requirements of federal regulations. The funded level in the US Pension Plan is above the point at which minimum funding would be required for fiscal year 2016.
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice, as is the nature of the relationship between the Company and the trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Responsibility for govern ance of the plans ­ including investment decisions and contribution schedules ­ lies with the Plan Administrative Committee (PAC). The PAC is composed of representatives from the Company.
The Company's plans are exposed to various risks associated with pension plans, i.e., a sudden decrease in bond yields would lead to an increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation. A sudden instability in the financial markets might also lead to a decrease in the fair value of plan assets held by the trust. Pension benefits in the US are not linked to inflation; however, higher inflation poses the risk of increased final salaries being used to determine benefits for active employees. There is also a risk that the duration of payments to retirees will exceed the life expectancy in mortality tables.

Multi-employer plans As before, the Company has secured the disability and survivors' pension part of the ITP Plan through an insurance solution with the insurance company Alecta. Although this part of the plan is classified as a multi-employer defined benefit plan, it is not possible to get sufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting, as for most of the accrued pension benefits in Alecta, information is missing on the allocation of earnings process between employers. Full vesting is instead registered on the last employer. Alecta is not able to calculate a breakdown of assets and pro visions for each respective employer, and therefore, the disability and s urvivors' pension portion of the ITP Plan has been accounted for as a defined contribution plan.

Other plans The Company also sponsors plans in other countries. The main plans are in Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The plan in Brazil is a pension plan wholly funded with a net surplus of assets. The plans in Ireland and the UK are final salary pension plans and are partly or wholly funded. The plans are managed by corporate trustees with directors appointed partly by the local company and partly by the plan members. The trustees are independent from the local company and subject to the specific country's pension laws.

Provisions will fluctuate over time depending on business mix, market mix and technology shifts. Risk assessment in the ongoing business is performed monthly to identify the need for new additions and reversals. During certain years the Company undertakes restructuring activities that may require recognition of provisions. Management uses its best judgment to estimate provisions based on this assessment. Under certain c ircumstances, provisions are no longer required due to outcomes being more favorable than anticipated, which affect the provisions balance as a reversal. In other cases, the outcome can be negative, and if so, a charge is recorded in the income statement.
For 2016, new or additional provisions amounting to SEK 6.3 billion were made, and SEK 0.7 billion of provisions were reversed. The actual cash outlays for 2016 were SEK 3.2 billion compared with the estimated SEK 2.5 billion. The total cash out for 2016 was made up of warranty provisions of SEK 0.4 billion, restructuring provisions of SEK 2.4 billion and other provisions of SEK 0.3 billion. The expected total cash outlays in 2017 are approximately SEK 4.4 billion.
Of the total provisions, SEK 946 (176) million is classified as non-current. For more information, see Note C1, "Significant accounting policies" and Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments."
Warranty provisions Warranty provisions are based on historic quality rates for established products as well as estimates regarding quality rates for new products and costs to remedy the various types of faults predicted. Provisions amounting to SEK 0.3 billion were made and due to more favorable o utcomes in certain cases reversals of SEK 0.2 billion were made.

The actual cash outlays for 2016 were SEK 0.4 billion, in line with the expected SEK 0.4 billion. The cash outlays of warranty provisions during year 2017 are estimated to total approximately SEK 0.1 billion.
Restructuring provisions In 2016, SEK 5.3 billion in provisions were made and SEK 0.1 billion were reversed due to a more favorable outcome than expected. Provisions were mainly related to the cost and efficiency program initially announced in November 2014. The scope of the structural efficiency measures involves service delivery, supply and manufacturing, R&D and SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative expenses). The cash outlays for restructuring provisions were SEK 2.4 billion for the full-year, compared with the expected SEK 1.2 billion. The cash outlays for 2017 for these provisions are estimated to total approximately SEK 3.2 billion.
Other provisions Other provisions include provisions for probable contractual penalties, tax issues, litigations, supplier claims, and other. During 2016, new pro visions amounting to SEK 0.8 billion were made and SEK 0.4 billion were reversed due to a more favorable outcome. The cash outlays were SEK 0.3 billion in 2016 compared to the estimate of SEK 0.8 billion. For 2017, the cash outlays for other provisions are estimated to total approximately SEK 1.1 billion.

To secure long-term funding, the Company uses notes and bond programs together with bilateral research and development loans. All outstanding notes and bond loans are issued by the Parent Company under its Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) program or under its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registered program. Bonds issued at a fixed interest rate are normally swapped to a floating interest rate using interest rate swaps leaving a maximum of 50% of outstanding loans at fixed interest rates. Total weighted average interest rate cost for the longterm funding during the year was 2.76% (2.58%). The outstanding EUR bond is revalued based on changes in benchmark interest rates according to the fair value hedge methodology stipulated in IAS 39.
In June 2016, the Company exercised its first extension option under the USD 2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, extending the maturity date to June 2021. One extension option of one year remains.
In November 2016, the Company signed a new EUR 0.5 billion term loan facility. The new facility has a tenor of two years with one extension option of one year and the facility serves for general corporate purposes.

C20 Financial risk management and financial instruments

The Company's financial risk management is governed by a policy approved by the Board of Directors. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the capital structure and financial management of the Company and approving certain matters (such as investments, customer finance commitments, guarantees and borrowing) and continuously monitors the exposure to financial risks.
The Company defines its managed capital as the total Company equity. For the Company, a robust financial position with a strong equity ratio, solid investment grade rating, low leverage and ample liquidity is deemed important. This provides financial flexibility and independence to operate and manage variations in working capital needs as well as to capitalize on business opportunities.
The Company's overall capital structure should support the financial targets: to grow faster than the market, deliver best-in-class margins and generate a healthy cash flow. The capital structure is managed by balancing equity, debt financing and liquidity in such a way that the Company can secure funding of operations at a reasonable cost of capital. Regular borrowings are complemented with committed credit facilities to give additional flexibility to manage unforeseen funding needs. The Company strives to finance growth, normal capital expenditures and dividends to shareholders by generating cash flows from operating activities.

Hedging activities, cash management and insurance management are largely centralized to the treasury function in Stockholm.
The Company also has a customer finance function with the main objective to find suitable third-party financing solutions for customers and to minimize recourse to the Company. To the extent that customer loans are not provided directly by banks, the Parent Company provides or guarantees vendor credits. The customer finance function monitors the exposure from outstanding vendor credits and credit commitments.
The Company classifies financial risks as: >> Foreign exchange risk >> Interest rate risk >> Credit risk >> Liquidity and refinancing risk >> Market price risk in own and other equity instruments.
The Board of Directors has established risk limits for defined exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate risks as well as to political risks in certain countries.
For further information about accounting policies, see Note C1, " Significant accounting policies."

The Company's capital objectives are: >> To maintain an equity ratio above 40% >> A cash conversion rate above 70% >> To maintain a positive net cash position larger than the pension liability >> To maintain a solid investment grade rating by Moody's

The definition of Net cash has been adjusted in order to more clearly represent Ericsson's ability to meet financial obligations. Post-employment benefits are no longer included in the calculation of Net cash. Interest-bearing securities, non-current are now included in Net cash because these are liquid instruments with low credit risk. The revised definition is as follows:
Net cash: Cash and cash equivalents plus interest-bearing securities (current and non-current) less interest-bearing liabilities (which include: non-current borrowings and current borrowings).
In October 2016, Moody's announced that they have downgraded the senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa2 from Baa1 and the MTN program rating to Baa2 from Baa1. At the same time, the agency placed the company's Baa2/Baa2 ratings on review for further downgrade. In December 2016, Moody's concluded their review and announced that they have downgraded the senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa3 from Baa2 and the MTN program rating to Baa3 from Baa2, with a negative outlook. In October 2016, S&P announced that they have downgraded the long-term corporate credit rating on Ericsson to BBB from BBB+, with a negative outlook.
The Company has a treasury function with the principal role to ensure that appropriate financing is in place through loans and committed credit facilities, actively managing the Company's liquidity as well as financial assets and liabilities, and managing and controlling financial risk exposures in a manner consistent with underlying business risks and financial policies.

Foreign exchange risk The Company is a global company with sales mainly outside Sweden. Sales and incurred costs are to a large extent denominated in currencies other than SEK and therefore the financial results of the Company are impacted by currency fluctuations.
The Company reports the financial statements in SEK. Movements in exchange rates between currencies that affect these statements are impacting the comparability between periods.
Line items, primarily sales, are impacted by translation exposure incurred when converting foreign entities' financial statements into SEK. Line items and profitability, such as operating income are impacted by transaction exposure incurred when financial assets and liabilities, p rimarily trade receivables and trade payables, are initially recognized and subsequently remeasured due to change in foreign exchange rates.
The table below presents the net exposure for the largest curr encies impact on sales and also net transaction exposure of these currencies on profitability.

Translation exposure Translation exposure relates to sales and cost incurred in foreign entities when converted into SEK upon consolidation. These exposures cannot be addressed by hedging, but as the income statement is translated using average rate, the impact of volatility in foreign currency rates is reduced.

Transaction exposure Transaction exposure relates to sales and cost incurred in non-reporting currencies in individual group companies. Foreign exchange risk is as far as possible concentrated in Swedish group companies, primarily Ericsson AB. Sales to foreign subsidiaries are normally denominated in the functional currency of the customers, and so tend to be denominated in

Financials ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

FINANCIALS ­ Notes to the consolidated financial statements

USD or another foreign currency. In order to limit the exposure toward exchange rate fluctuations on future revenues and costs, committed and forecasted future sales and purchases in major currencies are hedged with 7% of 12-month forecast monthly. By this, the Company will have hedged 84% of the next month and 7% of the 12th month of an average forecast of the individual month at any given reporting date. This corre sponds to approximately 5­6 months of an average forecast.
Outstanding derivatives contracts that are hedging future sales and costs incurred are revalued against "Other operating income and expense." The sensitivity in "Other operating income and expense" in relation to this revaluation is dependent on changes in foreign exchange rates, forecasts, seasonality and hedging policy. USD is the Company's largest exposure and at year-end a change by 0.25 SEK/USD would impact profit and loss with approximately SEK 0.3 billion. Revaluation results of these derivative contracts amounted to SEK ­0.4 billion in 2016.
According to Company policy, transaction exposure in subsidiaries' balance sheets (i.e., trade receivables and payables and customer finance receivables) should be fully hedged, except for non-tradable currencies.
Foreign exchange exposures in balance sheet items are hedged through offsetting balances or derivatives.

Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk through market value fluct uations in certain balance sheet items and through changes in interest revenues and expenses. The net cash position was SEK 31.2 (41.2) billion at the end of 2016, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and interest- bearing securities of SEK 57.9 (66.3) billion, interest-bearing liabilities of SEK 26.7 (25.1).
The Company manages the interest rate risk by i) matching fixed and floating interest rates in interest-bearing balance sheet items and ii) avoiding significant fixed interest rate exposure in the Company's net cash position. The policy is that interest-bearing assets shall have an average interest duration of between 6 and 14 months, taking derivative instruments into consideration. Interest-bearing liabilities do not have a firm target for the duration, nor a firm target for fixed/floating interest rate, as duration and interest mix are decided based on market conditions when the liabilities are issued. The treasury function has a mandate to deviate from the asset management benchmark given by the Board and take foreign exchange positions up to an aggregated risk of VaR SEK 45 million given a confidence level of 99% and a 1-day horizon.

When managing the interest rate exposure, the Company uses derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps. Derivative instruments used for converting fixed rate debt into floating rate debt are designated as fair value hedges.

Sensitivity analysis The Company uses the VaR methodology to measure foreign exchange and interest rate risks in portfolios managed by the treasury function. This statistical method expresses the maximum potential loss that can arise with a certain degree of probability during a certain period of time. For the VaR measurement, the Company has chosen a probability level of 99% and a 1-day time horizon. The daily VaR measurement uses market volatilities and correlations based on historical daily data (one year).
The average VaR calculated for 2016 was SEK 16.3 (11.7) million for the combined mandates. No VaR-limits were exceeded during 2016.

Financial credit risk Financial instruments carry an element of risk in that counterparts may be unable to fulfill their payment obligations. This exposure arises in the investments in cash, cash equivalents, interest-bearing securities and from derivative positions with positive unrealized results against banks and other counterparties.
The Company mitigates these risks by investing cash primarily in wellrated securities such as treasury bills, government bonds, commercial papers, and mortgage-covered bonds with short-term ratings of at least A-2/P-2 or equivalents, and long-term ratings of AAA. Separate credit limits are assigned to each counterpart in order to minimize risk concentration. All derivative transactions are covered by ISDA netting agreements to reduce the credit risk.
At December 31, 2016, the credit risk in financial cash instruments was equal to the instruments' carrying value. Credit exposure in derivative instruments was SEK 1.1 (1.4) billion.

Liquidity risk The Company minimizes the liquidity risk by maintaining a sufficient cash position, centralized cash management, investments in highly liquid interest-bearing securities, and by having sufficient committed credit lines in place to meet potential funding needs. For information about contractual obligations, see Note C31, "Contractual obligations." The current cash position is deemed to satisfy all short-term liquidity requirements as well as non-current borrowings.

Instruments held for trading with a remaining maturity longer than one year amounted to SEK 12.0 billion and were reported as Interest-bearing securities, current.

Refinancing risk Refinancing risk is the risk that the Company is unable to refinance outstanding debt under reasonable terms and conditions, or at all, at a given point in time.

Debt financing is mainly carried out through borrowing in the Swedish and international debt capital markets.

Fair valuation of the Company's financial instruments The Company's financial instruments accounted for at fair value generally meet the requirements of level 1 valuation due to the fact that they are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Exceptions to this relates to: >> OTC derivatives with an amount of gross SEK 1.2 (1.8) billion in relation
to assets and gross SEK 0.9 (1.3) billion in relation to liabilities were valued based on references to other market data as currency or interest rates. These valuations fall under level 2 valuation as defined by IFRS. >> Ownership in other companies and other financial investments where the Company neither has control nor significant influence. The amount recognized in these cases was SEK 2.1 (2.1) billion. These assets, classified as level 3 assets for valuation purposes, have been valued based on value in use technique.

Financial instruments carried at other than fair value The fair value of the Company's financial instruments, recognized at fair value, is determined based on quoted market prices or rates. For further information about valuation principles, see Note C1, "Significant accounting policies."
Financial instruments, such as trade receivables, borrowings and payables, are carried at amortized cost which is deemed to be equal to fair value, except for those noted in the table Notes, bonds, bilateral loans and committed credits in Note C19, "Interest-bearing liabilities." When a market price is not readily available and there is insignificant interest rate exposure and credit spreads affecting the value, the carrying value is c onsidered to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Market price risk in own shares and other listed equity investments The Company is exposed to fluctuations in its own share price through stock purchase plans for employees and synthetic share-based com pensations to the Board of Directors.
Stock purchase plans for employees The obligation to deliver shares under the stock purchase plan is covered by holding Ericsson Class B shares as treasury stock. A change in the share price will result in a change in social security charges, which represents a risk to the income statement. The cash flow exposure is fully hedged through the holding of Ericsson Class B shares as treasury stock to be sold to generate funds, which also cover social security payments.
Synthetic share-based compensations to the Board of Directors In the case of these plans, the Company is exposed to risks in relation to own share price, both with regards to compensation expenses and social security charges. The obligation to pay compensation amounts under the synthetic share-based compensations to the Board of Directors is covered by a liability in the balance sheet.
For further information about the stock purchase plan and synthetic share-based compensations to the Board of Directors, see Note C28, "Information regarding members of the Board of Directors, the Group management and employees."
Offsetting financial assets and liabilities As required by IFRS, the Company has off set financial instruments under ISDA agreements. The related assets amounted to SEK 1.2 (1.8) billion, prior to offsetting of SEK 0.1 (0.4) billion, with a net amount of SEK 1.1 (1.4) billion recognized in the balance sheet. The related liabilities amounted to SEK 0.9 (1.3) billion, prior to offsetting of SEK 0.1 (0.4) billion, with a net amount of SEK 0.8 (0.9) billion recognized in the balance sheet.

In 2016, Ericsson made acquisitions with a negative cash flow effect amounting to SEK 781 (1,867) million. The acquisitions presented below are not material but the Company gives the information to provide the reader a summarized view of the content of the acquisitions made. The acquisitions consist primarily of:

FYI Television: On January 25, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in FYI Television, a US based premier entertainment metadata and rich media content supplier based in Grand Prairie, Texas, with approximately 150 employees. The acquisition makes it possible to combine FYI Television's US-market expertise and reach with Ericsson's experience in content discovery in Europe, which is a key component of Ericsson's TV and Media strategy to improve the video experience in a multiscreen world. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are final.

Ericpol: On April 13, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in Ericpol a software development company in Poland within telecommunications who has been a supplier to Ericsson for over 20 years. Approximately 2,000 employees joined the Company. With the acquisition of Ericpol's operations in Poland and Ukraine, the Company secures well integrated software development competence within radio, cloud and IP to enable business continuity. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are preliminary.

Nodeprime: On April 15, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in Nodeprime a US based company, with an infrastructure management platform, designed to support the command and control of the complete ecosystem of components in today's existing datacenters.

1) The difference in value as of the time for payment, compared to December 31, 2015, for synthetic shares allocated in 2011 (for which payment was made in 2016). The difference in value as of December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015, for synthetic shares allocated in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Calculated on a share price of SEK 53.50. The difference in value as of December 31, 2016, compared to grant date for synthetic shares allocated in 2016. The value of synthetic shares allocated in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 includes respectively SEK 2.75, SEK 3.00, SEK 3.40 and SEK 3.70 per share in compensation for dividends resolved by the Annual General Meetings 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the value of the synthetic shares allocated in 2011 includes dividend compensation for dividends resolved in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
2) Committee fee and cash portion of the Board fee. 3) The Board remuneration resolved by the annual general meeting of shareholders is only for non-employee Board members. Since Börje Ekholm is employed by the Company as President and CEO
since January 16, 2017, his shareholder resolved remuneration has been adjusted accordingly. 4) In addition, an amount corresponding to statutory social charges in respect of the part of the fee that has been invoiced from a business was paid, amounting to SEK 1,406,045. 5) In addition, an amount corresponding to statutory social charges in respect of the part of the fee that has been invoiced from a business was paid, amounting to SEK 210,514. 6) In addition, an amount corresponding to statutory social charges in respect of the part of the fee that has been invoiced from a business was paid, amounting to SEK 219,224. 7) Excluding social security charges and amounts invoiced through a business corresponding to such social security charges in to the amount of SEK 2,248,324. 8) Including synthetic shares previously allocated to the former Directors Roxanne S. Austin and Alexander Izosimov. 9) Including synthetic shares previously allocated to the former Director Nancy McKinstry and Sir Peter L. Bonfield. For these synthetic shares, the net change in value corresponds to the difference in
value as of the time for payment compared to December 31, 2015.

Comments to the table >> The Chairman of the Board was entitled to a Board fee of SEK
4,075,000 and a fee of SEK 200,000 for each Board Committee on which he served as Chairman. >> The other Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting were entitled to a fee of SEK 990,000 each. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee was entitled to a fee of SEK 350,000 and the other non-employee members of the Audit Committee were entitled to a fee of SEK 250,000 each. The Chairmen of the Finance and Remuneration Committees were entitled to a fee of SEK 200,000 each and the other non-employee members of the Finance and the Remuneration Committees were entitled to a fee of SEK 175,000 each. >> Members of the Board, who are not employees of the Company, have not received any remuneration other than the fees and synthetic shares as above. None of the Directors have entered into a service contract with the Parent Company or any of its subsidiaries, providing for termination benefits. >> Members and deputy members of the Board who are Ericsson employees received no remuneration or benefits other than their entitlements as employees and a fee to the employee representatives and their deputies of SEK 1,500 per attended Board meeting, and Committee meeting. >> Board members invoicing for the amount of the Board and Committee fee from a business may add to the invoice an amount corresponding to

social charges. The social charges thus included in the invoiced amount are not higher than the general payroll tax that would otherwise have been paid by the Company. The entire amount, i.e., the cash portion of the Board fee and the Committee fee, including social charges, constitutes the invoiced Board fee. >> The Annual General Meeting 2016 resolved that non-employee Directors may choose to receive the Board fee (i.e., exclusive of Committee fee) as follows: i) 25% of the Board fee in cash and 75% in the form of synthetic shares, with a value corresponding to 75% of the Board fee at the time of allocation, ii) 50% in cash and 50% in the form of synthetic shares, or iii) 75% in cash and 25% in the form of synthetic shares. Directors may also choose not to participate in the synthetic share program and receive 100% of the Board fee in cash. Committee fees are always paid in cash.
The number of synthetic shares allocated is based on a volume-weighted average of the market price of Ericsson Class B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of Ericsson's interim report for the first quarter 2016; SEK 66.93. The number of synthetic shares is rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares.
The synthetic shares are vested during the Directors' term of office and the right to receive payment with regard to the allocated synthetic shares occurs after the publication of the Company's year-end financial statement during the fifth year following the Annual General Meeting which

94

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

resolved on the synthetic share program, i.e., in 2021. The amount payable shall be determined based on the volume-weighted average price for shares of Class B during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the year-end financial statement.
Synthetic shares were allocated to members of the Board for the first time in 2008 and have been allocated annually since then on equal terms and conditions. Payment based on synthetic shares allocated in 2011 occurred in 2016 and, in accordance with the terms and conditions for the synthetic share advance payment was then also made to the former Director Sir Peter L. Bonfield. The amounts paid in 2016 under the synthetic share programs were determined based on the volume-weighed average price for shares of Class B on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately following the publication of the year-end financial statements for 2015: SEK 74.68 and totalled SEK 2,245,951 excluding social security charges. The payments made do not constitute a cost for the Company in 2016. The Company's costs for the synthetic shares have been disclosed each year and the net change in value of the synthetic shares for which payment was made in 2016, is disclosed in the table "Remuneration to members of the Board of Directors" on page 94. The value of all outstanding synthetic shares fluctuates in line with the market value of Ericsson's Class B share and may differ from year to year compared to the original value on their respective grant dates. The change in value of the outstanding synthetic shares is established each

year and affects the total recognized costs that year. As of December 31, 2016, the total outstanding number of synthetic shares under the programs is 138,105 and the total accounted debt is SEK 8,207,895 (including synthetic shares previously allocated to the former Directors Roxanne S. Austin and Alexander Izosimov).
Remuneration to the Group management The Company's costs for remuneration to the Group management are the costs recognized in the Income statement during the fiscal year. These costs are disclosed under "Remuneration costs" below.
Costs recognized during a fiscal year in the Income statement are not fully paid by the Company at the end of the fiscal year. The unpaid amounts that the Company has in relation to the Group management are disclosed under "Outstanding balances."
Remuneration costs The total remuneration to the President and CEO and to other members of the Group management, consisting of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), includes fixed salary, short- and long-term variable compensation, pension and other benefits. These remuneration elements are based on the guidelines for remuneration to Group management as approved by the Annual General Meeting held in 2016: see the approved guidelines in section "Guidelines for remuneration to Group management 2016."

In addition, Arun Bansal, Niklas Heuveldop, Chris Houghton, Fredrik Jejdling, Anders Lindblad, Jean-Philippe Poirault, Charlotta Sund and Elaine Weidman- Grunewald all joined ELT on July 1, 2016. Carl Mellander joined ELT on July 25, 2016 and MajBritt Arfert joined ELT on November 15, 2016. >> The salary stated in the table for the President and CEO and other members of the ELT includes vacation pay paid during 2016 as well as other contracted compensation expensed in 2016. During 2016, a decision was taken by the Remuneration Committee to pay out saved vacation balances. These payments are included in salaries stated above. >> The remuneration costs for 2016 includes termination provisions, including estimates of future severance pay and compensation for unused vacation, in respect of individuals who left Ericsson during 2016.

For the former President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, the contractual severance pay amounted to 18 months' salary (SEK 21,206,863 excluding social charges and taxes). >> "Long-term variable compensation provision" refers to the compensation costs during 2016 for all outstanding share-based plans. >> For the former President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, and other members of the ELT employed in Sweden before 2011, a supplementary plan is applied in addition to the occupational pension plan for salaried staff on the Swedish labor market (ITP) with pension payable from the age of 60 years.

Comments to the table >> For the definition of matching rights, see the description in section
"Long-term variable compensation". >> Matching result of 39.7% is included for the 2013 plan. >> Cash conversion targets for 2014, 2015 and 2016 were reached. >> During 2016, the two serving Presidents and CEOs received 90,086
matching shares and other members of the ELT received 122,648 matching shares.
Option agreements Prior to taking office as President and CEO of Ericsson, Board member Börje Ekholm entered into an option agreement with Investor AB and AB Industrivärden, shareholders of Ericsson. Each of these two shareholders has issued 1,000,000 call options to Börje Ekholm on market terms (valuation conducted, using the Black & Scholes model, by an independent third party). Under the agreements, Börje Ekholm has purchased in total 2,000,000 call options, issued by the shareholders, for a purchase price of SEK 0.49 per call option. Each call option entitles the purchase of one Ericsson B share from the shareholders at a strike price of SEK 80 per share during one year after a seven-year period. Since the President and CEO has the power to influence the dividend paid by the Company, a potential conflict of interest exists. The option agreements therefore c ontain a strike price recalculation mechanism which is intended to make the options payoff neutral regardless of what the actual dividends are. Due to the fact that the call options were purchased on market terms as described above, no compensation expense has been recognized by the Company and will not be recognized during the remaining part of the seven-year period.
Guidelines for remuneration to Group management 2016 For Group management consisting of the Executive Leadership Team, including the President and CEO, total remuneration consists of fixed s alary, short- and long-term variable compensation, pension and other benefits.
The following guidelines apply to the remuneration of the Executive Leadership Team: >> Variable compensation is in cash and stock-based programs awarded
against specific business targets derived from the long-term business plan approved by the Board of Directors. Targets may include financial targets at either Group or unit level, operational targets, employee engagement targets or customer satisfaction targets. >> All benefits, including pension benefits, follow the competitive practice in the home country taking total compensation into account. >> By way of exception, additional arrangements can be made when deemed necessary. An additional arrangement can be renewed but each such arrangement shall be limited in time and shall not exceed a period of 36 months and twice the remuneration that the individual would have received had no additional arrangement been made. >> The mutual notice period may be no more than six months. Upon termination of employment by the Company, severance pay amounting to a maximum of 18 months fixed salary is paid. Notice of termination given by the employee due to significant structural changes, or other events that in a determining manner affect the content of work or the condition for the position, is equated with notice of termination served by the Company.

Long-Term Variable compensation The Stock Purchase Plan The Stock Purchase Plan has been designed to offer an incentive for all employees to participate in the Company where practicable. For the 2016 plan, employees are able to save up to 7.5% of their gross fixed salary (The former President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, could save up to 10% of gross fixed salary and short-term variable remuneration) for purchase of Class B contribution shares at market price on Nasdaq Stockholm or American Depositary Shares (ADSs) on NASDAQ New York (contribution shares) during a twelve-month period (contribution period). If the contribution shares are retained by the employee for three years after the investment and their employment with the Ericsson Group continues during that time, then the employee's shares will be matched with a corresponding number of Class B shares or ADSs free of consideration. Employees in 100 countries participate in the plans.
The table below shows the contribution periods and participation details for ongoing plans as of December 31, 2016.

Participants save each month, beginning with the August payroll, towards quarterly investments. These investments (in November, February, May and August) are matched on the third anniversary of each such investment, subject to continued employment, and hence the matching spans over two financial years and two tax years.
No Stock Purchase Plan is being proposed for 2017.
The Key Contributor Retention Plan The Key Contributor Retention Plan is part of Ericsson's talent management strategy and is designed to give recognition for performance, critical skills and potential as well as to encourage retention of key employees. Under the program, up to 10% of employees (2016 plan: 10,742 employees nominated) are selected through a nomination process that identifies individuals according to performance, critical skills and potential. Participants selected obtain one extra matching share in addition to the ordinary one matching share for each contribution share purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan during a twelve-month period.
Since no Stock Purchase Plan will be proposed for 2017, alternative arrangements will be developed to replace the Key Contributor Plan.

The Executive Performance Stock Plan The Executive Performance Stock Plan has been designed to focus management on driving earnings and provide competitive remuneration. Senior managers, including ELT, were selected to obtain up to four or six extra shares (performance matching shares) in addition to the ordinary one matching share for each contribution share purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan. Up to 0.5% of employees (2016 plan: 509 executives) are offered participation in the plan. The former President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, could save up to 10% of gross fixed salary and short-term variable compensation, and could obtain up to nine performance-matching shares in addition to the Stock Purchase Plan matching share for each contribution share. The performance targets are linked to growth of Net Sales, Operating Income and Cash Conversion.
The table "Executive Performance Stock Plan targets" show ongoing Executive Performance Stock Plans as of December 31, 2016.
Since no Stock Purchase Plan will be proposed for 2017, alternative arrangements will be developed to replace the Executive Performance Stock Plan. For the Global Leadership Team, a share-based arrangement is proposed for approval by the 2017 Annual General Meeting of shareholders.

1) Shares under the Executive Performance Stock Plans were based on the fact that the 2012 plan came out at 33%, in casu 67% lapsed and that the 2013 plan vested for 39.7% and lapsed for 60.3%. For the other ongoing plans, cost is estimated.
2) Fair value is calculated as the share price on the investment date, reduced by the net present value of the dividend expectations during the three-year vesting period. Net present value calculations are based on data from external party. For shares under the Executive Performance Stock Plans, the company makes a forecast for the fulfillment of the financial targets for all ongoing plans except for 2012 and 2013 plans as disclosed under 1) when calculating the compensation cost. Fair value of the Class B share at each investment date during 2016 was: February 15 SEK 63.62, May 15 SEK 50.52, August 15 SEK 50.39 and November 15 SEK 38.83.
3) Total compensation costs charged during 2015: SEK 865 million, 2014: SEK 717 million.

Shares for all plans All plans are funded with treasury stock and are equity settled. Treasury stock for all plans has been issued in directed cash issues of Class C shares at the quotient value and purchased under a public offering at the subscription price plus a premium corresponding to the subscribers' financing costs, and then converted to Class B shares.
For all plans, additional shares have been allocated for financing of social security expenses. Treasury stock is sold on the Nasdaq Stockholm to cover social security payments when arising due to matching of shares. During 2016, 1,706,600 shares were sold at an average price of SEK 61.31. Sales of shares are recognized directly in equity.
If, as of December 31, 2016, all shares allocated for future matching under the Stock Purchase Plan were transferred, and shares designated to cover social security payments were disposed of as a result of the exercise and the matching, approximately 64 million Class B shares would be transferred, corresponding to 2.0% of the total number of shares outstanding, or 3,269 million not including treasury stock. As of December 31, 2016, 62 million Class B shares were held as treasury stock.

The table above shows how shares (representing matching rights but excluding shares for social security expenses) are being used for all outstanding plans. From up to down the table includes (A) the number of shares originally approved by the Annual General Meeting; (B) the number of originally designated shares that were outstanding at the beginning of 2016; (C) the number of shares awarded during 2016; (D) the number of shares matched during 2016; (E) the number of shares forfeited by participants or expired under the plan rules during 2016; and (F) the balance left as outstanding at the end of 2016, having added new awards to the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year and deducted the shares related to awards matched, forfeited and expired. The final row (G) shows the compensation costs charged to the accounts during 2016 for each plan, calculated as fair value in SEK.
For a description of compensation cost, including accounting treatment, see Note C1, "Significant accounting policies," section Sharebased compensation to employees and the Board of Directors.

FINANCIALS ­ Notes to the Parent Company financial statements
notes to the Parent Company F INANCIAL STATEMENTS

P1  Significant accounting policies
The financial statements of the Parent Company, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2 "Reporting in separate financial statements." RFR 2 requires the Parent Company to use the same accounting principles as for the Group, i.e., IFRS, to the extent allowed by RFR 2.
The main deviations between accounting policies adopted for the Group and accounting policies for the Parent Company are:
Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures The investments are accounted for according to the acquisition cost method. Investments are carried at cost and only dividends are accounted for in the income statement. An impairment test is performed annually and write-downs are made when permanent decline in value is established.
Contributions to/from subsidiaries and shareholders' contributions are accounted for according to RFR 2. Contributions from/to Swedish subsidiaries are reported net in the income statement. Shareholders' c ontributions increase the Parent Company's investments.
Classification and measurement of financial instruments IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is adopted, except regarding financial guarantees where the exception allowed in RFR 2 is chosen. Financial guarantees are included in Contingent liabilities.
Deferred taxes The accounting of untaxed reserves in the balance sheet results in different accounting of deferred taxes as compared to the principles applied in the consolidated statements. Swedish GAAP and tax regulations require a company to report certain differences between the tax basis and book value as an untaxed reserve in the balance sheet of the standalone financial statements. Changes to these reserves are reported as an addition to, or withdrawal from, untaxed reserves in the income statement.
Pensions Pensions are accounted for in accordance with the recommendation FAR SRS RedR 4 "Accounting for pension liability and pension cost" from the Institute for the Accountancy Profession in Sweden. According to RFR 2, IAS 19R shall be adopted regarding supplementary disclosures when applicable.
Business combinations Transaction costs attributable to the acquisition are included in the cost of acquisition in the Parent Company statements compared to Group Statements where these costs are expensed as incurred.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments See Notes to the consolidated financial statements ­ Note C2, "Critical accounting estimates and judgments." Major critical accounting estimates and judgments applicable to the Parent Company include "Trade and customer finance receivables" and "Acquired intellectual property rights and other intangible assets, excluding goodwill."

To secure long-term funding, the Parent Company uses notes and bond programs together with bilateral research and development loans. All outstanding notes and bond loans are issued by the Parent Company under its Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) program or under its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registered program. Bonds issued at a fixed interest rate are normally swapped to a floating interest rate using interest rate swaps leaving a maximum of 50% of outstanding loans at fixed interest rates. Total weighted average interest rate cost for the longterm funding during the year was 2.76% (2.58%). The outstanding EUR bond is revalued based on changes in benchmark interest rates according to the fair value hedge methodology stipulated in IAS 39.
In June 2016, the Company exercised its first extension option underthe USD 2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, extending thematurity date to June 2021. One extension option of one year remains.In November 2016, the Company signed a new EUR 0.5 billion termloan facility. The new facility has a tenor of two years with one extension option of one year and the facility serves for general corporate purposes.

In October 2016, Moody's announced that they have downgraded the senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa2 from Baa1 and the MTN program rating to Baa2 from Baa1. At the same time, the agency placed the company's Baa2/Baa2 ratings on review for further downgrade. In December 2016, Moody's concluded their review and announced that they havedowngraded the senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa3 from Baa2 and the MTN program rating to Baa3 from Baa2, with a negative outlook. In October 2016, S&P announced that they have downgraded the long-term corporate credit rating on Ericsson to BBB from BBB+, with a negative outlook.

Fair valuation of the Company's financial instruments The Company's financial instruments generally meet the requirements of level 1 valuation due to the fact that they are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Exceptions to this relates to: >> OTC derivatives with an amount of gross SEK 1.9 (2.8) billion in relation
to assets and gross SEK 1.2 (2.7) billion in relation to liabilities were valued based on references to other market data as currency or interest rates. These valuations fall under level 2 valuation as defined by IFRS. >> Ownership in other companies and other financial investments where the Company neither has control nor significant influence. The amount recognized in these cases was SEK 1.9 (1.9) billion. These assets, classified as level 3 assets for valuation purposes, have been valued based on value in use technique.

discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material

flow, liquidity, credit rating, market share, reputation, brand

and/or our share price. Additional risks and uncertainties

not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be

immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business.

Furthermore, our operating results may have a greater

v ariability than in the past and we may have difficulties

in accurately predicting future developments. See also

"Forward-Looking Statements."

Market, Technology and Business Risks
Challenging global economic conditions and political unrest and uncertainty as well as geopolitical risks may adversely impact the demand and pricing for our products and services as well as limit our ability to grow. Challenging global economic conditions and political unrest anduncertainty as well as geopolitical risk could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and for the products of our customers. Adverse global economic conditions and political unrest and uncertainty as well as geopolitical risk could cause operators and other customers to postpone investments or initiate other cost-cutting initiatives to improve their financial position. This could result in significantly reduced expenditures for our products and services, including network infrastructure, in which case our operating results would suffer. If demand for our products and services were to fall in the future, we could experience material adverse effects on our revenues, cash flow, capital employed and value of our assets and we could incur operating losses. Furthermore, if demand is significantly weaker or more volatile than expected, our credit rating, borrowing opportunities and costs as well as the trading price of our shares could be adversely impacted. Should global economic conditions fail to improve or worsen or should political unrest and uncertainty or geopolitical problems fail to, improve, or worsen, other business risks we face could intensify and could also negatively impact the business prospects of operators and other customers. Some operators and other customers, in particular in markets with weak currencies, may incur borrowing difficulties and slower traffic development, which may negatively affect their investment plans and cause them to purchase less of our products and services. The potential adverse effects of an economic downturn include: >> Reduced demand for products and services, resulting in
increased price competition or deferrals of purchases, with lower revenues not fully compensated through reduced costs >> Risks of excess and obsolete inventories and excess manu facturing capacity

>> Risk of financial difficulties or failures among our suppliers >> Increased demand for customer finance, difficulties in collec-
tion of accounts receivable and increased risk of counter party failures >> Risk of impairment losses related to our intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of certain products >> Increased difficulties in forecasting sales and financial results as well as increased volatility in our reported results >> Changes in the value in our pension plan assets resulting from for example, adverse equity and credit market developments and/or increased pension liabilities resulting from, for example, lower discount rates. Such development may trigger additional pension trust capitalization needs affecting the company's cash balance negatively >> End user demand could also be adversely affected by reduced consumer spending on technology, changed operator pricing, security breaches and trust issues. >> On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit". As a result of the referendum it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the UK´s withdrawal from the European Union. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to European markets either during a transitional period or permanently as well as on the agreements the UK makes with other trading partners. Any of the potential effects of Brexit could have unpredictable consequences for credit markets and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial performance. >> The recent change in political leadership in the U.S. has led to uncertainty about the U.S.' position in a number of areas such as foreign policy, international trade, customs and taxation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial performance.

FINANCIALS ­ Risk factors

We may not be successful in implementing our strategy or in achieving improvements in our earnings or in estimating addressable markets or market CAGR in the markets where we operate. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our strategy to achieve future earnings, growth or create shareholder value. When deemed necessary, we undertake specific restructuring or cost-saving initiatives; however, there are no guarantees that such initiatives will be sufficient, successful or executed in time to deliver any improvements in our earnings. Furthermore, this annual report includes certain estimates with respect to addressable markets as well as with respect to CAGR in the markets in which we operate, including the Networks, IT & Cloud, Media, and Industry and Society business. If the underlying assumptions on which our estimates are based prove not to be accurate, the actual addressable markets and CAGR may be materially different from the estimates presented in this annual report.
The telecommunications industry fluctuates and is affected by many factors, including the economic environment, and deci sions made by operators and other customers regarding their deployment of technology and their timing of purchases. The telecommunications industry has experienced downturns in the past in which operators substantially reduced their capital spending on new equipment. While we expect the network service provider equipment market, telecommunications services market and ICT market to grow in the coming years, the uncertainty surrounding the global economic recovery and the geopolitical situation may materially harm actual market conditions. Moreover, market conditions are subject to substantial fluctuation, and could vary geographically and across technologies. Even if global conditions improve, conditions in the specific industry segments in which we participate may be weaker than in other segments. In that case, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
If capital expenditures by operators and other customers are weaker than we anticipate, our revenues, operating results and profitability may be adversely affected. The level of demand from operators and other customers who buy our products and services can change quickly and can vary over short periods of time, including from month to month. Due to the uncertainty and variations in the telecommunication industry, as well as in the ICT industry, accurately forecasting revenues, results, and cash flow remains difficult.
Sales volumes and gross margin levels are affected by the mix and order time of our products and services. Our sales to operators and other customers represent a mix of equipment, software and services, which normally generate d ifferent gross margins. We sell our own products as well as thirdparty products, which normally have lower margins than our own products. As a consequence, our reported gross margin in a s pecific period will be affected by the overall mix of products and services as well as the relative content of third-party products. In the areas IT & Cloud, Media and Industry and Society, third-party products and services represent a larger portion of our business than our traditional sales, which challenge our business models including our terms and conditions. Further, network expansions and upgrades have much shorter lead times for delivery than initial network build outs. Orders for such network expansions and upgrades are normally placed at short notice by customers, often less than a month in advance, and consequently variations in demand are difficult to forecast. As a result, changes in our prod-

uct and service mix and the short order time for certain of our products may affect our ability to accurately forecast sales and margins or detect in advance whether actual results will deviate from market consensus. Short-term variation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
We may not be able to properly respond to market trends in the industries in which we operate, including the convergence of IT and telecom. We are affected by market conditions and trends within the industries in which we operate, including the convergence of the IT and telecom industries. Technological developments largely drive c onvergences enabling digitalization and a move from dedicated hardware to software and cloud based services. This is changing the competitive landscape as well as value chains and business models and affects our objective-setting, risk assessment and strategies. The change lowers entry barriers to the market and competitors new to our business have entered and may continue to enter the market and negatively impact our market share in selected areas. If we fail to understand the market development, or fail to acquire the necessary competencies to develop and sell products, services and solutions that are competitive in this changing business environment, our business, operating results and financial condition will suffer.
Our business depends upon the continued growth of mobile communications and the success of our existing customer base, the telecom operators. If growth slows or if our customers do not manage to maintain or grow relevance in the emerging digital value chain or if our products and/or services are not successful , our customers´ investment in networks may slow or stop, harming our business and operating results. A substantial portion of our business depends on the continued growth of mobile communications in terms of both the number of subscriptions and usage per subscriber, which in turn drives the continued deployment and expansion of network systems by our customers. If operators fail to increase the number of subscribers and/or usage does not increase, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Also, if operators fail to mon etize services, fail to adapt their business models or experience a decline in operator revenues or profitability, their willingness to further invest in their networks may decrease which will reduce their demand for our products and services and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Traffic development on cellular network could be affected if more traffic is offloaded to WI-FI-networks. Further alternative services provided over the internet have profound effects on operator voice/SMS revenues with possible reduced capital expenses consequences. Our value system is depending on the development and success of global standards. This could be affected adversely in the future by industry forces more interested in de-facto standards and or geo-political forces leading to standards fragment ation and increased difficulties of creating economies of scale.
Fixed and mobile networks converge and new technologies, such as IP and broadband, enable operators to deliver services in both fixed and mobile networks. We are dependent of the uptake of such services and the outcome of regulatory and standardization activities such as spectrum allocation. If delays in uptake, standardization or regulation occur, this could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We face intense competition from our existing competitors as well as new entrants, including IT companies entering the telecommunications market, and this could materially adversely affect our results. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of price, functionality, service quality, customization, timing of development, and the introduction of new products and services. We face intense competition from significant competitors, many of which are very large, with substantial technological and financial resources and established relationships with operators. We also encounter increased competition from new market entrants and alternative technologies are evolving industry standards. In particular, we face competition from large IT companies and web scale companies entering the telecommunications market who benefit from economies of scale due to being active in several industries. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Our competitors may implement new technologies before we do, offer more attractively priced or enhanced products, services or solutions, or they may offer other incentives that we do not provide. Some of our competitors may also have greater resources in certain business segments or geographic markets than we do. Increased competition could result in reduced profit margins, loss of market share, increased research and development costs as well as increased sales and marketing expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and market share.
Additionally, we operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and also the nature in which this technology is being brought to market is rapidly changing e.g. through opensource projects. This results in continuous price erosion and increased price competition for our products and services. If our counter measures, including enhanced products and business models or cost reductions cannot be achieved or do not occur in a timely manner, there could be adverse impacts on our business, operating results, financial condition and market share.
Vendor consolidation may lead to stronger competitors who are able to benefit from integration, scale and greater resources. Industry convergence and consolidation among equipment and services suppliers could potentially result in stronger competitors that are competing as end-to-end suppliers as well as competitors more specialized in particular areas, which could for example impact our areas such as IT & Cloud, Media and Industry and Society. Consolidation may also result in competitors with greater resources than we have or in reduction of our current scale advantages. This could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and market share.
A significant portion of our revenue is currently generated from a limited number of key customers, and operator consolidation may increase our dependence on key customers. We also are significantly dependent on the sales of certain of our products and services both in core business and targeted areas. We derive most of our business from large, multi-year agreements with a limited number of significant customers. Many of these agreements are opened up on a yearly basis to renegotiate the price for our products and services and do not contain committed purchase volumes. Although no single customer represented

more than 7% of our sales in 2016, our ten largest customers accounted for 46% of our sales in 2016. A loss of or a reduced role with a key customer could have a significant adverse impact on sales, profit and market share for an extended period. In addition, our dependence on the sales of certain of our products and services in both core business and targeted areas may have significant adverse impact on sales, profit and market share.
In recent years, network operators have undergone significant consolidation, resulting in fewer operators with activities in several countries. This trend is expected to continue, and intra-country consolidation is likely to accelerate as a result of competitive pressure. A market with fewer and larger operators will increase our reliance on key customers and may negatively impact our bargaining position and profit margins. Moreover, if the combined companies operate in the same geographic market, networks may be shared and less network equipment and fewer associated services may be required. Network investments could be delayed by the consolidation process, which may include, among others, actions relating to merger or acquisition agreements, securing necessary regulatory approvals, or integration of businesses. Network operators also share parts of their network infrastructure through cooperation agreements rather than legal consolidations, which may adversely affect demand for network equipment. Accordingly, operator consolidation may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, market share and financial condition.
Certain long-term agreements with customers still include commitments to future price reductions, requiring us to c onstantly manage and control our cost base. Long-term agreements with our customers are typically awarded on a competitive bidding basis. In some cases, such agreements also include a commitment to future price reductions. In order to maintain our gross margin with such price reductions, we continuously strive to reduce the costs of our products through design improvements, negotiation of better purchase prices from our suppliers, allocation of more production to low-cost countries and increased productivity in our own production. However, there can be no assurance that our actions to reduce costs will be sufficient or quick enough to maintain our gross margin in such contracts, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Growth of our managed services business is difficult to p redict, and requires taking significant contractual risks. Operators increasingly outsource parts of their operations to reduce cost and focus on new services. To address this oppor tunity, we offer operators various services in which we manage their networks. The growth rate in the managed services market is difficult to forecast and each new contract carries a risk that transformation and integration of the operations will not be as fast or smooth as planned. Additionally, early contract margins are generally low and the mix of new and old contracts may negatively affect reported results in a given period. Contracts for such services normally cover several years and generate recurring revenues. However, such contracts have been, and may in the future be, terminated or reduced in scope, which has negative impacts on sales and earnings. While we believe we have a strong position in the managed services market, competition in this area is increasing, which may have adverse effects on our future growth, business, operating results and profitability.

We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products, and the success of our substantial research and development investments is uncertain. Rapid technological and market changes in our industry require us to make significant investments in technological innovation. We invest significantly in new technology, products and solutions. In order for us to be successful, those technologies, products and solutions must be accepted by relevant standardization bodies and by the industry as a whole. The failure of our research and development efforts to be technically or commercially successful could have adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition. If we invest in the development of technologies, products and solutions that do not function as expected, are not adopted by the industry, are not ready in time, or are not successful in the marketplace, our sales and earnings may materially suffer. Additionally, it is common for research and development projects to encounter delays due to unforeseen problems. Delays in production and research and development may increase the cost of research and development efforts and put us at a disadvantage against our competition. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.
We engage in acquisitions and divestments which may be disruptive and require us to incur significant expenses. In addition to in-house innovation efforts, we make strategic acquisitions in order to obtain various benefits such as reduced time-to-market, access to technology and competence, increased scale or to broaden our product portfolio or customer base. Future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, financial c ondition and liquidity. Risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include: >> Difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies,
products and personnel of the acquired company >> Risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior
experience >> Potential loss of employees >> Diversion of management's attention away from other
business concerns >> Expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the
acquired company >> Difficulties in identifying attractive available targets.
From time to time we also divest parts of our business to optimize our product portfolio or operations. Any decision to dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges, such as workforce reduction costs and industry- and technology-related write-offs. We cannot assure that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or divestments on favorable terms or at all. The risks associated with such acquisitions and divestments could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
We are in, and may enter into new, JV arrangements and have, and may have new, partnerships, which may not be successful and expose us to future costs. Our JV and partnership arrangements, including for example our partnership with Cisco, may fail to perform as expected for various reasons, including an incorrect assessment of our needs and syn-

ergies, our inability to take action without the approval of our partners, our difficulties in implementing our business plans, the lack of capabilities or financial instability of our strategic partners. Our ability to work with these partners or develop new products and solutions may become constrained, which could harm our competitive position in the market.
Additionally, our share of any losses from or commitments to contribute additional capital to such JVs and partnerships may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers of components, p roduction capacity and R&D and IT services, which exposes us to supply disruptions and cost increases. Our ability to deliver according to market demands and contractual commitments depends significantly on obtaining a timely and adequate supply of materials, components, production capacity and other vital services on competitive terms. Although we strive to avoid single-source supplier solutions, this is not always possible. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will be unable to obtain key supplies we need to produce our products and provide our services on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Failure by any of our suppliers could interrupt our product or services supply or operations and significantly limit sales or increase our costs. To find an alternative supplier or redesign products to replace components may take significant time which could cause significant delays or interruptions in the delivery of our products and services. We have from time to time experienced interruptions of supply and we may experience such interruptions in the future.
Furthermore, our procurement of supplies requires us to predict future customer demands. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an over or under supply of components and production capacity could occur. In many cases, some of our competitors utilize the same manufacturers and if they have purchased capacity ahead of us we could be blocked from acquiring the needed products. This factor could limit our ability to supply our customers and increase costs. At the same time, we commit to certain capacity levels or component quantities, which, if unused, will result in charges for unused capacity or scrapping costs. We are also exposed to financial counterpart risks to suppliers when we pay in advance for supplies. Such supply disruptions and cost increases may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Product or service quality issues could lead to reduced r evenue and gross margins and declining sales to existing and new customers. Sales contracts normally include warranty undertakings for faulty products and often include provisions regarding penalties and/or termination rights in the event of a failure to deliver ordered products or services on time or with required quality. Although we undertake a number of quality assurance measures to reduce such risks, product quality or service performance issues may negatively affect our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues, our operating results and financial p osition could be negatively impacted by costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects, high service and warranty expenses, high inventory obsolescence expense, delays in c ollecting accounts receivable or declining sales to existing and new customers.

Due to having a significant portion of our costs in SEK and revenues in other currencies, our business is exposed to f oreign exchange fluctuations that could negatively impact our revenues and operating results. We incur a significant portion of our expenses in SEK. As a result of our international operations, we generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenue in currencies other than SEK. To the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our consolidated income statement, balance sheet and cash flows when foreign currencies are exchanged or translated to SEK, which increases volatility in reported results.
As market prices are predominantly established in US dollars or Euros, we presently have a net revenue exposure in foreign curren cies which means that a stronger SEK exchange rate would generally have a negative effect on our reported results. Our attempts to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations through a variety of hedging activities may not be sufficient or successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our results and financial condition.
Our ability to benefit from intellectual property rights (IPR), which are critical to our business, may be limited by changes in regulation relating to patents, inability to prevent infringement, the loss of licenses to or from third-parties, infringement claims brought against us by competitors and others and changes in the area of open standards, especially in light of recent attention on licensing of open standard essential patents. Although we have a large number of patents, there can be no assurance that they will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any rights granted in relation to our patents will in fact provide us with competitive advantages.
We utilize a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality p olicies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements in addition to relying on patent, copyright and trademark laws to p rotect our intellectual property rights. However, these measures may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation. In addition, we rely on many software patents, and limitations on the patentability of software may materially affect our business.
Moreover, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to establish and enforce our proprietary rights. In fact, existing legal systems of some countries in which we conduct business offer only limited protection of intellectual property rights, if at all. Our solutions may also require us to license technologies from third-parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses and there can be no assurance that they will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third-parties on a non-exclusive basis could limit our ability to protect proprietary rights in our products.
Many key aspects of telecommunications and data network technology are governed by industry-wide standards usable by all market participants. As the number of market entrants and the complexity of technology increases, the possibility of functional overlap and inadvertent infringement of intellectual property rights also increases. In addition to industry-wide standards, other key industry-wide software solutions are today developed by market participants as free and open source software. Contributing to the development and distribution of software developed as free and open source software may limit our ability to enforce applic able patents in the future. Third-parties have asserted, and may

assert in the future, claims, directly against us or against our customers, alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Defending such claims may be expensive, time-consuming and divert the efforts of our management and/or technical personnel. As a result of litigation, we could be required to pay damages and other compensation directly or to indemnify our customers for such damages and other compensation, develop non-infringing products/technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. How ever, we cannot be certain that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and such judgments could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. Using free and open source software may allow third-parties to further investigate our software due to the accessibility of source code. This may in turn make this software more prone to assertions from third-parties.
Recent attention on licensing of patents necessary to conduct an open standard (e.g. 2G, 3G and 4G technology), investigations held by antitrust authorities, court judgments and legislative change could potentially affect Ericsson's ability to benefit from its patent portfolio in the area of such open standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. Ericsson holds a leading patent portfolio in open standards and possible changes regarding such a portfolio may materially affect our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.
We are involved in lawsuits and investigations which, if determined against us, could require us to pay substantial damages, fines and/or penalties. In the normal course of our business we are involved in legal proceedings. These lawsuits include such matters as commercial disputes, claims regarding intellectual property, antitrust, tax and labor disputes. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation.
As a publicly listed company, Ericsson may be exposed to lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that the Company or its officers have failed to comply with securities laws, stock market regulations or other laws, regulations or requirements. Whether or not there is merit to such claims, the time and costs incurred to defend the Company and its officers and the potential settlement or com pensation to the plaintiffs could have significant impact on our reported results and reputation. For additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved, see "Legal Proceedings" in the Board of Directors' Report.
Our operations are complex and several critical operations are centralized in a single location. Any disruption of our operations, whether due to natural or man-made events, may be highly damaging to the operation of our business. Our business operations rely on complex operations and communications networks, which are vulnerable to damage or disturb ance from a variety of sources. Having outsourced significant portions of our operations, such as IT, finance and HR operations, we depend on the performance of external companies, including their security and reliability measures. Regardless of protection measures, systems and communications networks are susceptible to disruption due to failure, vandalism, computer viruses, security or privacy breaches, natural disasters, power outages and other events. We also have a concentration of operations on

Financials ­ Risk factors

FINANCIALS ­ Risk factors

certain sites, including R&D, production, network operation centers, ICT centers and logistic centers and shared services centers, where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs. The delivery of goods from suppliers, and to customers, could also be hampered for the reasons stated above. Interruptions to our systems and communications may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
Cyber security incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation and brand. Ericsson's business operations involve areas that are particularly vulnerable to cyber security incidents that may impact confidentiality, availability or integrity of products, services, or solutions. These incidents may include data breaches, intrusions, espionage, know-how and data privacy infringements, leakage, unauthorized or accidental modification of data and general malfeasance. Examples of these areas include, among others, research and development, managed services, usage of cloud solutions, software development, lawful interception, product engineering, IT, finance and HR operations. Any cyber security incident including unintended use, involving our operations, product development, services, our third-party providers or installed product base, could cause severe harm to Ericsson and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation and brand.
Ericsson relies heavily on third-parties to whom we have outsourced significant aspects of our IT infrastructure, product development, engineering services, finance and HR operations. While we have taken precautions relating to the selection, integration and ongoing management of these third-parties, any event or incident that is caused as a result of vulnerabilities in their operations or products supplied to us could have a material adverse effect upon Ericsson, our business, financial condition, reputation and brand, potentially slowing operations, leaking valuable intellectual property or sensitive information or damaging our products which have been installed in our customers' networks.
We must continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees to remain competitive. We believe that our future success largely depends on our cont inued ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain engineers and other qualified personnel needed to develop successful new products, support our existing product range and provide services to our customers.
Competition for skilled personnel and highly qualified managers in the industries in which we operate remains intense. We are continuously developing our corporate culture, remuneration, promotion and benefits policies as well as other measures aimed at empowering our employees and reducing employee turnover. However, there are no guarantees that we will be successful in attracting and retaining employees with appropriate skills in the future, and failure in retention and recruiting could have a material adverse effect on our business and brand.
If our customers' financial conditions decline, we will be exposed to increased credit and commercial risks. After completing sales to customers, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivables and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectable accounts receivable. We regularly assess the credit worthiness of our customers and based on that assessment we determine a credit limit for each one of them. Challenging economic conditions have impacted some of our customers' ability to pay their invoices. Although our credit losses

have historically been low and we have policies and procedures for managing customer finance credit risk, we may be unable to avoid future losses on our trade receivables. We have also experienced demands for customer financing, and in adverse financial markets or more competitive environments, those demands may increase. Upon the financial failure of a customer, we may experience losses on credit extended and loans made to such customer, losses relating to our commercial risk exposure, and the loss of the customer's ongoing business. If customers fail to meet their obligations to us, we may experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of reserves, which could materially adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.
We rely on various sources for short-term and long-term capital for the funding of our business. Should such capital become unavailable or available in insufficient amounts or unreasonable terms, our business, financial condition and cash flow may materially suffer. Our business requires a significant amount of cash. If we do not generate sufficient amounts of capital to support our operations, service our debt and continue our research and development and customer finance programs, or if we cannot raise sufficient amounts of capital at the required times and on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and cash flow are likely to be adversely affected. Access to funding may decrease or become more expensive as a result of our operational and financial con dition, market conditions, including financial conditions in the Eurozone, or due to deterioration in our credit rating. There can be no assurance that additional sources of funds that we may need from time to time will be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot access capital on a commercially viable basis, our business, financial condition and cash flow could materially suffer.
Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. An impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could adver sely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets; for example, patents, customer relations, trademarks and software.
Goodwill is the only intangible asset the company has recognized to have indefinite useful life. Other intangible assets are mainly amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated u seful lives, but for no more than ten years, and are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuances, product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Those not yet in use are tested for impairment annually.
Historically, we have recognized impairment charges related to intangible assets mainly due to restructuring. Additional impairment charges may be incurred in the future that could be significant due to various reasons, including restructuring actions or adverse market conditions that are either specific to us or the broader telecommunications industry or more general in nature and that could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Negative deviations in actual cash flows compared to estimated cash flows as well as new estimates that indicate lower future cash flows might result in recognition of impairment charges. Estimates require management judgment as well as the definition of cash-generating units for impairment testing purposes. Other judgments might result in significantly different results and may differ from the actual financial condition in the future.

Regulatory, Compliance and Corporate G overnance risk
Ericsson may fail or be unable to comply with laws or regul ations and could experience penalties and adverse rulings in enforcement or other proceedings. Compliance with changed laws or regulations may subject Ericsson to increased costs or reduced products and services demand. Compliance failure as well as required operational changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, f inancial condition and brand. The industries in which we operate are subject to laws and regu lations. While Ericsson strives for compliance, we cannot assure that violations do not occur. If we fail to or are unable to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could experience pen alties and adverse rulings in enforcement or other proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation.
Further changes in laws or regulations could subject us to liability, increased costs, or reduced products and services demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and brand.
Changes to regulations may adversely affect both our customers' and our own operations. For example, regulations imposing more stringent, time-consuming or costly planning and zoning requirements or building approvals for radio base stations and other network infrastructure could adversely affect the timing and costs of network construction or expansion, and ultimately the commercial launch and success of these networks. Similarly, tariff and roaming regulations or rules on network neutrality could also affect operators' ability or willingness to invest in network infrastructure, which in turn could affect the sales of our systems and services. Additionally, delay in radio frequency spectrum allocation, and allocation between different types of usage may adversely affect operator spending or force us to develop new products to be able to compete.
Further, we develop many of our products and services based on existing regulations and technical standards. Changes to existing regulations and technical standards, or the implementation of new regulations and technical standards relating to products and services not previously regulated, could adversely affect our development efforts by increasing compliance costs and causing delay. Demand for those products and services could also decline. Regulatory changes in license fees, environmental, health and safety, privacy (including the cross-border transfer of personal data for example between the EU and the US), and other regulatory areas may increase costs and restrict our operations or the operations of network operators and service providers. Also indirect impacts of such changes and regulatory changes in other fields, such as pricing regulations, could have an adverse impact on our business even though the specific regulations may not apply directly to our products or us.

Our substantial international operations are subject to u ncertainties which could affect our operating results. We conduct business throughout the world and are subject to the effects of general global economic conditions as well as conditions unique to specific countries or regions. We have customers in more than 180 countries, with a significant proportion of our sales to emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Our extensive operations are subject to additional risks, including civil disturbances, acts of terrorism, economic and geopolitical instability and conflict, potential misuse of technology leading to human rights violations, pandemics, the imposition of exchange controls, economies which are subject to significant fluctuations, nationalization of private assets or other governmental actions affecting the flow of goods and currency, effects from changing climate and difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through local legal systems. Further, in certain markets in which we operate, there is a risk of protectionist governmental measures implemented to assist domestic market participants at the expense of foreign competitors. The implementation of such measures could adversely affect our sales or our ability to purchase critical components.
We must always comply with relevant export control regulations and sanctions or other trade embargoes in force in all parts of the business process. The political situation in parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East, remains uncertain and the level of sanctions is still high. A universal element of these sanctions are the financial restrictions with respect to individuals and/or legal entities, but sanctions can also restrict certain exports and ultimately lead to a complete trade embargo towards a country. Specifically, on Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ("JCPOA") agreement between Iran and other countries have relaxed many of the nuclear related sanctions towards Iran, particularly the EU sanctions. Although many sanctions against Iran have already been relaxed, there are provisions to re-introduce sanctions if parts of the agreement are not met. The change in political leadership in the U.S. has also led to uncertainty about their position in foreign policy, including sanctions towards Iran and other sanctioned countries. Further there is a risk in many countries of unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, price or exchange controls, or other governmental policies which could limit our operations and decrease our profitability. Further export control regulations, sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions put upon countries in which we are active may result in a reduction of commitment in those countries. The need to terminate activities as a result of further trade restrictions may also expose us to customer claims and other actions. Although we seek to comply with all such regulations, there can be no assurance that we are or will be compliant with all relevant regulations at all times. Such potential violations could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results, reputation and brand.

The business operations are complex involving the development, production and delivery of telecom solutions to customers in a very large number of jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction has its own tax legislation and regulations and we therefore face the challenge of complying with the relevant rules in each of these countries. These rules involve income taxes and indirect taxes such as VAT and sales taxes as well as withholding taxes on domestic and cross border payments and social security charges related to our employees. Constant changes of the rules and the interpretation of the legislation also create exposures regarding taxes. This results in complex tax issues and tax disputes that may lead to additional tax payment obligations. Being a global operation, we also face risk of being taxed for the same income in more than one jurisdiction (double taxation). This could have adverse effects on our operating results, reputation and brand.
In certain regional markets, there are trade barriers that limit competition. Should these trade barriers be removed or lowered, competition may increase, which could have material adverse effects on our business and operating results.
There has been a concern reported by some media and others, that certain countries may use features of their telecommunications systems in ways that could result in potential violation of human rights. This may adversely affect the telecommunications business and may have a negative impact for people, our reputation and brand.
We may fail to comply with our corporate governance standards, which could negatively affect our business, o perating results, financial condition, reputation and brand. We are subject to corporate governance laws and regulations as well as several corporate responsibility and sustainability requirements. In some of the countries where we operate, corruption risks are high, therefore there is a higher focus on anticorruption, for example with changed legislation in many countries. To ensure that our operations are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and requirements, our management system includes a Code of Business Ethics, a Code of Conduct and a Sustainability Policy, as well as other policies and directives to govern our processes and operations. Our commitment to apply the UN Global Compact ten principles, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and principles of the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative to our operations cannot fully prevent unintended or unlawful use of our technology by democratic and non-democratic regimes, violation of our Code of Business Ethics, corruption or violations of our Code of Conduct in the supply chain. There is also an increased demand from external stakeholders, for example non-governmental organizations and investors, on transparency about sustainability and corporate responsibility issues that might be difficult to fulfill. Ericsson is voluntarily cooperating with inquiries from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice regard-

ing its compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These inquiries concern the last ten years. While Ericsson is fully cooperating with the U.S. authorities to answer these and additional questions, the outcome of these questions is currently not determinable. While we attempt to monitor and audit internally and externally our compliance with the policies and directives as well as our suppliers' adherence to our Code of Conduct and strive for continuous improvements, we cannot provide any assurances that violations will not occur which could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition, reputation, and brand.
Failure to comply with environmental, health and safety r egulations in many jurisdictions may expose us to s ignificant penalties and other sanctions. We are subject to certain environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that affect our operations, facilities, products and services in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we work actively to ensure compliance with material laws, regulations and customer requirements related to the environment, health, and safety that apply to us, we can provide no assurance that we have been, are, or will be compliant with these laws, regulations and requirements. If we have failed or fail to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements we could be subject to significant penalties and other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial con dition, reputation and brand. Additionally, there is a risk that we may have to incur expenditures to cover environmental and health and safety-liabilities to maintain compliance with current or future applicable laws and regulations or to undertake any necessary remediation. It is difficult to reasonably estimate the future impact of environmental matters, such as climate change and extreme weather events, including potential liabilities. Adverse future events, regulations, or judgments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial cond ition, reputation and brand.
Potential health risks related to radiofrequency electro magnetic fields may subject us to various product liability claims and result in regulatory changes. The mobile telecommunications industry is subject to claims that mobile devices and other equipment that generate radiofrequency electromagnetic fields may expose users to health risks. At present, a substantial number of scientific reviews conducted by various independent research bodies have concluded that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, at levels within the limits prescribed by public health authority safety standards and recommendations, cause no adverse effects to human health. However, any perce ived risk or new scientific findings of adverse health effects from mobile communication devices and equipment could adversely affect us through a reduction in sales or through liability claims.

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Although Ericsson's products are designed to comply with c urrently applicable safety standards and regulations regarding radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, we cannot guarantee that we will not become the subject of product liability claims or be held liable for such claims or be required to comply with future changed regulatory requirements that may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, reputation and brand.
Regulations related to "conflict minerals" may cause us to incur additional expenses, and may make our supply chain more complex. In 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted a rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals ( "conflict minerals") that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by companies that file periodic reports with the SEC, whether or not these products or their components are manufactured by third- parties. While we believe that we are able to fulfill these requirements without materially affecting our costs or access to materials we can provide no assurance that there will not be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availa bility and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. In addition, since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals contained in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges if customers require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free.
Risks associated with owning Ericsson shares
Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile, especially as technology companies, securities and markets as a whole remain volatile. Our share price has been volatile due to various factors, including our operating performance as well as the high volatility in the securities markets generally and volatility in telecommunications and technology companies' securities in particular. Our share price is also likely to be affected by future developments in our market, our financial results and the expectations of financial analysts, as well as statements and market speculation regarding our prospects or the timing or content of any public communications, including reports of operating results, by us or our competitors.

Factors other than our financial results that may affect our share price include, but are not limited to: >> A weakening of our brand name or other circumstances with
adverse effects on our reputation >> Announcements by our customers, competitors or us regard-
ing capital spending plans of our customers >> Financial difficulties for our customers >> Awards of large supply or service contracts >> Speculation in the press or investment community about the
company and its operations or about the business level or growth in the telecommunications market >> Technical problems, in particular those relating to the introduction and viability of new network systems, including LTE evolution / 5G small cells products and new platforms such as the HDS 8000 ( Hyperscale Datacenter System) platform. >> Actual or expected results of ongoing or potential litigation >> Announcements concerning bankruptcy or investigations into the accounting procedures of ourselves or other telecommunications companies >> Our ability to forecast and communicate our future results in a manner consistent with investor expectation
Our corporate restructure may not produce the expected results Ericsson is undergoing a corporate restructure as well as a company transformation in an effort to drive efficiency and growth across the company. This includes changes to the business, management and a reduction in our workforce. These activities pose certain risks to our business and may not produce the expected results which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, brand and share price.
Currency fluctuations may adversely affect our share price or value of dividends. Because our shares are quoted in SEK on Nasdaq Stockholm (our primary stock exchange), but in US dollars on NASDAQ New York (ADSs), fluctuations in exchange rates between SEK and US dollars may affect our share price. In addition, because we pay cash dividends in SEK, fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the value of distributions when converted into other currencies. An increasing part of the trade in our shares is carried out on alternative exchanges or markets, which may lead to less accurate share price information on Nasdaq Stockholm or NASDAQ New York.

Auditor's report

To the Annual General Meeting of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Corporate Identity Number 556016-0680
Report on the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts

Opinion We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson for the year 2016. The company's annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 38-127 in this document.
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Parent Company as at 31 December 2016 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all

material respects, the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2016 and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
We, therefore, recommend that the annual meeting of shareholders adopt the income statement and balance sheet for the Parent Company and for the Group.

Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with

professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

Our audit approach Overview
>> Overall group materiality: SEK 800 million, which represents 5% of the average income before tax for the last four years adjusted for restructuring costs in 2016 which are covered by separate audit procedures.
>> The scope of our audit is based on our understanding of the risk areas in Ericsson, the signi ficance of these risks and how they are handled and controlled within the company. Consequently, the greatest weight is assigned to those risk areas deemed to be most important, where the risk of material misstatement is the most significant. In this assessment, consideration has also been given as to whether the preparation of the accounts has been dependent on management's estimates and subjective judgements.
>> Revenue recognition for major contracts >> Revenue recognition for license fees >> Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets >> Provisions

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Audit scope The Ericsson Group delivers integrated solutions for a wide range of customers primarily within the telecommunication industry. The solutions provided by Ericsson are normally a combination of hardware, software and services. The customer contracts are often of a complex nature with a number of performance criteria. Ericsson has also significant revenues from patent license agreements with other hardware and software suppliers. As a global player, Ericsson is impacted by the macro economic development and the customers response to this such as investment levels and access to financing of investments. The competition within the industry Ericsson operates is significant which in many markets have resulted in price pressure. As a result, Ericsson has initiated several activities to reduce the cost levels and to increase the flexibility in production.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.
The group conducts business in more than 180 countries and has centralized systems, procedures and a centralized financing function. We have organized the audit work by having our central team to carry out the testing of all centralized systems and procedures whereby the local auditors carry out additional testing based on our instructions. The 14 most important entities within the Group represent 71% of net sales and 73% of total assets. All of these entities were a part of our audit of the consolidated accounts.
Our audit is carried out continuously during the year with special attention at each quarter end. In connection with the issuance of the interim reports, we report our observations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and for the third and fourth quarters, we have also issued public review reports. At the end of the year, we also report our main observations to the full Board of Directors.

Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Overall group materiality How we determined it
Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied

SEK 800 million (SEK 800 million)
5% of the average income before tax for the last four years adjusted for restructuring costs in 2016 which are covered by separate audit procedures.
We choose the adjusted average income before tax as we consider this measure to be a key driver of business value for the stakeholders.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above SEK 80 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, w arranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the Key audit matter

Revenue recognition of major contracts
The application of revenue recognition accounting standards is complex and requires management judgement and estimates. Large and complex customer contracts are a major part of the business and many of these include multiple elements of products, software and services as well as complex contract terms. The organization of the Ericsson Group also results in that a customer contract often involves more than one legal entity within the group.  Refer to the Annual Report Note C2 ­ Critical accounting estimates and judgements.

Our audit included a combination of testing of internal controls over financial reporting including procedures relating to business case reviews performed by the Groups central board for complex deals, analytical procedures and detailed tests of major new contracts. Our audit also included detailed tests of proof of delivery to confirm that risk had been transferred to the customer as well as data analytics relating to revenue related manual journal entries.  Based on our work, we noted no significant issues regarding the accuracy of revenue reported for the year.

Revenue recognition of license fees
With more than 42 000 patents, license fees have a significant effect on the Groups income. Many license agreements include both up-front fees and fees relating to the number of units sold by the customer.  Refer to the Annual Report Note C2 ­ Critical accounting estimates and j udgements.

Our audit included a combination of testing of internal controls over financial reporting, assessment of the Groups accounting policy for license fees, analytical procedures and detailed tests of major new contracts.  Based on our work, we noted no significant issues regarding the accuracy of revenue reported for the year.

Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets are significant to the consolidated accounts and are sensitive to impairment. Under IFRS, these assets require annual impairment tests which require management judgment and estimates such as projected cash flows, future market conditions and discount rates. All of these are subject to judgement and subjectivity and might be affected by the current turbulence in the global economy.  Refer to the Annual Report Note C2 ­ Critical accounting estimates and judgements and Note C10 ­ Intangible assets.

Our audit included a combination of testing of controls over financial reporting, analytical procedures and detailed tests of management impairment tests. In our detailed testing, we have involved our valuation experts to challenge the assumptions and estimates made by management.  Based on our work, we noted that there is no indication of impairment of goodwill or other intangible except for one segment Media. A stress test has been performed and presented in Note C10- Intangible assets. The future cash flow is based on five years business plans for the new segments from 2017 Networks, IP & Cloud and Media and includes several key assumptions. Should the discount rate be increased from 8% to 10.0% the recoverable amount is equal to the carrying amount, SEK 7.4 bn for segment Media.

Provisions
The need for provisions are by nature based on judgement and management estimates of future outflow of cash. Ericsson has made provisions relating to customer projects, w arranty, litigations, restructuring and other contractual obligations.  Refer to the Annual Report Note C2 ­ Critical accounting estimates and judgements and Note C18 ­ Provisions.

Our audit included a combination of testing of controls over financial reporting, analytical procedures and detailed testing to ensure that provisions made are sufficient for existing commitments and exposures. In our detailed testing, we have also tested additions to and utilization of provisions made for restructuring to ensure correct c lassification. The Profitability Plus program has continued 2016 including significant reductions in Sweden resulting in restructuring costs of SEK 7.6 bn in 2016.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

Opinion In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have audited the administration of the Board of Directors and Managing Directors of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson for the year 2016 and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss.
We recommend to the annual general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Directors be discharged from liability for the financial year.
Basis for opinion We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company's profit or loss. At the proposal of a d ividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company's and the group's equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the company's organization and the administration of the company's affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company's and the group's financial situation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company's financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors' guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfil the company's accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.

Auditor's Responsibilities Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect: >> has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which
can give rise to liability to the company, or >> in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies
Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.
Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.
As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company's situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circum stances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors' proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors' reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 2016
Corporate governance describes how rights and responsibilities are distributed among corporate bodies according to applicable laws, rules and internal processes. Corporate governance also defines the decision-making systems and structure through which owners directly or indirectly control a company.

I believe that a robust corporate culture is fundamental to maintain credible, competitive and sustainable business operations worldwide. Having global operations implies challenges. Therefore, as Chairman of the Board, I must continuously work to keep good governance, leadership and talent management high on the agenda in the Board room as well as throughout the global operations. A robust corporate culture must be anchored in a strong commitment from the Board and from management who must clearly emphasize the importance of conducting business with integrity. Such commitment is fundamental to create and maintain a robust corporate culture throughout a global organization. 2016 has been a year of change for Ericsson with a new organization, many new members of the Executive Leadership Team and a new CEO appointed. In a professional executive recruitment process, evaluating both internal and external candidates, many important in depth considerations are made by the Board, for example in relation to the Group strategy, talent management and corporate culture, which is valuable for the Board. In times of change, stability in terms of corporate culture and core values becomes even more important.
The Board of Directors also has an important role to give Group management clear governance frameworks and mandates, and to set the Group strategy. I always strive to enable an open and meaningful dialogue, both within the Board and between the Board and the Group management. The management dialogue aims to give the Board relevant insights in the business activities of Ericsson and in the markets in which Ericsson operates. The Board also visits various parts of the Group's business operations as well as engages with customers, partners, academia and thought leaders in order to gain further insights. I believe that these insights are necessary for the Board to provide relevant support to management and add value, while also exercising due control of the business operations. Ericsson takes compliance concerns very seriously and the Company uses considerable resources to investigate alleged compliance concerns.
This Corporate Governance Report 2016 aims to describe how Ericsson continuously works with these matters and how we focus on establishing efficient and reliable controls and procedures. I believe that Ericsson's continuous corporate governance focus and work to create a robust corporate culture have an important role to build trust, and in turn generate value for our investors.

Proposals to the Nomination Committee Shareholders may submit proposals to the Nomination Committee at any time, but should do so in due time before the AGM to ensure that the proposals can be considered by the Committee. Further information is available on Ericsson's website.

The Annual General Meeting of shareholders has adopted an Instruction for the Nomination Committee that includes the tasks of the Nomination Committee and the procedures for appointing its members. The Instruction applies until the General Meeting of shareholders resolves otherwise. Under the Instruction, the Nomination Committee shall consist of: >> Representatives of the four largest sharehold-
ers by voting power by the end of the month in which the AGM was held, and >> The Chairman of the Board of Directors.
The Committee may also include additional members following a request by a shareholder. The request must be justified by changes in the shareholder's ownership of shares and be received by the Nomination Committee no later than December 31 of each year. No fees are paid to the members of the Nomination Committee.
Members of the Nomination Committee The current Nomination Committee members appointed in May 2016 are: >> Petra Hedengran (Investor AB), Chairman of
the Nomination Committee >> Bengt Kjell (AB Industrivärden, Svenska
Handelsbankens Pensionsstiftelse) >> Johan Held (AFA Försäkring) >> Anders Oscarsson (AMF ­ Försäkring och
Fonder) >> Leif Johansson, Chairman of the Board of
Directors
The tasks of the Nomination Committee The main task of the Committee is to propose Board members for election by the AGM. As member of the Nomination Committee, the Chairman of the Board of Directors fulfills an important role to inform the Committee of the Company's strategy and future challenges. Such insights are necessary for the Committee to be able to assess the competence and experience that is required by the Board. In addition, the Committee must consider independence rules applicable to the Board of Directors and its committees.
The Nomination Committee also makes the following proposals, for resolution by the AGM: >> Proposal for remuneration to non-employee
Directors elected by the AGM and remuneration to the auditor >> Proposal for election of auditor, whereby candidates are selected in cooperation with the Audit Committee of the Board >> Proposal for election of Chairman at the AGM >> Proposal of changes to the Instruction for the Nomination Committee (if any).

Work of the Nomination Committee for the AGM 2017 The Nomination Committee started its work by going through a checklist of its duties under the Code and the Instruction for the Nomination Committee and by setting a time plan for its work ahead. A good understanding of Ericsson's business and strategy is important for the members of the Nomination Committee. Therefore, the Chairman of the Board presented his views to the Committee members on the Company's position and strategy. During the fall of 2016, the Committee also met with Ericsson's President and CEO, Jan Frykhammar, who presented his views in this respect.
The Committee was thoroughly informed of the results of the evaluation of the Board work and procedures, including the performance of the Chairman of the Board. On this basis, the Committee has assessed the competence and experience required by Ericsson Board members. The Nomination Committee has applied the Swedish Corporate Governance Code, section 4.1, as diversity policy and has continuously assessed the need for improvement of the composition of the Board in terms of diversity in competence, experience, age, gender and cultural/geographic background. The Nomination Committee aims to propose a composition of Board members with complementing experiences and competencies to make it possible for the Board to contribute to a positive development of Ericsson. The Nomination Committee searches for potential Board member candidates both with a long-term and a short-term perspective and always focuses on diversity to ensure that the Board get different perspectives into the Board work and considerations. The Nomination Committee also considers the need for renewal and carefully assesses whether the proposed Directors have the capability to devote necessary time and care to the Board work.
In 2016, the Committee met with the Chairman of the Audit Committee to acquaint itself with the assessments made by the Company and the Audit Committee of the quality and efficiency of external auditor work. The Audit Committee also provided its recommendations on external auditor and audit fees.
As of February 24, 2017, the current Nomination Committee has held six meetings.

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Board of Directors

The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the organization of Ericsson and the management of Ericsson's operations. The Board app oints the President and CEO who is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations in accord ance with guidelines from the Board. The President and CEO ensures that the Board is updated regularly on issues of importance to Ericsson. This includes updates on business development, results, financial position and liquidity.
Directors serve from the close of one AGM to the close of the next, but can serve any number of consecutive terms.
The President and CEO may be elected a Director of the Board, but, under the Swedish Companies Act, the President of a public company may not be elected Chairman of the Board.
Conflicts of interest Ericsson maintains rules and regulations regarding conflicts of interest. Directors are disqualified from participating in any decision regarding agreements between themselves and Ericsson. The same applies to agreements between Ericsson and any third-party or legal entity in which the Board member has an interest that may be contrary to the interests of Ericsson.
The Audit Committee oversees the procedures for related-party transactions and has implemented a pre-approval process for non-audit services carried out by the external auditor.
Composition of the Board of Directors The current Board of Directors consists of nine Directors elected by the shareholders at the AGM 2016 for the period until the close of the AGM 2017. The former Director and President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, was also elected Director at the AGM 2016 but, on July 25, 2016, it was announced that he left his positions with Ericsson, including his Board position, effective immediately. The Board of Directors also consists of three employee representatives, each with a deputy, appointed by the trade unions for the same period of time.
Work procedure Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act, the Board of Directors has adopted a work procedure and Committee charters outlining rules for the distribution of tasks among the Board, its Committees and the President and CEO. This complements rules in the Swedish Companies Act and in the Articles of Association of the Company. The work procedure and the Committee charters are reviewed, evaluated and amended by the Board as required or appro priate, and are adopted by the Board at least once a year.

Independence The Board of Directors and its Committees are subject to a variety of independence rules under applicable Swedish law, the Code and appli cable US securities laws, SEC rules and the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. Ericsson can rely on exemptions from certain US and SEC requirements and may decide to follow Swedish practices in lieu of the NASDAQ Stock Market independence rules.
The composition of the Board of Directors meets all applicable independence criteria. The Nomination Committee concluded before the AGM 2016 that, for purposes of the Code, at least six of the nominated Directors were independent from Ericsson, its senior management and its major shareholders. These were Nora Denzel, Leif Johansson, Ulf J. Johansson, Kristin S. Rinne, Kristin Skogen Lund and Sukhinder Singh Cassidy.
Structure of the work of the Board of Directors The work of the Board follows a yearly cycle. This enables the Board to appropriately address each of its duties and to keep strategy, risk assessment and value creation high on the agenda. In addition to Board meetings, the annual work cycle of the Board includes two Board Strategic Days held in connection with Board meetings. The Board Strategic Days are described below under Training and Board Strategic Days.
As the Board is responsible for financial oversight, financial information is presented and evaluated at each Board meeting. Furthermore, the Chairman of each Committee, reports on Committee work at each Board meeting and minutes from Committee meetings are distributed to all Directors prior to the Board meetings.
At Board meetings, the President and CEO reports on business and market developments as well as on the financial performance of the Group. Strategic issues and risks are also addressed at most Board meetings. The Board is regularly informed of developments in legal and regulatory matters of importance. Board and Committee meetings may, as appropriate, be held by way of telephone or video conference, and resolutions may be taken per capsulam (unanimous written consent). Such resolutions are accounted for as Board/Committee meetings.

Bi-annual Board Strategic Days are arranged for Board members as part of ordinary Board meetings, normally spanning one full day each. The Board Strategic Days focus on combining strategy issues with making deep dives into issues of importance for the Ericsson Group. The purpose of the Board Strategic Days is to ensure that members of the Board have knowledge and understanding of the business activities of the Group, the business environment and the Group's strategic options and challenges. Directors' knowledge in these fields is crucial to allow well-founded Board resolutions, and to ensure that the Company takes due advantage of the different competences of the Directors. The Board Strategic Days also form an important platform for contacts between Directors and talent from different parts of Ericsson's organization where the Board gets the opportunity to meet Ericsson employees and leaders. Such contacts and meetings are highly valued by the Board as part of the Board's involvement in Ericsson's talent management.
During 2016, focus areas at Board Strategic Days included cyber security, 5G, Industry and Society, IoT and Media. As a rule, the Board Strategic Days also include sustainability and corporate responsibility updates for Board members.

whether the accounts, the management of funds and the general financial position of the Group are presented fairly in all material respects.
In addition, the Board reviews and assesses the process for financial reporting, as described below under "Internal control over financial reporting 2016". Combined with other steps taken internally, the Board's and the auditor's review of the interim and annual reports are deemed to give reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting.
Work of the Board of Directors in 2016 In 2016, 13 Board meetings were held. For a ttendance at Board meetings, see the table on page 145.
Strategy and risk management are always high on the Board's agenda and the bi-annual Board Strategic Days aim at providing the Board with good insight into these matters. Sustainability and corporate responsibility are increasingly important to Ericsson and are integrated into Ericsson's business strategy.
The Board continuously monitors the international developments and their possible impact on Ericsson. Industry transformation, talent management, cybersecurity, profitability, cost reductions and efficiency gains are among the matters that have continued to be in focus within Ericsson during the year. The Board also addressed the re-organization carried out during the year, and the process to appoint a new P resident and CEO.

Auditor involvement The Board meets with Ericsson's external auditor in closed sessions at least once a year to receive and consider the auditor's observations. The auditor reports to management on the accounting and financial reporting practices of the Group.
The Audit Committee also meets regularly with the auditor to receive and consider observations on the interim reports and the Annual Report. The auditor has been instructed to report on

Board work evaluation A key objective of the Board evaluation is to ensure that the Board work is functioning well. This includes gaining an understanding of the issues that the Board thinks warrant greater focus, as well as determining areas where additional competence is needed within the Board and whether the Board composition is appro priate. The evaluation also serves as guidance for the work of the Nomination Committee.

Each year, the Chairman of the Board initiates and leads the evaluation of the Board and Committee work and procedures. Evaluation tools include detailed questionnaires and discussions. The services of an external corporate advisory firm have been retained by the Company to assist in developing questionnaires, carrying out surveys and summarizing responses.
In 2016, Directors responded to written q uestionnaires, covering the Director's individual performance, Board work in general, Committee work and the Chairman's performance. The Chairman was not involved in the development or compilation of the questionnaire which related to his performance, nor was he present when his performance was evaluated. The Chairman evaluation was coordinated by one of the Deputy Chairmen, Jacob Wallenberg. As part of the evaluation process, the Chairman of the Board also had individual discussions with each of the Directors. The results from the evaluations were presented to the Board and were thoroughly discussed. An action plan was developed to further improve the work of the Board. The Nomination Committee was informed of the results of the Board work and Chairman evaluation.
Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has established three Committees: the Audit Committee, the Finance Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Members of each Committee are appointed for one year from amongst the Board members. In January 2017, the Board resolved to establish a fourth Board Committee for Technology and Science as from the statutory Board meeting to be held in connection with the 2017 Annual G eneral Meeting of shareholders.
The task of the Committees is mainly to prepare matters for resolution by the Board. However, the Board has authorized each Committee to determine and handle certain issues in limited areas. It may also on occasion provide extended authorization for the Committees to determine specific matters.

If deemed appropriate, the Board of Directors and each Committee have the right to engage independent external expertise, either in general or with respect to specific matters.
Prior to the Board meetings, each Committee submits the minutes of Committee meetings to the Board and the Chairman of the Committee reports on the work of the Committee at each Board meeting.
Audit Committee On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee monitors the following: >> The scope and accuracy of the financial
statements >> Compliance with legal and regulatory require-
ments >> Internal control over financial reporting >> Risk management >> The effectiveness and appropriateness of the
Group's anti-corruption program.
The Audit Committee also reviews the annual and interim financial reports and oversees the external audit process, including audit fees.
The Audit Committee itself does not perform audit work. Ericsson's internal audit function reports directly to the Audit Committee.
Ericsson's external auditor is elected by the AGM. The Committee is involved in the prepa ratory work for the Nomination Committee to propose external auditor for election by the AGM. It also monitors Group transactions and the ongoing performance and independence of the auditor with the aim to avoid conflicts of interest.
In order to ensure the auditor's independence, the Audit Committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures for non-audit related services to be performed by the external auditor. Pre-approval authority may not be delegated to management.
The Audit Committee also oversees Ericsson's process for reviewing transactions with related parties and Ericsson's whistle-blower procedures.

ment, and >> relate to corruption, questionable accounting
or auditing matters or otherwise seriously affect vital interests of the Group or personal health and safety.
Violations reported through the Ericsson Compliance Line are handled by Ericsson's Group Compliance Forum, consisting of representatives from Ericsson's internal audit function, Group Function Legal Affairs, Group Security, and Group Function Human Resources.

Remuneration to Board members
Remuneration to Board members not employed by the Company is proposed by the Nomination Committee for resolution by the AGM.
The AGM 2016 approved the Nomination Committee's proposal for fees to non-employee Board members for Board and Committee work. For further information on Board of Directors' fees 2016, please refer to Notes to the consolidated financial statements ­ Note C28 "Information regarding members of the Board of Directors, the Group management and employees" in the Annual Report.
The AGM 2016 also approved the Nomination Committee's proposal that Board members may be paid part of their Board fee in the form of synthetic shares. A synthetic share gives the

right to receive a future cash payment of an amount which corresponds to the market value of a Class B share in Ericsson at the time of payment. The Director's right to receive payment with regard to allocated synthetic shares occurs, as a general rule, after the publication of the Company's year-end financial statement during the fifth year following the General Meeting that resolved on the allocation of the synthetic shares. The purpose of paying part of the Board of Directors' fee in the form of synthetic shares is to further align the Directors' interests with shareholder interests. For more information on the terms and conditions of the synthetic shares, please refer to the notice convening the AGM 2016 and to the minutes from the AGM 2016, which are available at Ericsson's website.

Management
The President/CEO and the Executive Leadership Team The Board of Directors appoints the President and CEO and the Executive Vice Presidents. The President and CEO is responsible for the management of day-to-day operations and is supported by the other members of the Execu tive Leadership Team (ELT). The ELT members as of December 31, 2016, are presented on pages 154­158 together with the new CEO appointed as of January 16, 2017.
The role of the ELT is to: >> Establish a strong corporate culture, a long-
term vision and Group strategies and policies, all based on objectives stated by the Board. >> Determine targets for operational units, allo cate resources and monitor unit performance. >> Secure operational excellence and realize global synergies through efficient organiza tion of the Group.
During 2016, many new appointments to the ELT were made following the re-organization effec tive July 1, 2016. During 2016, the ELT had a great focus on strategy execution and on ensur ing due implementation of the re-organization throughout Ericsson. Execution of the cost-effi ciency program has also been a prioritized area.
Remuneration to the Executive Leadership Team Guidelines for remuneration to the ELT were approved by the AGM 2016. For further informa tion on fixed and variable remuneration, see the

The Ericsson Group Management System Ericsson has one global management system, known as the Ericsson Group Management S ystem (EGMS) to drive corporate culture and to ensure that the business is managed: >> To fulfill the objectives of Ericsson's major
stakeholders (customers, shareholders, employees). >> Within established risk limits and with reliable internal control. >> In compliance with relevant applicable laws, listing requirements, governance codes and corporate responsibilities.
The EGMS is a framework consisting of rules and requirements for Ericsson's business, spec ified through process and organization descrip tions, policies, directives and instructions. The management system is applied in all Ericsson's operations globally, and its consistency and global reach is designed to build trust in the way Ericsson works. The EGMS is founded on ISO 9001 (international standard for quality manage ment systems) but is designed as a dynamic governance system, enabling Ericsson to adapt the system to evolving demands and expecta tions, including new legislation as well as cus tomers' and other stakeholders' requirements. Ericsson does not implement external require ments without analyzing them and putting them into the Ericsson context. The EGMS comprises three elements: >> Management and control >> Ericsson business processes >> Organization and resources.
Management and control Ericsson's strategy and target-setting processes consider the demands and expectations of customers as well as other key stakeholders. Ericsson uses balanced scorecards as tools for translating strategic objectives into a set of per formance indicators for its operational units. Based on annual strategy work, these score cards are updated with targets for each unit for the next year and are communicated throughout the organization.
Group-wide policies and directives govern how the organization works and are core ele ments in managing and controlling Ericsson. The Group Policies and Directives include, among other things, a Code of Business Ethics, a Code of Conduct and accounting and reporting direc tives to fulfill external reporting requirements.

150

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Ericsson has a Group Steering Documents Committee for purposes of aligning policies and directives with Group strategies, values and structures.
Ericsson business processes As a market leader, Ericsson utilizes the compet itive advantages that are gained through global scale and has implemented common processes and IT tools across all operational units world wide. Customer requirements are identified, clarified and formalized in Ericsson Business Processes where requirements transform from theory to practice. Ericsson attempts to reduce costs with efficient and effective process flows and with standardized internal controls and per formance indicators.
Organization and resources Ericsson is operated in two dimensions: one operational structure and one legal structure. The operational structure aligns accountability and authority regardless of country borders and supports the process flows with cross-country operations. In the operational structure, Ericsson is organized in group functions, segments, busi ness units, customer groups and regions. The legal structure is the basis for legal requirements and responsibility as well as for tax and statutory reporting purposes. There are more than 200 legal entities within the Ericsson Group with approximately 80 branch offices with represen tation (via legal entities, branch and representa tive offices) in more than 150 countries.
Chief Compliance Officer Ericsson has a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), reporting to the Chief Legal Officer. The CCO's responsibilities among other things include to further develop Ericsson's anti-corruption pro gram and the CCO regularly reports to the Audit Committee. Attention from senior-management level on anti-corruption and compliance is cru cial, as is ensuring that these matters are addressed from a cross-functional perspective. Ericsson's anti-corruption program is reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Committee at least annually.
Audits, assessments and certification The purpose of audits and assessments is to determine levels of compliance and to provide valuable information for understanding, analyz ing and continually improving performance. Management monitors compliance with policies, directives and processes through internal self-assessment within all units. This is comple mented by internal and external audits.
Due to demands and requirements from cus tomers and other external stakeholders, Ericsson sometimes needs to take decisions on certification in order to stay competitive in the

market. Certification means that Ericsson's inter pretation of standards or requirements are con firmed by a third-party assessment.
As the EGMS is a global system, group-wide certificates are issued by a third-party certifica tion body proving that the system is efficient throughout the whole organization. Ericsson is currently globally certified to ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environment) and OHSAS 18001 (Health & Safety). Selected Ericsson units are also certified to additional standards, for exam ple ISO 27001 (Information Security) and TL 9000 (telecom-specific standard). EGMS is also audited within the scope of the audit plan of Ericsson's internal audit function.
Ericsson's external financial audits are per formed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and ISO/ management system audits are performed by EY. Internal audits are performed by the compa ny's internal audit function which reports to the Audit Committee.
Ericsson conducts audits of suppliers in order to secure compliance with Ericsson's Code of Conduct, which includes rules that suppliers to the Ericsson Group must comply with.
Risk management Ericsson's risk management is integrated into the operational processes of the business, and is a part of the EGMS to ensure accountability, effectiveness, efficiency, business continuity and compliance with corporate governance, legal and other requirements. The Board of Directors also oversees the Company's risk management. Risks related to long-term objec tives for Ericsson's business units and customer groups are discussed and strategies are formally approved by the Board as part of the annual strategy process. Risks related to annual targets for the Company are also reviewed by the Board and then monitored continuously during the year. Certain transactional risks require specific Board approval, e.g. acquisitions, divestments management remuneration, borrowing or cus tomer finance in excess of pre-defined limits.
Operational, financial and compliance risks Operational and financial risk Operational risks are owned and managed by operational units. Risk management is embed ded in various process controls, such as deci sion tollgates and approvals. Certain cross-pro cess risks are centrally coordinated, such as information security, IT security, corporate responsibility and business continuity and insur able risks. Financial risk management is gov erned by a Group policy and carried out by the Treasury and Customer Finance functions, both supervised by the Finance Committee. The pol icy governs risk exposures related to foreign exchange, liquidity/financing, interest rates, credit risk and market price risk in equity instru

ments. For further information on financial risk management, see Notes to the consolidated financial statements ­ Note C14, "Trade receiv ables and customer finance," Note C19, "Inter est-bearing liabilities" and Note C20, "Financial risk management and financial instruments" in the Annual Report.
Compliance risks Ericsson has implemented Group policies and directives in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as its Code of B usiness Ethics and Code of Conduct. Risk management is integrated in the Company's business processes. Policies and controls are implemented to comply with financial reporting standards and stock market regulations.
Risk mitigation Examples of significant activities to mitigate risks are: >> Conducting regular supplier Code of Conduct
audits >> Continuously assessing and managing risks
relating to Corporate Responsibility including anti-corruption >> Conducting business continuity management in an efficient way >> Continuously monitoring information systems to guard against data breaches >> Reviewing top risks and mitigating actions in regular monthly reporting and at various inter nal governance meetings

Strategic and tactical risks Strategic risks constitute the highest risk to the Company if not managed properly as they could have a long-term impact. Ericsson therefore reviews its long-term objectives, main strategies and business scope on an annual basis and continuously works on its tactics to reach these objectives and to mitigate any risks identified.
Objectives are set for three to five years in the annual strategy process and for one year in the target setting process. Risks are assessed and strategies are developed to achieve the objec tives. The strategy process in the Company is well established and involves regions, business units, customer groups and group functions. The strategy is summarized and discussed in a yearly Leadership Summit with approximately 300 leaders from all parts of the business attending. By involving all parts of the business in the process, potential risks are identified early and mitigating actions can be incorporated in the strategy and in the annual target-setting pro cess following the finalization of the strategy.
Key components in the evaluation of risk related to Ericsson's long-term objectives include for example technology development, cyber security related matters, industry and market fundamentals, the development of the economy, the political and international environ ment, health and environmental aspects and laws and regulations.
The outcome of the strategy process forms the basis for the annual target-setting process,

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

Internal control over financial reporting 2016
This section has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Corporate Gover nance Code and is limited to internal control over financial reporting.
Since Ericsson is listed in the United States, the requirements outlined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) apply, subject to certain exceptions. These regulate the establishment and maintenance of internal control over financial reporting as well as management's assessment of the effectiveness of the controls.
In order to support high-quality reporting and to meet the requirement of SOX, the Company has implemented detailed documented controls and testing and reporting procedures based on the internationally established 2013 COSO framework for internal control. The COSO frame work is issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organi zations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Management's internal control report according to SOX will be included in Ericsson's Annual Report on Form 20-F and filed with the SEC in the United States.
Disclosure policies Ericsson's financial reporting and disclosure policies aim to ensure transparent, relevant and consistent communi cation with equity and debt investors on a timely, fair and equal basis. This will support a fair market value for Ericsson securities. Ericsson wants current and potential investors to have a good understanding of how the Com pany works, including operational performance, pros pects and potential risks.
To achieve these objectives, financial reporting and disclosure must be: >> Transparent ­ enhancing understanding of the eco
nomic drivers and operational performance of the business, building trust and credibility. >> Consistent ­ comparable in scope and level of detail to facilitate comparison between reporting periods. >> Simple ­ to support understanding of business opera tions and performance and to avoid misinterpretations. >> Relevant ­ with focus on what is relevant to Ericsson's stakeholders or required by regulation or listing agree ments, to avoid information overload. >> Timely ­ with regularly scheduled disclosures as well as ad-hoc information, such as press releases on important events, performed in a timely manner. >> Fair and equal ­ where all material information is pub lished via press releases to ensure that the whole investor community receives the information at the same time. >> Complete, free from material errors and a reflection of best practice ­ disclosures compliant with applicable financial reporting standards and listing requirements and in line with industry norms.

Disclosure controls and procedures Ericsson has controls and procedures in place to allow for timely disclosure in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and under agreements with Nasdaq Stock holm and NASDAQ New York. These procedures also require that such information is provided to management, including the CEO and the CFO, so timely decisions can be made regarding required disclosure.
The Disclosure Committee comprises members with various expertise. It assists management in fulfilling their responsibility regarding disclosures made to the share holders and the investment community. One of the main tasks of the committee is to monitor the integrity and effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures.
Ericsson has investments in certain entities that the Company does not control or manage. With respect to such entities, disclosure controls and procedures are substantially more limited than those maintained with respect to subsidiaries.
Ericsson's President and CEO and the CFO evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were effective at a reasonable assur ance level as of December 31, 2016. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Internal control over financial reporting Ericsson has integrated risk management and internal control into its business processes. As defined in the COSO framework, internal control is an aggregation of components such as a control environment, risk assess ment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring.
During the period covered by the Annual Report 2016, there were no changes to the internal control over finan cial reporting that have materially affected, or are reason ably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
Control environment The Company's internal control structure is based on the division of tasks between the Board of Directors and its Committees and the President and CEO. The Company has implemented a management system that is based on: >> Steering documents, such as policies, directives and a
Code of Business Ethics. >> A strong corporate culture. >> The Company's organization and mode of operations,
with well-defined roles and responsibilities and dele gations of authority. >> Several well-defined Group-wide processes for plan ning, operations and support.

Ericsson's website comprises comprehensive informa tion on the Group, including: >> An archive of annual and interim reports. >> Access to recent news.

Corporate Governance ­ Corporate Governance Report

Ericsson | Annual Report 2016

159

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ­ Corporate Governance Report

The most essential parts of the control environment rela tive to financial reporting are included in steering docu ments and processes for accounting and financial report ing. These steering documents are updated regularly to include, among other things: >> Changes to laws. >> Financial reporting standards and listing requirements,
such as IFRS and SOX.
The processes include specific controls to be performed to ensure high-quality financial reports. The management of each reporting legal entity, region and business unit is supported by a financial controller function with execu tion of controls related to transactions and reporting. The financial controller functions are organized in a number of Company Control Hubs, each supporting a number of legal entities within a geographical area. A financial con troller function is also established on Group level, report ing to the CFO.
Risk assessment Risks of material misstatements in financial reporting may exist in relation to recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, revenue and cost or insufficient disclo sure. Other risks related to financial reporting include fraud, loss or embezzlement of assets and undue favor able treatment of counterparties at the expense of the Company.
Policies and directives regarding accounting and financial reporting cover areas of particular significance to support correct, complete and timely accounting, reporting and disclosure.
Identified types of risks are mitigated through well-de fined business processes with integrated risk management activities, segregation of duties and appropriate delegation of authority. This requires specific approval of material transactions and ensures adequate asset management.
Control activities The Company's business processes include financial controls regarding the approval and accounting of busi ness transactions. The financial closing and reporting process has controls regarding recognition, measure ment and disclosure. These include the application of critical accounting policies and estimates, in individual subsidiaries as well as in the consolidated accounts.
Regular analyses of the financial results for each sub sidiary, region and business unit cover the significant ele ments of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flow. Together with further analysis of the consolidated finan cial statements performed at Group level, these proce dures are designed to produce financial reports without material errors.
For external financial reporting purposes, the Dis closure Committee performs additional control proce dures to review whether the disclosure requirements are fulfilled.

The Company has implemented controls to ensure that financial reports are prepared in accordance with its internal accounting and reporting policies and IFRS as well as with relevant listing regulations. It maintains detailed documentation on internal controls related to accounting and financial reporting. It also keeps records on the monitoring of the execution and results of such controls. This allows the President and CEO and the CFO to assess the effectiveness of the controls in a way that is compliant with SOX.
Entity-wide controls, focusing on the control environ ment and compliance with financial reporting policies and directives, are implemented in all subsidiaries. Detailed process controls and documentation of controls performed are also implemented in almost all subsidiar ies, covering the items with significant materiality and risk.
In order to secure compliance, governance and risk management in the areas of legal entity accounting and taxation, as well as securing funding and equity levels, the Company operates through a Company Control hub structure, covering subsidiaries in each respective geo graphical area. During 2016, the Company further devel oped its internal control function within Group Function Finance, Financial Control to cover a wider scope than previously.
Based on a common IT platform, a common chart of account and common master data, the hubs and shared services centers perform accounting and financial reporting services for most subsidiaries.
Information and communication The Company's information and communication chan nels support complete, correct and timely financial reporting by making all relevant internal process instruc tions and policies accessible to all the employees c oncerned. Regular updates and briefing documents regarding changes in accounting policies, reporting and disclosure requirements are also supplied.
Subsidiaries and operating units prepare regular finan cial and management reports for internal steering groups and Company management. These include analysis and comments on financial performance and risks. The Board of Directors receives financial reports monthly. Ericsson has established a whistleblower tool, Ericsson Compliance Line, that can be used for the reporting of alleged violations that: >> are conducted by Group or local management, and >> relate to corruption, questionable accounting or audit
ing matters or otherwise seriously affect vital interests of the Group or personal health and safety.
Monitoring The Company's process for financial reporting is reviewed annually by management. This forms a basis for evaluating the internal management system and inter nal steering documents to ensure that they cover all sig nificant areas related to financial reporting. The shared

160

service center and Company Control hub management continuously monitor accounting quality through a set of performance indicators. Compliance with policies and directives is monitored through annual self-assessments and representation letters from heads and company controllers in subsidiaries as well as in business units and regions.
The Company's financial performance is also reviewed at each Board meeting. The Committees of the Board fulfill important monitoring functions regarding remune

ration, borrowing, investments, customer finance, cash management, financial reporting and internal control. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors review all interim and annual financial reports before they are released to the market. The Company's internal audit function reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from the external auditor. The Audit Committee follows up on any actions taken to improve or modify controls.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION REPORT

Introduction
This report outlines how the remuneration policy is implemented throughout Ericsson in line with corporate governance best practice, with specific references to Group management.
The work of the Remuneration Committee in 2016 and the remuneration policy are explained below, followed by descriptions of plans and their outcomes.
More details on the remuneration of Group management and Board members' fees can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated financial statements ­ Note C28, "Information regarding members of the Board of Directors, the Group management and employees" in the Annual Report.
Board member remuneration is resolved annually by the Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) advises the Board of Directors on the remuneration to the Group management, consisting of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). This includes fixed salaries, pensions, other benefits and short-and long-term variable compensation. The Committee reviews and prepares for resolution by the Board: >> Proposals on salary and other remuneration, including retire-
ment compensation, for the President and CEO. >> Proposals to the Annual General Meeting on guidelines for
remuneration to the ELT. >> Proposals to the Annual General Meeting on long-term variable
compensation and equity arrangements.
The responsibility of the Committee is also to: >> Approve proposals on salary and other remuneration, including
retirement compensation, for the ELT members. >> Approve proposals on targets for the short-term variable
c ompensation (STV) for the ELT members. The new President & CEO, Börje Ekholm, does not have any short-term variable compensation. >> Approve payout of the short-term variable compensation for the ELT, based on achievements and performance.
The Committee's work forms the foundation for the governance of Ericsson's remuneration processes, together with Ericsson's internal systems and audit controls. The Committee is chaired by Leif Johansson and its other members are Roxanne S. Austin

and Karin Åberg. Börje Ekholm was a member of the Committee until his appointment as President and CEO effective January 16, 2017, at which point he left the Committee. All members are non- executive directors, independent (except for the employee representative) as required by the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and have relevant knowledge and experience of remuneration matters.
The Company's Chief Legal Officer acts as secretary to the Committee. The President and CEO, the Senior Vice President, Head of Human Resources, the Vice President, Head of Total Rewards and the Head of Executive Remuneration attend Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its considerations. Nobody is present at the Committee´s meeting when issues relating to their own remuneration are being discussed.
The Committee used an independent expert advisor, Piia Pilv, to assist and advise in its work during 2016. The independent advisor provided no other services to the Company during 2016. At its final meeting in 2016, the Committee resolved to appoint Peter Boreham at Mercer as its independent advisor for 2017. The Committee is also furnished with national and international pay data collected from external survey providers and can call on other independent expertise, should it so require. The Chairman strives to ensure that contact is maintained, as necessary and appropriate, with shareholders regarding remuneration.
Further information on the Committee and its responsibilities can be found in the Corporate Governance Report. These responsibilities, together with the Guidelines for remuneration to Group management and the Long-Term Variable (LTV) compensation program is reviewed and evaluated annually in light of matters such as changes to corporate governance best practice or changes to accounting, legislation, political opinion or business practices among peers. This helps to ensure that the policy continues to provide Ericsson with a competitive remuneration strategy.
The Guidelines for remuneration to Group management are, in accordance with Swedish law, brought to shareholders annually for approval.
The Committee held seven meetings during 2016. The winter meetings focused on following up on results from the 2015 variable compensation programs and preparing proposals to shareholders for the 2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM). The Committee proposed to the Board of Directors to approve the LTV 2013 vesting result. During spring and summer, the Committee reviewed and approved the remuneration for a number of new appointments to the ELT as well as revised STV targets for the ELT. During fall, the Committee completed its annual overview of the global technology sector pay practices together with the independent

Remuneration policy

Remuneration at Ericsson is based on the principles of performance, competitiveness and fairness. The remuneration policy, together with the mix of remuneration elements, is designed to reflect these principles by creating a balanced remuneration package. The Guidelines for remuneration to

Group management 2016, approved by the AGM, can be found in Note C28. The auditor's report regarding whether the company has complied with the guidelines for remuneration to Group management during 2016 is posted on the Ericsson website.

advisor. As in previous years, the Committee concluded that Ericsson's remuneration level is competitive but that the pay mix is more fixed in nature with larger emphasis on base salary compared to typical market practice in the US, Europe and Asia. In the high-tech industry, the prevalent long-term incentive vehicle is restricted shares (shares that vest based on time only) as retention and recognition continue to be the key drivers for plan design. Ericsson's Long-Term Variable Compensation program (LTV) is the least competitive remuneration element in terms of design and levels in the total compensation package. The Committee has therefore worked to prepare a new long-term incentive arrangement for Ericsson's Global Leadership Team (GLT) which is proposed for approval at the 2017 Annual General Meeting of shareholders. Towards the end of 2016, the Committee approved the CEO proposal for salary adjustments for the ELT and established the framework for the short-term targets for 2017.

Total remuneration in 2016
When considering the remuneration of an individual, it is the total remuneration that matters. First, the total annual cash compensation is defined, consisting of the target level of short-term variable compensation plus fixed salary. Thereafter, target long-term variable compensation is added to get to the total target compensation and, finally, pension and other benefits are added to arrive at the total remuneration.
For the ELT, remuneration consists of fixed salary, short-term and long-term variable compensation, pension and other benefits. If the size of any one of these elements is increased or decreased when setting the remuneration, at least one other element has to change if the total compensation is to remain unchanged.
The remuneration costs for the CEO and the ELT are reported in Note C28.

Evaluation of the Guidelines for remuneration to Group management and of the LTV program The Committee supports the Board with the review and evaluation of the Guidelines for remuneration to Group management and Ericsson's application of these guidelines. The Committee and the Board have concluded that the guidelines remain valid and right for Ericsson and that the only change to the guidelines for 2017 shall be to allow the use of share-price related targets in the variable compensation programs.
The number of participants in the Stock Purchase Plan with the objective to promote employees to become shareholders were as of December 1, 2016 approximately 31,500 employees (34,000 as of December 1, 2015). The evaluation confirms that the Key Contributor Retention Plan meets the purpose of retaining the Company's key employees. The voluntary attrition rate among Key Contributors is far smaller compared to the overall employee attrition rate. However, the Stock Purchase Plan has been criticized by the owners and after careful consideration the Committee concluded that the plan have an unsustainable share dilution effect. Therefore, the Committee recommended to the Board to not propose a new Stock Purchase Plan for 2017. Thereby the Executive Performance Stock Plan will also be obsolete as it is built on the Stock Purchase Plan. A new long-term incentive program for the GLT will be proposed for approval at the 2017 Annual General Meeting of shareholders. For other senior management and key contributors in Ericsson, cash-based arrangements will be developed.

Fixed salary When setting fixed salaries, the Committee cons iders the impact on total remuneration, including pensions and associated costs. The absolute levels are determined based on the size and complexity of the position and the year-on-year performance of the individual. Together with other elements of remuneration, ELT s alaries are subject to an annual review by the Committee, which considers external pay data to ensure that levels of pay remain competitive and appropriate to the remuneration policy.
Variable compensation Ericsson strongly believes that, where possible, variable comp ensation should be encouraged as an integral part of total remuneration. First and foremost, this aligns employees with clear and relevant targets, but it also enables more flexible payroll costs and emphasizes the link between performance and pay.
All variable compensation plans have maximum award and vesting limits. Short-term variable compensation is to a greater extent dependent on the performance of the specific unit or function, while long-term variable compensation is dependent on the achievements of the Ericsson Group.
Ericsson measures business performance according to five categories of measurements derived from the overall strategy: growing sales faster than the market, best-in-class operating margin, strong cash conversion, customer satisfaction and employee engagement. These categories have formed the basis for the short- and long-term variable compensation programs and have set the framework of what measurements shall be used for variable compensation.

Short-term variable compensation Annual variable compensation is delivered through cash-based programs. Specific business targets are derived from the annual business plan approved by the Board of Directors and, in turn, defined by the Company's long-term strategy. Ericsson strives to grow faster than the market with best-in-class margins and strong cash conversion and therefore the starting point is to have three core targets: >> Net sales >> Operating income >> Cash flow
For the ELT, targets are financial at either Group level (for Heads of Group functions and business units) or at the individual unit level (for Heads of regions or customer groups).
The chart on the previous page illustrates how payouts to the ELT have varied with performance over the past five years.
The Board of Directors decided on the financial targets for the former CEO (the new CEO does not have any short-term variable compensation), and the Committee decides on all targets which are set for the ELT. These targets are cascaded within the organization and broken down to unit-related targets throughout the Company. This is always subject to a two-level management approval process. The Committee monitors the appropriateness and fairness of Group target levels throughout the performance year and has the authority to revise them should they cease to be relevant or stretching or to enhance shareholder value.
During 2016, approximately 85,600 employees participated in short-term variable compensation plans.
Long-term variable compensation Share-based long-term variable compensation plans have been subm itted each year for approval by shareholders at the AGM.
All long-term variable compensation plans have been designed to form part of a well-balanced total remuneration package and to span over a minimum of three years. As these are variable plans, outcomes are unknown and rewards depend on long-term per-

sonal investment, corporate performance and the share price performance. During 2016, share-based compensation was made up of three different but linked plans: the all-employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Key Contributor Retention Plan and the Executive P erformance Stock Plan.
The Stock Purchase Plan The all-employee Stock Purchase Plan was designed to offer, where practicable, an incentive for all employees to participate. Employees can save up to 7.5% of gross fixed salary (the former President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, could save up to 10% of gross fixed salary and short-term variable compensation) for purchase of Class B shares at market price on Nasdaq Stockholm or ADSs on NASDAQ New York (Contribution Shares) over a twelvemonth period. If the Contribution Shares are retained by the employee for three years after the investment and employment with the Ericsson Group continues during that time, then the Contribution Shares will be matched with a corresponding number of Class B shares or ADSs, as applicable. The plan was introduced in 2002 and employees in 71 countries participated during its first year. In December 2016, the number of participants was approximately 31,500, or approximately 29% of eligible employees in 100 countries.
Participants save each month, beginning with the August p ayroll, towards quarterly investments. These investments (in November, February, May and August) are matched on the third anniversary of each such investment and hence the matching spans over two financial years and two tax years.
For the reasons previously outlined, no Stock Purchase Plan is being proposed for 2017.
The Key Contributor Retention Plan The Key Contributor Retention Plan has been part of Ericsson's talent management strategy. It was designed to recognize individuals for performance, critical skills and potential as well as to encourage retention of key employees.
Under the program, operating units around the world could

nominate up to 10% of employees worldwide. Each unit nominated individuals identified according to performance, critical skills and potential. The nominations were calibrated in m anagement teams locally and were reviewed by both local and corporate Human Resources.
Participants selected obtain one extra matching share in addition to the one matching share for each contribution share purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan during a twelve-month investment period. The plan was introduced in 2004.
Since no Stock Purchase Plan will be proposed for 2017, alternative arrangements will be developed to replace the Key Contributor Plan.
The Executive Performance Stock Plan The Executive Performance Stock Plan was first introduced in 2004. The plan was designed to focus management on driving long-term financial performance and to provide market-competitive remuneration. Senior managers, including the ELT, were selected to obtain up to four or six extra shares (performance- matching shares). This is in addition to the one matching share for each contribution share purchased under the all-employee Stock Purchase Plan. The former President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, could obtain up to nine performance-matching shares in addition to the Stock Purchase Plan matching share for each contribution share. Performance matching is subject to the fulfillment of per formance targets.
To support the long-term strategy and value creation the following targets for the 2016 Executive Performance Stock Plan were resolved at the AGM on proposal by the Board: >> Net Sales Growth: Up to one-third of the award will vest if the
compound annual growth rate of consolidated net sales is between 2 and 6% comparing 2018 financial results to 2015. >> Operating Income Growth: Up to one-third of the award will vest if the compound annual growth rate of consolidated operating income is between 5 and 15% comparing 2018 financial results to 2015. Extraordinary restructuring charges are excluded. >> Cash Conversion: Up to one-third of the award will vest if cash conversion is at or above 70% during each of the years 2016­2018, vesting one ninth of the total award for each year the target is achieved. Extraordinary restructuring charges are excluded.
Before the number of performance shares to be matched are finally determined, the Board of Directors shall examine whether the performance matching is reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position, conditions on the share market and other circumstances, and if not, as determined by the Board of Directors, reduce the number of performance shares to be matched to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by

the Board of Directors. When undertaking its evaluation of per formance, the Board of Directors will consider, in particular, the impact of larger acquisitions, divestments, the creation of joint ventures and any other significant capital event on the three targets on a case-by-case basis.
Since no Stock Purchase Plan will be proposed for 2017, alternative arrangements will be developed to replace the Executive Performance Stock Plan. For the Global Leadership Team, a share-based arrangement is proposed for approval by the 2017 Annual General Meeting of shareholders. Details of the performance criteria for the new long-term incentive program are outlined in the 2017 notice of Annual General Meeting of shareholders.
Benefits and terms of employment Pension benefits follow the competitive practice in the employee's home country and may contain various supplementary plans, in addition to any national system for social security. Where possible, pension plans are operated on a defined contribution basis, i.e. Ericsson pays contributions but does not guarantee the ultimate benefit. This applies unless local regulations or legislation prescribe that defined benefit plans that do give such guarantees have to be offered.
For the former President and CEO, Hans Vestberg, and other members of the ELT employed in Sweden before 2011, a supplementary pension plan is applied in addition to the occupational pension plan for salaried staff on the Swedish labor market (ITP).
The ELT members employed in Sweden since 2011 are normally covered by the defined contribution plan under the ITP1 scheme.
For members of the ELT who are not employed in Sweden, local market competitive pension arrangements apply.
Other benefits, such as company cars and medical insurance, are also set to be competitive in the local market. The ELT members may not receive loans from the Company.
The ELT members locally employed in Sweden have a mutual notice period of up to six months. Upon termination of employment by the Company, severance pay can amount to up to 18 months' fixed salary.
Remuneration policy in practice
Ericsson has taken a number of measures over the years to enhance the understanding of how the company translates remuneration principles and policy into practice. This includes the launch of an Integrated Human Resources IT tool, and providing e-learning and training programs to line managers. Since then, enhancements of the IT tool and continuous briefings of line managers on pay principles and their practical execution enabled further progress towards globally consistent principles while allowing room for adaptation to local legislation and pay markets.

Purpose of the capital markets communications Ericsson's overall goal is to create shareholder value. The communication with the capital mar kets aims to support the Company's overall goal by ensuring increased understanding and decre ased share volatility through transparency and clear messages. The Investor Relations depart ment serves as the bridge between the Compa ny's strategic planning , development and activi ties, and the external valuation and perception.
Goals and measurement Surveys are carried out on a regular basis to gauge the perceptions of messages at capital markets days, the web site, road shows and the availability and credibility of the IR department and the executive management.
Ericsson aims to maintain a long-term relation ship with its shareholders, and the IR department monitors shareholder turnover on a regular basis.
IR activities are linked to the Company strategy and development Throughout the year, the IR department carries out a number of activities aiming at meeting the goals of transparent communication and increased understanding. There are about 600 IR meetings with investors and analysts every year. The IR department also participates in communi cations such as product launches, M&A-activities etc, to ensure that financial communication is clear and relevant for the capital markets.
Working with other functions in the company While communication with the rating institutions primarily falls with Group function Treasury, the IR department is also involved on a regular basis.

As there is an existing US bond program, as well as a large shareholder base, Treasury and IR do a joint annual roadshow to meet bondholders in the US market.
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility (SCR) is of increasing importance for many inves tors. IR is together with the Ericsson SCR function performing several activities in this area during the year, including presentations for stakeholders and one-on-one investor meetings at SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) focused conferences.
Activities at Industry events The IR department also participates at important industry events such as the annual Mobile World Congress. The IR activities include communica tion relating to important Company news, but also setting up meetings between Company spokes people and different stakeholders.
IR in Transformation Ericsson is transforming from a leader in telecom munications and related services into a leader in the ICT arena.
Simultaneously, the stakeholders in the capital markets have also transformed in recent years; from industry-specialists focusing on the technology sector to generalists covering several sectors. It has become increasingly important for the financial communication to make it easy for stakeholders to make the connection between the Company's activ ities and development and its long-term strategy, thus putting higher demands on clear messages.
With two thirds of Ericsson's holdings outside of Sweden, the demand for availability at a global level also means working with other tools besides regular meetings, such as digital media.

Investors and financial analysts Q&a

Was Ericsson surprised by the s ignificant sales decline in 2016? A macro-economic environment weaker than expected had an increasing negative effect on demand during the year in many emerging markets, leading to an unex pected market decline. In addition, delayed 4G spectrum auctions slowed down investments in India. Business in markets such as North America and mainland China have developed in line with plan.
What is Ericsson doing to improve the results? Profitability has declined and is below Ericsson's ambitions. There are three focus areas to drive incremental profit improvements; improve efficiency, mone tize Networks and build success in IT & Cloud, Media and Industry and Society. The cost and efficiency program is tracking towards target and has been expanded to adjust the organization to lower sales volumes.
Is Ericsson losing market shares? The ongoing large deployments in China, where Chinese vendors have a large market share, impacts the global market shares between vendors. The sales reduc tion in 2016 was driven by weaker demand in mobile broadband, especially in markets with weak macro-economic environment.

What is the situation in emerging markets? In 2016, there was a challenging situation in markets impacted by weak macro-eco nomic environment. The situation is likely to prevail in 2017 based on current visibil ity. Future sales development is depending on macro development in those countries. After a slowdown it normally takes time before investments start and activities are picking up.
Are the ongoing cost reductions enough for restoring profits? Ericsson believes the actions are sufficient to increase profitability with current market conditions, but are always seeking further opportunities to reduce cost and increase efficiency.
There has been several articles in Swedish media on Ericsson in 2016, comments? There have been continued reports in Swedish media concerning Ericsson. Ericsson has posted clarifying statements which are available on the Company's website in order to give the correct company view.
https://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/ press/ericsson-comments

Ericsson has a zero tolerance approach to corruption, and the Company has worked systematically over the years to continu ously strengthen and improve its approach. By the end of 2016, over 95,900 employees have completed the anti-corr uption e-learning launched in 2013.
Will recent headcount reductions impact future innovation and risk necessary R&D investments? Ericsson is reducing the cost level in light of current market conditions, while safe guarding enough investments in R&D to secure leadership in future technologies such as 5G. The reduction also involves ways of working to increase productivity and get more value from every dollar invested in R&D.
US dollar has strengthened compared to several currencies, how has this impacted the result? Compared to 2015, the USD strengthened with a positive impact when translating USD to SEK in the financial statements. However, the strengthened US dollar also had a negative impact on operator invest ments in several markets.

alternative performance measures

This section includes a reconciliation of certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to the most directly reconcilable line items in the financial statements. The presentation of APMs has limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for related financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.
APMs are presented to enhance an investor's evaluation of ongoing operating results, to aid in forecasting future periods and to facilitate meaningful comparison of results between periods.

Management uses these APMs to, among other things, evaluate ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of c ertain performance-based compensation.
The APMs presented in this report may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.
