"We have consolidated the growth path we started two years ago"

The trends we have been observing since 2015 have not only continued but have also accelerated in certain Southern European markets. In this context, 2016 was an excellent year for Fluidra. We consolidated the growth path that we initiated two years ago and carried on with the development that has characterised our group since it was founded. We have continued recovering efficiency and profitability levels, consolidating and settling our fundamentals. During 2016, we proved our ability to increase yields in a more positive environment compared to previous years. Once again, we demonstrated the financial strength that our group has.
Organic growth was solid and consistent throughout the year. Our presence in southern Europe's markets showed very positive trend with double-digit growth, and it is also worth noting Australia's excellent performance consistently displaying high growth rates. In general terms, all of our markets maintain positive trends, except for a few minor markets such as China. This performance is especially noteworthy when considering the uncertainties that had haunted the markets in the previous twelve months: the UK's vote to leave the European Union; the presidential elections in the United States; the political turmoil in Brazil and Italy; and oil price volatility.
A year of investment
In 2016, following our philosophy of expanding and consolidating markets, we invested in growth.
Growth in Europe, together with the change in logistic model, led us to expand our facilities in Trace Logistic in order to further develop our service and branch model in this region. The deployment of the new branch model (cash & carry), which allowed us to lighten the weight of our capillarity in southern Europe, is based on the centralisation of upstream stocks in the supply chain seeking to improve the level of service and support the implementation of a more efficient delegation model throughout the region.
We made a significant investment in Australia to absorb the growth in this area, by moving to a new plant with greater capacity and simultaneously consolidating central logistics. We also invested to accelerate our Waterlinx integration plan, the leading South African company we acquired in August 2015. The analysis made prior to the purchase, which accounted for the plans of the South African management team and the implementation of Fluidra's best practices, provided us with an opportunity to improve both in terms of production and the logistics system. In this regard, we

2016

INTEGRATED REPORT

Main figures for 2016 Business model

Letter from the President Strategy 2016

carried out the consolidation of both the different production plants and the logistics central warehouses. Both new sites in Australia and in South Africa are rented, so we only incur in investments directly related to our operations.
"All these investments are part of our strategy which includes geographical penetration, product portfolio, growth and improvements in efficiency and profitability"
In July, Fluidra acquired 70% of Sibo B.V.'s capital, a leading Dutch swimming pool and water facilities company (water gardens and natural pools or bio-pools) with a strong retail presence in Benelux and Germany. With this acquisition, we are positive that we will have more access to different northern European markets, a potential market of about 50 million euros per year, with over 230,000 residential pools installed and a commercial pools inventory of about 5,000 units. Besides, SIBO is a global leader in bio-pools, that is, biological or natural pools, an eco-friendly trend booming in northern Europe. Although this type of pool represents slightly less than 2% of the total inventory in this European region, it is gaining momentum exponentially as a highly environmentally friendly alternative.

Letter from the President Strategy 2016

"We were awarded two major projects in Southeast Asia: 2017 Taipei Summer Universiade and 2018 Asian Games"

Thanks to the work of our commercial pool business consulting division, we were awarded two major projects in Southeast Asia: 2017 Taipei Summer Universiade (award worth EUR 5 million) and 2018 Asian Games Jakarta (for EUR 4 million). Both contracts are examples of the extensive capabilities of our group in the world of swimming pools and wellness.
We have continued to innovate in new, more efficient and environmentally friendly products, such as Internet of Pools (Fluidra Connect), LumiPlus Design, the Neolysis process, AstralPool Mac, the range of Viron pumps or the large FreePool project that will be a watershed in indoor public swimming pools. Every year, we allocate around 1.5% of our consolidated sales to R&D&i, and these products and developments are the result of this investment. We seek solutions to the needs of our direct customers and so that the end user of a pool or wellness installation can get the most from the pool, making it more sustainable, efficient, increasing the time of enjoyment and at the lowest possible cost.
Annual figures
Fluidra's sales at year-end 2016 stood at EUR 713.3 million, 10.2% higher than in 2015. The financial recovery of Spain, France, Australia and other mature markets, along with our restructuring efforts and strong financial discipline and a solid balance sheet enabled us to close this financial year with EBITDA growth of 19.1%, reaching EUR 86 million, which represented a 12.1% EBITDA margin on sales, higher than that of 2015 which stood at 11.2%.
The company's net profits stood at EUR 24.1 million, an increase of 85.2% compared to the previous year.
In terms of balance sheet, the excellent performance across all items comprising net working capital should be noted. At the end of 2016, it stood at EUR 184 million, representing a net working capital to sales ratio of 25.8%. Free cash generation to the income statement was EUR 27.4 million.
Net Financial Debt (NFD) reached EUR 156.6 million at the end of 2016. The multiple of NFD / EBITDA stood at 1.8, below 2.2x in 2015.

Letter from the President Strategy 2016

2016 was an excellent year. Markets welcomed our strong performance throughout the year. All in all, completing our 2018 Strategic Plan, the investments made throughout the year and the growth of our business in mature markets led to a 38% increase in Fluidra's value in the markets, setting the closing price in 2016 at EUR 4.32 per share, while share liquidity increased alongside trading growth.
Strategy for the future
2017 got off to a good start, on the back of the year just ended. And that gives us the certainty that the current year will be better for both Fluidra and the international economy as a whole. We have flexibility and financial strength, and a team of great professionals who are fully committed to this project. Therefore, we will continue working hard to achieve our profitability and efficiency goals, gaining market share in mature markets and aiming to become leaders in markets and in product categories in which we are not yet leaders.
"We will continue working hard to achieve our profitability and efficiency goals, gaining market share in mature markets and seeking to lead those in which we are not the leading company"

We focus on implementing our strategy, which is based on:
· Showcasing swimming pool & wellness.
· Ensuring our product categories penetrate in all countries in which we have a presence to increase our shares and leading position.
· Implementing best practices that will allow us to increase our efficiency and profitability ratios. .
Our commitments
We will continue to uphold and increase our commitment to society and the environment, as well as to all our stakeholders, that is, within the framework of a truly sustainable economy. We will also continue to develop products and roll out projects that provide efficient, cutting-edge solutions to our customers.

Letter from the President Strategy 2016

This year, we established the Fluidra Foundation with the main objective of promoting responsible and sustainable use and enjoyment of water as a natural and essential resource for humankind, taking advantage of the group's knowledge of water resources.
Led by Joan Planes, founder and honorary president of Fluidra, the activities of the Fluidra Foundation are aligned with two basic commitments: a social commitment to projects aimed at accessibility, awareness and education on water use, and a cultural commitment focused especially on promoting music. In an effort to become leaders in sustainability and efficiency, our aim is to preserve water, a resource essential for life that is ever so scarce.
The principles of the United Nations Global Compact inspire of our ethics and social responsibility. That is why we renew our commitment to the initiative for yet another year, as well as to these values as a guide on how to develop and walk towards a sustainable management.
We want to be a global group offering sustainable and efficient pool solutions and applications. A leading company in the Pool & Wellness sector worldwide.
Water is our world and our future.
Once again, I would like to thank you for the confidence that you have placed in Fluidra.

Research, development and innovation remain one of the key pillars of Fluidra's future: the company's goal is to create a culture of innovation to become an industry leader. To this end, it has the support of the Innovation Committee, responsible for establishing the strategy, validating all projects relating to products that are carried out in the 15 Fluidra Centres of Excellence and technical centres, and defining the corporate "Guidelines" intended to serve as a guide for all Centres in the process of product development. A total of 109 people spend on average 50% of their time working on product R&D.

In order to streamline resources and allow each unit to focus on its specific part of the business, Fluidra offers shared services from its headquarters in Sabadell

SALES and logistics

With production centres spread across all continents and its ample marketing capabilities, Fluidra's capillarity is ideally poised to progressively increase its market share. The company has a specialised distribution network for the different business units with a direct presence in 45 countries with 128 subsidiaries and branches, which employ more than 1,350 professionals.
In Spain, the logistic model is based on regional branches (cash & carry) with stock only for those items with higher turnover and deliverability in short periods of time for the other items. As a result of its commitment to efficiency, the company has an innovative automated logistics operator with a surface area of 55,000 sqm and a capacity to dispatch 150,000 pallets annually and carry out 20,000 daily box collections.

Services and management
The last link in Fluidra's value chain is the provision of management services and functions both with regard to Group companies and also to customers and end users services so that in this way it may come full circle in the water business.
In order to optimise the Group's resources and allow each unit to focus on its specific part of the business, Fluidra offers shared services to centralise accounting and finance duties through the Shared Service Centre, as well as providing legal and tax services, marketing, auditing and human resources from the headquarters in Sabadell (Barcelona).
The company offers customers:
· After-sales technical assistance. Fluidra's after-sales technical support service offers solutions and answers questions on installation, maintenance or repairs. In high season it is reinforced by a call centre for both customers and end users.
· Customer training. With the advances of innovations and the increasing automation and complexity of the industry, Fluidra has, since 2012, a Customers Training Plan which organises training sessions for customers worldwide on an annual basis.

In addition to the aforementioned stakeholders, the company maintains constant and stable relations with other groups that are also important to the Group, such as:
· Domestic and international analysts and investors, through participation in roadshows, conferences and meetings.
· The media, through regular mailings of news (press releases), meetings and interviews.
· Business schools, through the development of case studies on Fluidra.
· The academic world in general, by receiving visits by groups of students from different countries that are interested in Fluidra's track-record.
· End users, through the AstralPool website with an online pool-configuration simulator. Simulations for calculating energy savings can be performed thanks to this tool by selecting different parameters such as: country, climate, swimming pool measures, etc.
· Public administrations and government bodies, Fluidra participates as a member in the Committees of Sustainability and Environment, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Prosecutors of the Chamber of Commerce of Barcelona, and it is also actively involved in the meetings on Administrative Simplification of the Regional Government of Catalonia.
A cross-channel for all stakeholders is the opinion poll on the Integrated Report of the company. Two proposals in relation to the contents of the report were received through this channel: to incorporate direct feedback from customers (which has been taking place since 2014) and increased coverage of information, which is fulfilled in this report (see section About of the report) and which has plans to expand year after year until it reaches 100%.
No key issues or problems were raised as unresolved or requiring attention during the dialogue between the company and the various stakeholders throughout the year.

No key issues or problems were raised as unresolved or requiring attention during the dialogue with stakeholders in 2016

How Fluidra is perceived from the outside
In response to the 2016 Reporta Report, which analyses the quality of information and of the reporting of those companies listed on the Spanish continuous market, Fluidra continues to climb positions in the ranking of assessment reports.
In the last report, Fluidra entered the Top 10, ranking eighth, becoming once again the top company in terms of reporting quality outside Ibex-35, improving its score by 6.9 points, which allowed it to climb 14 positions.

In 2016, we exceeded the expectations set in our strategic plan and the forecast for 2017 suggests that we will meet our targets for 2018 a year earlier than expected"

The world is going through a period of great uncertainty marked by many changes: the UK decided to leave the European Union; there is a new president in the United States; and Europe has major upcoming elections in key countries in 2017.
Alongside these geopolitical movements, global GDP growth forecasts for 2017 are lower than those achieved in 2016. The first IMF estimates indicate a global growth of 3.4%, where advanced economies would grow an average of 1.8%; emerging and developed economies are up by 4.5%; and underdeveloped countries would post 4.9% growth. In this context, the IMF estimates of GDP growth for Spain in 2017 stands at 2.3%, somewhat lower than the GDP growth for 2016, estimated at the end of this report at 3.2%.
One of the main reasons for the slowdown in 2017 is China. The country was used to double-digit GDP growth supported by a growing investment of up to 50% of GDP and a heavy industry that monopolises the bulk of global markets, both which are unable to absorb the production of the Asian giant. This shift towards a GDP based on domestic consumption has already begun. In this context, the IMF expects China's GDP growth to stand at 6.2% for 2017.

All leading indicators confirm the good performance of the Spanish economy and predict a positive 2017

Another economically troubled front is the price of oil, influenced by the agreements made in an OPEC sector and the instability recorded in another one.
Outlook in Spain
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) continues to rely on the Spanish economy and the forecast launched in the last quarter of 2016; Spain is still the fastest growing economy in the entire Eurozone. After a year of political uncertainty, Spain has managed to form a government and the agreements are expected to materialise soon, both in terms of budgetary and deficit control to meet the requirements of the European Union, as in the measures to create jobs and maintain attractive and sustainable levels of future GDP growth.
The set of leading indicators confirms the good performance of the Spanish economy and predicts a positive 2017: the number of members of Social Security and private consumption is on the rise, the price index of commodities is also positive, car sales and new mortgages have gone up and bank lending to households is increasingly growing.
Uncertainties in Europe and in the US
The hike in economic activity in the whole of the European Union has been positive, while Italy generated some uncertainty: the results of the referendum and the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mateo Renzi, which can translate into a few months of high volatility, compounded by negotiations between Britain and the European Union for the quick implementation of Brexit.
Besides the impact these facts may have on the stock market, the region will be keeping an eye on inflation, employment levels, the price of oil, the rise of populism in both ideologies, terrorist threats, immigration and international geopolitical unrest. In this scenario, the implementation of the European Central Bank policy should serve to calm down the stock markets in both Europe and other international markets.
In early 2017, the United States became an unknown player, as expectation rises to see how President Donald Trump runs and implements his policies and how they will affect global growth.

Disparity in emerging markets
Despite an apparent slowdown, the structural reforms the government is implementing in China to modernise the economy point towards a positive trend. Also within the Asian context, India continues to grow at rates of around 7%, supported by its dynamic private consumption and increased government spending which offset the decline in investment.
Across the Pacific, Brazil seems to start finding its way out of recession. Leading indicators are positive, but too low to attract investor confidence towards the Latin American country again.

Strategic 4.2 priorities
Fluidra presented its 2018 Strategic Plan in 2015, which is its roadmap for profitable growth.
The construction of new pools in 2015 reached a turning point after several years of decline originated with the onset of the 2008 crisis, while forecasts pointed to a gradual improvement. In 2016, the number of existing pools in the world was approaching 15.6 million and the number of new pools grew approximately 330,000, which attests to the recovery of the sector.
Fluidra's business model allows it to benefit from recurring revenues from the existing pool park, as well as from the recovery of newly built pools. The company estimates that 70% of the business is related with the maintenance and care of the pool park and the remaining 30% with new construction. The group's international expansion has made it possible to develop a network covering almost all of the world's park pools, excluding the United States.
The 2018 Strategic Plan consists of three main pillars: focus, penetration and best practices. Fluidra has placed its focus on the Pool & Wellness sector, it has increased its market penetration through its international subsidiaries and it has implemented best practices in key areas such as sales, manufacturing and logistics in all countries where it operates.

Focusing on Pool & Wellness allows Fluidra to strengthen its position as sector leader worldwide. Fluidra's strategy is to deploy its business model and product policy internationally to meet the demand of each market. This represents, for both residential and commercial swimming pools, the introduction of new, more efficient products which provide added value to the user, with a clear commitment to innovation.
Fluidra will concentrate its efforts on deeper penetration in markets where it already has a presence. The goal is to gain market share using the company's extensive product portfolio.
The company identified six Best Practices within the organisation, in key areas which are being transferred to all countries where it already operates and to all business areas of the company.

Best Practices in 2016

Professional management of the customer portfolio.
Evolution in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Singapore, Thailand, United Kingdom and
Austria.

Continuing the consolidation of
the sector.
Acquisitions of Sibo, EGT Aqua and Somhidros

Expanding the implementation of the Cash & Carry business model.
Implementation of the model in Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Hungary

through Lean Manufacturing to achieve a maximum level of excellence.
Implementation of the model in Italy, Australia and South
Africa.

Achieving a more effective and efficient logistic model.
Implementation of the model in Italy, Australia and South Africa.

Priorities and financial 4.3 objectives
Fluidra's financial forecasts indicate that the achievement of objectives of the 2018 Strategic Plan could be brought forward by one year. The turnover of EUR 713 million and the growth achieved place Fluidra closer to the target set for 2018. In addition, this higher volume is making it possible to reach higher EBITDA levels, which also bring the company closer to achieving the plan's targets. The ratios of working capital use are already better than those established for 2018, which proves the rigour employed in the company's capital management. These indicators forecast that Fluidra can anticipate by one year the achievement of the 2018 Strategic Plan.
Fluidra expects to continue with its profitable growth which combines organic and inorganic growth, maintaining financial strength of the group with net debt below 2x EBITDA, providing a payout to shareholders of around 50%.

INVICTUS PROJECT
The INVICTUS Project, which began in 2014, is a new operational model which aims to align all Fluidra processes with a global perspective and focus its efforts on tasks that add value. The aim of the project is to continue competing at the highest level in an increasingly demanding multinational environment, and be the best option for customers, exceeding their expectations. INVICTUS'keys to achieve the above are process standardisation, Information Technology system integration and the creation of a common database for the whole company.
During 2016, INVICTUS had three major progresses: start of activies in the first sales company (Fluidra Portugal), in the first manufacturing company (Metalast) and the creation and start of activities of Fluidra Global Distribution.

Fluidra Global Distribution
The mission of Fluidra Global Distribution is to centralise into a single location the purchase and supply of commercial enterprises, both for third-party suppliers and own factories of the group, with the aim of providing a better service to customers and becoming their best choice, through simplifying the model, standardising processes and improving stock control, the order book and commercial assistance provided.

Future 4.4 outlook
The new CSR Master Plan proposes 32 goals, 54 measures and 60 actions, all to be developed between 2017 and 2020
2017-2020 CSR Master Plan
In 2016, we worked on defining the new CSR Master Plan with 2020 as a deadline, thus aligned with the Corporate Strategic Plan. The new CSR Master Plan establishes two general objectives on which all actions planned are managed:
1
To position Fluidra as a leading Spanish business group through value creation on the basis of CSR.
2
To achieve the ability to successfully meet the sustainability requirements set out in international stock indexes like the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
37

Main figures for 2016 Business model

Letter from the President Strategy 2016

To achieve these objectives, and following the structure defined by the Sustainability Excellence Club, six strategic work dimensions have been defined:

Strategic dimensions
CSR management
Internal social dimension

Stakeholders and communication

External social dimension

Ethics, compliance and corporate governance

Environmental dimension

All goals and actions defined in the plan are aimed towards the consolidation of existing CSR structures and to complete anything that may be missing to achieve the objectives.
The 6 dimensions are broken down into 32 goals, 54 measures and 60 actions, all to be developed between 2017 and 2020
The actions planned to be developed between 2017 and 2020 are, among others: implementing a CSR training and awareness plan for all employees, creating and developing the Social Action and Patronage Master Plan aligned with the goals of the United Nations, the Customer Centric Plan, applying the technological innovation in customer relationships, developing a corporate volunteer programme, drafting Equality and Corporate Diversity plans, implementing the OHSAS 18001 / ISO 45001 and ISO 50001 on energy management and the implementation of the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), and setting short-term goals, or in the field of ethics and compliance, designing a reporting on taxes paid in the countries in which it operates.

Our process of reviewing and updating regulations allows us to adapt quickly to the recommendations of best practices in terms of good governanceo"

Fluidra's governing bodies are the General Shareholders'Meeting and the Board of Directors which, in turn, have established the following Governance Committees: Appointments and Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Delegate Committee.
The Articles of Association, Regulations (of the General Meeting and the Board), and other internal rules and procedures make up the regulatory body that governs Fluidra's corporate governance system. The company ensures compliance with the recommendations and international best practices regarding governance, which is why it continuously reviews and updates its rules and regulations.
Fluidra adopts and publishes the Annual Corporate Governance Report which is governed by the recommendations on corporate governance of listed companies. This document has been available on the corporate website since its adoption.
In addition to the governing bodies described above, Fluidra has a governance structure for the management of the company which consists of the Corporate Committee, in charge of the Group's day-to-day business, and the G30, an expanded executive committee with the presence of all geography area managers, the production centres and the cross-sectional corporate functions.
The Sales and Operations General Manager and the Corporate General Manager attend all Board meetings, and channel and convey to that body any issues that may be identified as relevant to the Group.

Furthermore, as of 21 January 2016 the Board of Directors approved the appointment by co-option of Dispur, S.L., as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company as nominee director to fill the vacancy which, with effect from 31 December 2015, was left due to the resignation of director Mr. Juan Planes Vila. At the same event, Dispur, S.L. accepted the position and appointed Ms. Eulàlia Planes Corts as the individual representing the company to exercise the position.
The appointment by co-option of Dispur, S.L. as a Director of Fluidra, S.A. was subject to ratification by the Ordinary General Meeting which took place on 3 May 2016, and by the Board of Directors of the Company, which approved said ratification.
According to the provisions in Articles 17 and 18 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, Directors are appointed by the General Meeting or, where appropriate, by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act. In any case, for each appointment there must be (i) a previous proposal of the Appointments and Compensation Committee in the case of independent directors, or (ii) a preliminary report of the Appointments and Compensation Committee in the case of other type of directors. The appointment must be accompanied, in any case, by a Board report supporting the competence, experience and merits of the candidate, which shall be attached to the minutes of the General Meeting or the Board itself.
In the case of natural persons who are designated representatives of legal persons, the proposed natural person representative shall submit the report of the Appointments and Compensation Committee.
When appointing of a new director, the candidate must take the direction programme for new directors established by the Company, so that he/she can acquire a rapid and sufficient knowledge of the Company and its corporate governance rules.
The Board of Directors ensures that the candidates are persons of recognised standing, competence and experience, taking extreme care in the choice of those candidates who are to cover the positions
of independent directors. [G 4 - 4 0 ]

The Board of Directors met on 21 January 2016 and appointed Dispur, S.L. as company Director; the former is represented on the Board by Ms. Eulàlia Planes Corts, the first female member of the Board of Directors of Fluidra.
Directors' performance review
In accordance with the provisions contained in Article 14 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Appointments and Compensation Committee is to assess the skills, expertise and experience required of candidates to join the Board and will therefore define the roles and capabilities required to fill each vacancy.

Governance Report for that financial year in sections C.1.19, C.1.20 and C.1.20bis. [G 4 - 4 4 ]

The Delegate Committee consists of the Executive Director, three nominee directors and one independent director. Similarly, a nominee director is the non-Board-member Secretary of the Delegate Committee. The composition of the Delegate Committee reflects the composition of the Board, and the balance established thereof between executive, nominee and independent directors.

Remuneration policy
[G4-51, G4-52, G4-53, G4-54, G4-55]
The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors consists of a fixed annual remuneration and an allowance for attending Board of Directors meetings.
There is also an additional remuneration for those Directors who are part of any of the Board Committees, namely the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and the Appointments and Compensation Committee.
The maximum remuneration amount that Fluidra can provide its Directors for such items is determined by the General Shareholders' Meeting, under the condition that the amount is a reflection of the effective professional performance of the same and of the benchmark with the market. A benchmark study on the remuneration of Fluidra's directors compared to the Spanish market to objectify their compensation took place in 2016.
In compliance with the international recommendations of Good Corporate Governance (proxy advisors), in 2012, it was decided to dissociate the remuneration of the Board from the performance of the organisation through variable remuneration, so there is currently no variable concept in the
remuneration structure of the Board [G 4 - 5 2 ] , except the Executive President, who, together with his
management team, have part of their remuneration linked to various economic performance indicators, and also to the strategic management objectives of company. (For additional information see p. 23 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors).
Annually, the Annual Report on remuneration of directors is subjected to a vote of the General Shareholders' Meeting; this report includes information about the remuneration policy of the Company for the current year and for future years, a comprehensive summary on how the remuneration policy was applied during the previous financial year and the breakdown of the individual remunerations earned by each of the directors.
In the last General Shareholders' Meeting held on 3 May 2016, the item on the agenda concerning the advisory vote of the aforementioned Annual Report on remuneration of directors (Item 5) was adopted with 88,622,517 votes in favour, that is, 99.9995% of the votes, representing 78.6857% of the share capital.
[G4-53]
As for the wage gap between the highest paid member in the group (Executive President) and the average of the workforce in 2016, a ratio of 15 times was established. Wage increases in the group are set annually
based on performance evaluation of individuals. [G 4 - 5 4 , G 4 - 5 5 ]

Ethical framework

5.3

[G4-DMA, G4-56, G4-57, G4-58 ]

There are two pillars which support ethical management in the organisation of Fluidra group: the Code of Ethics, entitled People Values, and the Code of Ethics for Suppliers. The first inspires and defines the day to day conduct of all employees of Fluidra and the second works as guidelines for social responsibility and sustainability in the supply chain.
People Values
The Code of Ethics is a reflection of the values and principles that should guide the conduct of all companies which belong to the Fluidra group. The Code of Ethics was created by Fluidra in 2008 and was last updated in 2015.
Its implementation is binding on all persons and directors of the Fluidra Group, regardless of the position or role they hold (including administrative bodies, managerial positions and other supervisory bodies), ensuring a responsible ethical behaviour and compliance with the law.
The Code of Ethics does not replace or abrogate the existing legislation in each country or at the international level, whether in terms of administrative, civil, criminal, labour or commercial law, or the internal company regulations or binding collective agreements.
Fluidra encourages all its members to consult with their supervisors, or with the Committee set up to promote the use of the Code of Ethics or through the Confidential Channel, on any situation in which they may have questions about whether their own actions or that of third parties could infringe the ethical principles established.

Letter from the President Strategy 2016

So that the `People Values' Code of Ethics is not just a mere declaration of intent, there are several mechanisms that disseminate, promote and ensure its implementation and enforcement, namely: the Ethics Committee, the Confidential Channel, a training activity and a disciplinary system when failing to comply with the law and ethical principles.
Ethics Committee
The Ethics Committee consists of the Human Resources, Internal Audit and Legal divisions. The Ethics Committee receives, examines and responds to inquiries, complaints or allegations raised by employees, customers, suppliers or others. All requests or communications regarding incidents are handled with confidentiality and respect for all parties involved.
The Ethics Committee reports to the Audit Committee, the governing body reporting directly to the Board of Directors.
C o n f i d e n t i a l C h a n n e l [G4-58]
The Confidential Channel is available on the corporate website, at Fluidra's intranet in the Living Fluidra section and by email at peoplevalues@fluidra.com, which is available to all employees, customers, suppliers or other stakeholders. Through an online form or via email they can make inquires, ask for advice or report an incident.
All communications are handled confidentially and care is taken when making any decision always respecting the people involved.
In 2016, nine queries were recorded through this channel. Once examined and evaluated, they did not lead to complaints on human rights violations, corruption or
discrimination. [G 4 - H R 3 . G 4 - H R 1 2 , G 4 - S O 5 ]
There have not been any cases of violation of the rights of indigenous peoples.
[G4-HR8]
Training
Fluidra conveys its `People Values' Code of Ethics to all employees through a compulsory online training course, or attending training sessions where a physical copy of the document is handed out. The aim of this courses is to inform all employees about Fluidra's values and reflect on the importance of ethical standards that will help them in the development of their daily activities.
In addition, as permanent support for dissemination and clarification of doubts, a number of posters have been created and hung in several of the group's facilities. They also created several links that lead directly to the Code of Ethics or the Confidential Channel, both from the corporate website www.fluidra.com, como desde el portal de noticias www.livingfluidra.fluidra.com and from the intranet.

Suppliers' Code of Ethics
The actions of suppliers and providers of materials operating outside the scope of the group's internal control are monitored by Fluidra. To this end, Fluidra has implemented a Supplier Code of Ethics since 2011 which is specific to its supply chain.
The provisions of this Code are present in the approval process of new suppliers, their membership is automatically implemented by the general clauses in all corporate agreements.
For those cases where there is no explicit agreement, an informative clause in the ordering system was included in 2015. In addition, a specific section containing the Supplier Code of Ethics has been created on Fluidra's website. Thus, any supplier can check it at any time, even before starting a commercial relationship with Fluidra.
Fluidra is aware that in addition to the commitment made by suppliers, it is necessary to implement control measures. In this sense, Fluidra is working to establish during next year protocols for action and appropriate follow-up to the high variability and types of providers.

Compliance
Fluidra has spent several years developing a Corporate Compliance Programme whose main objective is to generate an ethical culture within the company and prevent any violation of the law, especially any such which may be classified under the Criminal Code or under applicable law at any given time and place.
Furthermore, the Corporate Compliance Programme contains the roles appearing in the Ethical Framework section of this report, with some other important roles worth noting:
· Compliance Coordinating Committee: This committee is composed of the Sales and Operations General Manager and by Human Resources, Internal Audit, and Legal Counsel representatives. Its main functions are: (I) to ensure that the Compliance Programme is properly developed, (ii) to promote the development of policy standards and procedures, (iii) to collaborate on any necessary research to support the Ethics Committee.
· Policies, rules and procedures: It refers to the regulatory body that defines and specifies the lines of conduct to be taken by employees of Fluidra Group. The group is developing new policies, rules or procedures that apply to all workers. A section on the intranet called "Policies and Procedures" has also been created. It contains all regulations that employees must follow.
· Training plan: Fluidra is developing a training plan to ensure that all employees are given sufficient training in all areas applicable to them, especially in relation to those areas where there is a greater risk of committing crimes.
Programme implementation
Fluidra has developed an implementation plan of the Corporate Compliance Programme in the different group companies. The implementation shall be performed gradually, in stages and levels. The implementation plan will begin in Spain, Australia, the USA, France and the UK throughout 2017.
External validation
In September 2016, an external auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers) issued an expert report certifying that Fluidra S.A. has a reasonable control environment to prevent crimes which imply criminal liability to the legal person. That is, Fluidra has a Corporate Compliance programme.

Risk management

5.4

[G4-14, G4-44, G4-45, G4-46, G4-47]

The efficient management of potential risks is essential for proper development, achieving objectives and the future plan of any company. Fluidra, as an international industrial group, understands that corporate risk management is one of the cornerstones of its business.
Corporate risk management falls to the Audit Committee as an advisory body and as representative of the Board of Directors.
The Risk Management System works in a comprehensive and continuous manner, consolidating such management through subsidiaries, geographical areas and supplementing it with corporate support areas. It includes the identification, analysis, assessment ­ both by activity and by the current environment ­, controls and associated mitigation plans.
The duties of the Audit Committee regarding Risk Management include:
· Identifying the different types of risk (strategic, operational, financial, legal, reputational and accidental), including ­among financial and economic risks­ contingent liabilities and other off-balance risks.
· Identifying the measures in place to mitigate the impact of identified risks, should they materialise.
· Verifying and monitoring the Corporate Risk Map as a tool to identify, manage and follow up on risks with significant impact on the Group's objectives.
The different risks are identified and assessed based on an analysis of the events that may trigger them. The assessment is performed using metrics that calculate likelihood and impact. Existing controls are put in place in order to mitigate such risks and any additional necessary action plans are implemented if the above controls are deemed insufficient. Through this process, which is conducted annually and coordinated by Internal Audit, the Company's Risk Map may be outlined. The map provides the most significant risks, along with the main variations from the previous year, which are then presented to the Audit Committee for discussion and approval.

The analysis of risks, controls and actions to mitigate their impact and probability is presented annually to the Audit Committee for supervision and approval

61

Main figures for 2016 Business model
Corporate Governance Annexes

Letter from the President Strategy 2016

The definition of the scale of severity and the scale of likelihood is performed according to qualitative and quantitative criteria. Once critical risks are identified and reassessed, the Company's senior management officers devise specific measures, appointing those in charge of their implementation as well as the time frames allocated, so as to mitigate the risks' impact and likelihood, while reviewing the current controls in place on such risks.
The analysis of risks, controls and measures to mitigate their impact and likelihood is presented annually to the Audit Committee for supervision and approval. Subsequently, the Audit Committee reports the above to the Board of Directors.
Risks that materialised in 2016

Failure to comply with expectations in the US market. In 2011, Fluidra acquired Aqua group, a leading company in the world of robotic pool-cleaners with presence in the US and Israeli market. Growth forecasts and penetration in the US market have not reached the levels initially expected. Likewise, the value in use of the cash-generating unit resulting from the acquisition of Aqua group does not cover the value of the net assets and goodwill assigned, so an impairment in the Goodwill resulting from the purchase ensued reducing it to EUR 1.5 million.
Referendum on the membership to the European Union held in the UK. Following the outcome of the referendum on the membership to the European Union held in the UK on 23 June 2016, there have been immediate consequences such as the devaluation of the pound sterling. Although we find that Fluidra's operations in the UK have grown at double-digit in local currency, there is a drop in sales value and investments (assets and liabilities) when consolidated in EUR, while no significant impact has been observed at the moment thanks to the actions taken by Fluidra's Management team. The company continues to monitor both the UK's economy and the market and competitors to act in an appropriate manner given the current uncertainties.

Table of main risks I [G4-45]
Monitoring of and response plans for Fluidra's main risks.

Development of new products.
Continuous analysis of sales of new strategic products and its comparison with that of competitors based on monitoring tools for market research, analysis of statistical databases by market and by product type. Conducting comparative studies to set themselves apart from the competition and updating the assessment dossiers of products with the information obtained. Specific action plans aimed at ensuring the adaptation of production capabilities to anticipate levels of demand for these new products.
Financial risks.
Financial risks are subject to continuous monitoring for exposure to exchange rate risk or interest rate risk, among others, and policies and measures are suggested in this respect.

Credit risks.
The Fluidra Group has a highly diversified portfolio of domestic and international clients, in which there is not one top customer that represents a significant percentage of the turnover of the year, so credit risk is also mitigated.
Technological risks.
Given the activities carried out by the various business units of Fluidra, protecting technology and development is key to maintaining its competitive edge. To this end, the company has criteria and development policies in place together with legal protocols that ensure protection.

Table of main risks II [ G4-45]
Subsidiaries management risk.
Fluidra is certain that bolstering and standardising the procedures and internal controls in the Group's subsidiaries is the way forward for early detection and eradication of irregularities in the management of subsidiaries. In this respect, the INVICTUS project is a valuable tool for achieving this goal.
Implementation of new business activities.
Continuous assessment of new activities and organisation by Fluidra, which add more value to the group, culminated in 2016 with the acquisition and integration Sibo in the Netherlands. Aware that any new activity involves an inherent risk, the company hired specialised external consultants who provided advice on the procurement processes and Fluidra has established the necessary controls to mitigate the risk associated with the development and integration of any new activity.

Human capital risks.
Fluidra group companies have a variable remuneration policy linked to professional development and the achievement of personal goals so as to be able to identify and reward its best employees. The parent company has a reporting channel created by the Audit Committee under the collegial management of the corporate management of Human Resources, Internal Audit and the Legal department, so that any employee of the group can file a complaint about issues related to internal control, accounting or auditing. The company has an Internal Code of Conduct in place for matters relating to the stock market.
Risks relating to processes.
These risks are managed and monitored centrally by the Management and Control Department and verified by the Internal Audit Department. The processes of obtaining the consolidated economic and financial information are developed centrally and under corporate criteria, with the Financial Statement, both consolidated and individual, from the corresponding subsidiary, verified by external auditors.

Economic performance

The Fluidra Group has a turnover at year-end 2016 of EUR 713.3 million with a growth of 10.2% over the previous year (+ 12.6% at constant exchange rates). The evolution of the turnover has been very positive on European markets, although it has been affected by the devaluation of the pound sterling. In the rest of the world, growth has also been remarkable, slowed only by China and supported by the acquisition of Waterlinx in South Africa, by the sales growth in the US and the strong performance in Australia.
By business areas, the main player of the good performance of the figures is residential pool, which has increased in sales by 16.4%, together with 13.6% of the water treatment family.
To contextualise the sales figures, we must take into account three events occurred during the year: the impact of Waterlinx, acquired in July 2015; the acquisition of Sibo in 2016, which has contributed EUR 7.5 million ; and disinvestment in November 2016 in Calderería Plástica del Norte, whose sales in December 2015 stood at EUR 0.2 million.

EBITDA totalled EUR 86 million in 2016, a figure 19.1% higher than the previous year, on the back of higher net sales and a higher gross margin. The improvement in EBITDA reflects a net profit attributable to the main company of EUR 24.1 million, almost double the EUR 13 million of 2015, which represents 3.4% on sales.
In 2016 investment in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted, compared to 2015, by EUR 2.4 million , reaching a total of EUR 29.2 million. The growth is mainly due to an industrial reorganisation process launched in Australia and South Africa, as well as the implementation costs and licenses of the Invictus Project.

Financial situation
Net financial debt (NFD) decreased by 3.5%, going from EUR 162.3 million to EUR 156.6 million due to cash flow generation from operations, which financed disbursements

Credit institutions are the main source of funding for Fluidra. In 2015, the company signed a new syndicated financing agreement worth EUR 210 million, with a duration of 5 years. The operation consists of a loan tranche worth EUR 155 million, with an average life of 4.125 years and a revolving credit line of EUR 55 million, for 5 years. This agreement made it possible to cancel a previous loan and led to a reduction in financial costs by over 50%. At year-end 2016, the outstanding capital on the loan tranche was EUR 147.25 million.
Capital grants for 2016 were of EUR 18,902, and no tax incentives were implemented.

Pool & Wellness
®

The Best Practices and the various acquisitions made during the year have strengthened Fluidra's leadership in the swimming pool industry, while opening some doors in specific segments such as natural pools and wooden facilities.
Fluidra continues to promote technological developments in the industry, especially with regard to the "internet of things", a concept which has been talked about for quite some time now. Currently, thanks to Fluidra, this idea has entered the world of pools with the introduction of the Internet of Pools. With the aim to adapt to a constantly evolving demand and covering all the needs of its customers globally, Fluidra has three solutions to control a pool remot:
· Fluidra Connect
The company has designed Fluidra Connect, a platform which enables remote control on the operation of all components involved in the maintenance of the pool: from the filtration system to lighting, from HVAC to chemical water treatment. Fluidra Connect works through a Wi-Fi connection to the internet and through the Connect Box device. The platform allows the user to check from their computer, tablet or smartphone all parameters and control data of the system, including control of outdoor lighting and watering. Thanks to the installation of Fluidra Connect, water and energy management becomes more efficient. This information is presented in a simple manner, with graphs and reports, highlighting any issues or indicator to be considered.
· Viron Connect
Viron Connect is the pool equivalent of what automation is to modern homes. The solution, focused on the Australian and US markets, consists of an LCD touch screen that allows the whole family to use the pool and spa at any time and in any condition, whatever the characteristics of the installation. It also has

a special feature that allows you to download the mobile app"Connect My Pool"to enable remote control of the pool anywhere in the world.
· Poolstation
It is an automation platform that enables easy and intuitive control of all functions of the elements of the pool and the garden. It is a product aimed at both professionals and regular users, it works with landline and mobile devices.
Commercial Pool: Engineering projects
In 2016 Fluidra signed, among many other installation projects, two projects with which it strengthens its presence in Asia and its commitment to growth in Commercial Pool through the sale of engineering solutions, one of the growth drivers of the Strategic Plan.
Fluidra won the tender for the design, supply and installation of the Olympic and training swimming pool for the 29th Summer Universiade championships to be held in Taipei (Taiwan) from 19 to 30 August 2017. The contract amounts to EUR 5.1 million and once the competition is over, both pools will be re-installed in their final location, in the south of Taiwan.
It has also been chosen to install the pools of the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta in the renovation project of the Gelora Bung Karno sports facilities. The project, whose contract is worth EUR 4 million, includes the installation of four pools to be used for the water sports of the games in the Indonesian capital: competition pool, water polo pool, diving pool and training pool.

Irrigation and household water treatment

Aware that water is a valuable and scarce resource, Fluidra promotes efficient irrigation systems, thus avoiding water waste and integrating sustainable use.
Electro valves and controllers to manage irrigation and flow control are extremely efficient tools. Fluidra offers a full range of products consisting of sprinklers, diffusers, valves, pipes, filters, and so on, in addition to drip-irrigation and micro-irrigation systems used where water use is to be kept to a minimum.
Fluidra complements its Pool & Wellness core business with the provision of services, simultaneously in many cases, in the field of landscape irrigation as the facilities can be next to each other. In this market, Fluidra remains an international distributor of top brands, but is increasingly working on setting up its own brand (Cepex) with all the necessary products for residential installations, looking for new products and working with top manufacturers.
This year, Fluidra began introducing new technological solutions for irrigation control in the international market, creating a solution that did not exist in this market.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR and future challenges

During financial year 2016, Fluidra's share maintained a very positive performance staying away from the underlying market trends. Following the publication of the year-end results in late February 2015, the shares rocketed in the stock market marking a clear trend for the whole year. At the end of May, coinciding with the celebration of MedCap Forum organised by BME in Madrid, the shares posted new highs in the stock market reaching a verticality that far from scaring investors, led them to trust even more in the growth potential of Fluidra.
The share price suffered ups and downs throughout the year, both on the back of the news and the results published by the company, and the contagious effect of the general stock market movements and the markets in general. However, the level of EUR 4 per share underwent a strong consolidation. At year-end, as a result of a particular transaction of an investor, the share price dropped during several sessions, but quickly regained and exceed the level of EUR 4 per share.
Analysts took advantage of that slight fall to reiterate their commitment to Fluidra, as by institutional investors who saw a new opportunity to enter and increase their positions on the shares.
The market as a whole generally appreciates the efforts made in the past by Fluidra to recover any drops in profitability as a result of the negative European environment. In financial year 2016, Fluidra's figures built trust for investors in the path ahead and the increases in share prices and contracting volume are the

During 2016, within the framework of a complicated

result of this trust. In addition, the fact of anticipating to achieve the targets set in the 2018 Strategic Plan in advance make the market rely on higher returns in the future and consider the possibility of investments and acquisitions of greater significance, as soon as Fluidra increases both its sale volume and efficiency and profitability ratios.
At year-end, the price of Fluidra's shares came to EUR 4.32 per unit, which represents a cumulative rise for of 38.02% in the year. The volume of shares traded during 2016 was 59.34% higher than the volume traded in 2015.

Investor relations

Investor relations maintained by Fluidra throughout the year were very intense, helping market value insight to be more deep, transparent and based on the true and fair view of the company, maintaining trust in the performance and development of Fluidra, while generating high expectations in the medium term.
Activity volumes from Investor Relations management in 2016 were higher than in previous years:
1. Financial analysts, including domestic and international ones, covering Fluidra's value represent a total of 17 between buy-side and sell-side analysts. This figure is clearly related to the good performance of Fluidra's value on the Spanish trading floor. A figure which, at the same time, is much higher than that of other listed companies that for various reasons do not have such a high number of active analysts.
2. Individual meetings, presentations to institutional investors (investment funds and pension funds, insurance companies and credit institutions) and participation in forums, seminars and conferences organised bybuy-side and sell-side investment banks have increased by 33.5% compared to 2015. In the whole of 2016, the company arranged a total of 657 meetings with investors and 25 national and international roadshows, 19% more roadshows than in 2015.
The intense communication activity carried out by the division Investor Relations has fostered the participation of institutional investors in numerous seminars and forums, giving greater visibility to our activities and expanding recurrence and the basis for our communication. In many of them, Fluidra was one of the Top 10 companies with the highest number of meeting requests. This ensures our participation in these seminars and forums in future.

Activities for shareholders and investors

Shareholder's Day
Continuing along our the lines of transparency and communication with our stakeholders, during 2016, the eight consecutive Fluidra Retail Shareholders'Day was held. The Executive President, the Corporate General Manager and the Head of Investor and Shareholder Relations told the shareholders in attendance of various aspects of interest both regarding the Fluidra Group and the macroeconomic and financial situation at the time. At this event, the different concerns and expectations were discussed in a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Thanks to this type of events, Fluidra builds value between individual shareholders and the group. Throughout the day, the shareholders shared with the CEO their views on business progress, company strategy and market trends, and also expressed their own concerns and opinions through open dialogue.

General Shareholders' Meeting
As usual, the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting of Fluidra was held on 03 May 2016 at the premises of the Sabadell Chamber of Commerce. The Board approved all items on the agenda, and everything went smoothly.

Among the items on the agenda, the approval of the 2015 financial statement was included. Since the results were positive that year, the Board agreed to distribute 77% of consolidated profit in dividends, with an absolute figure of EUR 10 million as dividend.
With this type of event, Fluidra brings the reality of the group and its business closer to the small investor through proximity actions between shareholders and senior management. These events are very important given the strategic development which Fluidra is undergoing. From the Investor Relations Department, all shareholders, current or potential, matter regardless of their size.

Sourcing and retaining talent has become, due to an increasingly competitive labour and business environment, a key asset within any company. At this moment of positive developments within Fluidra, it is essential to develop human resources policies that bolster the business and add value to it, while meeting the training and development needs of people within the organisation, seeking mainly to strengthen the initiative and fostering the creativity of our team in order to successfully carry out Fluidra's projects.
It is worth mentioning the Group's effort to maintain the level of quality employment, with a high percentage of staff with permanent contracts. In 2016, the percentage of permanent staff was still 93% of the aggregate workforce according to the report. Fluidra continues to prioritise the hiring of staff based locally with regard to the geographical areas where the workplaces are located.
In 2016, organisational changes to further adapt the organisational structure of the workforce to the growth strategy under the 2018 Strategic Plan were implemented. Part of the sales growth plan comes from acquisitions. Halfway through 2016, a company in northern Europe called SIBO was acquired, based in the Netherlands. Moreover, at

the end of 2016 there was a divestment with the sale of the company Calderería Plástica del Norte.
The overall number of Fluidra employees greatly increased to a total of 4,273 employees at the end of 2016, with an average workforce of 4,336.
At year-end, the total number of company employees included in this report was 2,400, of which 68% are men and 32% women. The average age of Fluidra's workforce is close to 41 years of age. The age range with the largest number of employees is 30-45, representing 53% of the total.
[G4-LA1]
There were a total of 328 staff redundancies throughout the year according to the report, of which 16.5 % were people over 45 years of age (of whom 22.2 % are women). In 2016, the rate of structural rotation (permanent staff ), including amortised and unamortised redundancies, stood at 4.7%, significantly lower than last year, which indicates that the company is
growing in terms of employment. [G 4 - L A 1 ]
As for the minimum periods of notice for operational changes, there is no specific agreement with workers thus current legislation is applicable
in each centre. [G 4 - L A 4 ]
Organisational Structure
In order to adapt the organisation to the growth targeted by the company, during 2016 the so-called G-30 governing body remained operational. This body consists of key directors who implement the 2018 Strategic Plan.
When analysing the age pyramid of our staff we see that the group Millennials represents 11.6 % of the total. This group compels us to rethink our policies to further adapt them to the interests and expectations of the group.
Remuneration policy
In 2016, the alignment of the remuneration system for the group of managers called G-100 began, incorporating the overall results of the group within the annual incentives system.
The management policy by salary level, which helps improve internal equity and wage external competitiveness for remuneration matters, continued to be implemented. For yet another year, the minimum wage of newly recruited staff stood at around 30% above the minimum wage set for Spain in 2016, using as reference the lowest salary at Fluidra's Spanish companies
that represent most companies included in report. [G 4 - E C 5 ]

Employee benefits
More than half of the employees have life and accident insurance compared to the total companies mentioned in the report. Among the benefits offered, Fluidra Flex, the flexible remuneration programme implemented in Spain since 2012, provides tax and economic incentives when taking out products such as food vouchers, children care vouchers, education, transportation and health insurance adapting the remuneration to the personal needs of the employee.
In 2016, the number of companies with flexible remuneration came to a total of 22 (Spain), namely 95% of all the companies covered. This year, the percentage of adherence has increased significantly after having extended the programme to all the workforce, with 25% of employees taking out some type of product; health insurance being one
of the most sought-after benefits. [G 4 ­ L A 2 ]
The company shows the utmost respect for the rights of workers and enables freedom of association and representation activities in all its centres. During 2016,
no risk situation whatsoever was detected in this regard. [G 4 - H R 4 ]

Sourcing and retaining talent has become, due to an increasingly competitive labour and business environment, a key asset within any company. This is the reason why Fluidra's HR promotes the creation of their brand as a benchmark employer in the major markets where it operates.
In addition, most employment proposals are launched through internal channels to enable employees to grow professionally.
In 2016, the use of the new Predictive Index (P.I.) tool was adopted with the aim of finding and promoting talent. P.I. tool provides the best match for employees in their workplace by identifying the motivational factors of people for a specific professional challenge.
T a l e n t a s s e s s m e n t [G4-LA10, G4-LA11]
The e-cloud platform calledFluidra Talent, launched for performance assessments purposes in 2013, has continued its development. The scope was expanded in 2016 to reach more people in the organisation. The system assesses both individual targets and key competencies for each role.
In order to help new arrivals, a face-to-face training programme took place to introduce them to the system and to take advantage of the annual assessment process called One 2 One.
In 2016, 37.8% of the workforce included the report had participated in this programme, with a 21.4% increase in the number of assessments over the previous year.
This tool (called One 2 One) serves the purpose of encouraging dialogue between managers and employees by helping prioritise objectives and identifying training and career plans.

Fluidra Talent
In 2016, the management modules in the Human Resources platform, called Fluidra Talent, have been extended. In the first quarter, the design and production of the corporate Training module (Fluidra Academy) took place, and the Succession module was implemented during the second. The forecast for 2017 is to implement the remaining two modules: Selection and Connection.
The objective of this platform is to help managers streamline their team of collaborators and the employees have their own employee portal. During 2017, the platform will continue to be implemented in other companies outside Spain.

Training

In 2016, 802 courses were conducted for a total of 1,954 employees, with an average ratio of 16 hours per employee, above the 13-hour average of the previous year. The final number of hours devoted to training was
32,040, 72 % higher than the previous year. [G 4 - L A 9 , G 4 - L A 1 0 ]
In 2016, language training was reinforced along with the maintenance and production functional areas.

Corporate training
The FluidrAcademy school, with its motto Where you work, where you learn, remains a benchmark for training and development at the corporate level and maintains its aim of becoming the future corporate university of the group, with the aim of Fluidra becoming not only a place of work, but also a place where people learn and share knowledge and experiences.
Managerial Skills Programme
During the year, the Managerial Skills Programme for two groups of managers ­one Spanish and one international­ and middle managers continued.
The same programme also kicked-off for middle management, in which two groups participated in 2016. This programme received very positively feedback from the participants.
Business School
This programme aims to improve the performance of Fluidra's sales team and is based on three pillars:
· Product knowledge through online courses.
· Improved business skills with face-to-face sessions and experiential training.
· Individual coaching for business managers.
In 2016, the training course "Sales Skills" was provided to five commercial groups: one in Asia, one in Germany, one in the Middle East and India and two in Spain (Bilbao and Barcelona). As a result of this, 12% of Fluidra's sales team has already been trained.
In addition, six online product training pills were designed and published during the year for the commercial team to improve their knowledge about the different products Fluidra sells:
· Viron · HVAC · Chemical - Disinfection · Chemical - Water Treatment · Robots · Swimming pools

Lean Management
The 2016 training plan for Lean Management trained 180 new people in Lean concepts, reaching the figure of 1,300 employees trained since the programme's inception.
The training plan was carried out through the following modules:
· Talleres Lean · Introducción al Lean · Lean G30 · Auditorías Lean
Training in "People Values" ( C o d e o f E t h i c s ) [G4-SO4]
In 2016, 100% of the newly recruited staff, both managerial and other, were trained in anti-corruption policies and procedures through the Fluidra Code of Ethics course.
Occupational Health and Safety
[G4-LA7, G4-LA8]
The health and safety of Fluidra's employees is a priority for the company. The Group companies' policies on quality, safety and the environment place particular emphasis on the prevention of occupational hazards.
In 2016, participating companies developed different training methods in safety and prevention. While commercial and corporate service companies have placed more focus on prevention of risks in offices and firefighting, training, industrial companies' training has revolved around issues more specific to their commercial activity, namely courses on safety in freight transport, safety in the use of raised platforms, safety for work at heights and the use of electric pallet trucks, emergency planning, first aid, as well as conducting health and safety campaigns on their premises. In addition, an information and prevention policy whereby the results on accident monitoring and on internal safety inspections are notified through information boards has been implemented.

Each Group company in Spain has its own Risk Prevention Plan which provides regular risk assessments suited to its activity and job positions, and provides the necessary training to all staff, both internal and external.
Prevention plans are usually rolled out through an external prevention service which is implemented by the Prevention coordinators, the Prevention delegates and the Health and Safety Committees of each company. Thus, proper detection and control of risks as well as compliance with prevention plans and monitoring of the corrective measures being implemented are ensured.
As for the staff relocated abroad, although the international mobility policy does not make specific reference to risks, diseases and serious accident training, it provides information and advice on these issues in a specific and direct manner.
Employees who travel frequently have emergency health insurance policies and those in longterm assignments abroad have health insurance policies that cover medical contingencies for the duration of the stay.
Equality, diversity and work-life balance
Fluidra has an equality and diversity policy that contains the objectives, principles and responsibilities at the corporate level. In addition, each company adapts the general guidelines to its specific reality to its own processes and regulations. There are, for example, various Group companies that have their own Equality plans such as Fluidra Comercial España and Fluidra S.A. The goal for the coming years is to establish a Corporate Equality Plan linked to the Equality and Corporate Diversity Policy based on Fluidra's S.A. Equality Plan.
These policies ensure equal treatment between men and women, not differentiating between employees who perform the same functions and according to categories and positions. During 2016, records show that 47 and 30 people went on paternity and maternity leave respectively,
all of whom returned at the end of their leave. [G 4 - L A 1 3 ]
Fluidra seeks to help its employees achieve work-life balance within a positive work environment and it does so by implementing measures tailored to the needs of the organisation and the staff. All employees enjoy the rights enshrined in the applicable labour regulations on flexible
working hours, maternity leave, paternity leave and other labour rights. [G 4 - L A 3 ]

Communication channels
Fluidra offers its employees several communication tools:
· The`Confidential Channel'is available on Fluidra's website and intranet and is accessible to all employees. Employees can make inquiries, ask for advice or report an incident through an online form. All communications are handled confidentially and care is taken when making any decision always respecting the people involved.
· `Living Fluidra' is a platform which presents global news of the company's various aspects.
· Fluidra's workers have suggestion boxes at their disposal located in the different companies in which to hand in their proposals on how to improve certain aspects of the company
· Information boards, placed in high-visibility locations within the companies, provide the workers with succinct and accurate information about specific company news.
With all of this in mind, there were no complaints or claims in 2016 about labour practices being inconsistent with the rules
and values of the Group. [G 4 - L A 1 6 ]
No cases of discrimination that violate human rights were reported either, and no production centres were identified as using child
labour or violating the right to collective bargaining. [G 4 - H R 3 , G4-HR4, G4-HR5]

Innovation culture
Fluidra aims to create a culture of innovation with a view to becoming the most innovative company in its sector. Therefore, innovation is one of the fundamental pillars of the future strategy of the company, designed to identify and meet current and future customer needs as well as those of its stakeholders, through costeffective, efficient and sustainable innovation. In 2016, Fluidra invested 1.5% of total sales in R&D&i.
Fluidra's innovation model uses technological and market exploration to identify challenges and opportunities for innovation. Creativity and the generation of ideas enable opportunities in terms of knowledge which is protected or in specific projects that move on to the development stage, to finally be transformed into products and/or solutions that meet the needs of our customers. Monitoring the performance of products in the market is, in turn, an important source of information that feeds the different phases of the model.

In 2016, a new tool was launched to help consolidate and standardise the innovation process in a crosssectional manner within the organisation. This project aims to ensure that product development activities are fully aligned with market needs and the strategy of the company. Just as Fluidra strives to improve the quality of its products, it should also reduce time to market and improve business impact. This is a project that began in 2016 with three pilot cases and will continue during 2017 and 2018 until its implementation across all Fluidra Centres of Excellence and Technical Centres.

One of the projects rolled out in 2016 was the review of the Strategic Plan for R&D&i to adapt it to the future needs of Fluidra. The aim is to adopt the new plan within the first four months of 2017 and begin its implementation immediately.
External collaborators
Another key element of the innovation structure is the extensive network of external collaborators made up of technology centres, universities and companies specialising in technology, among others, making it possible to promote the development of new products and solutions, to enable access to the latest technologies.
Similarly, the participation of Fluidra in clusters such as the Catalan Water Partnership or sports industry cluster Indescat, and the Cluster for Advanced Materials (MAV) encourages contact with companies and related entities and bolsters innovation as well as the development of new products and solutions. For several years now, Fluidra has been a permanent member of the Eurecat Club for Innovation.

Fluidra Accelera
In its commitment to promoting innovation, Fluidra Accelera looks for projects related to the water industry, and for technologies with high growth potential, to carry out the necessary actions to attract investors and transform a start-up into a profitable company.
Activities and workshops
As part of its goal of becoming the most innovative company in its industry, Fluidra promotes activities and workshops which use tools that foster creativity, identifying opportunities and challenges so that new solutions, products and services can be created. Specifically, a workshop to identify macro trends that may significantly impact the company's business has been conducted, with the aim of exploring opportunities for innovation that can give birth and identify new innovation projects.
Another activity that was launched during 2016 is to involve society in Fluidra's innovative process. To this end, we have set in motion a contest called "Inventem el Futur de les Piscines" (Inventing the Future the Pools) which consists in involving educational centres in the innovation of the company. It specifically aims to foster creativity in primary education students and the innovation skills of vocational training students. Different educational centres have been selected, most notably those centres that are part of the Xarxa d'Escoles Creatives (Creative Schools Network), whom have been presented with an innovative challenge related to the needs of the company. In the first phase, the challenge is presented to primary schools so that the teams of students suggest ideas related to this challenge. In the second phase, the ideas selected are passed on to the teams of students from vocational training centres who will turn them into product proposals to be presented to Fluidra for evaluation.

Technology
Complying with all safety and quality standards related to the swimming pool industry implies a major effort by Fluidra. An example of this effort is the construction of a facility in Poltank that will allow all Fluidra companies that may be interested to test and verify that the filters meet the European standard EN 16713, which defines the filtration requirements for residential pool, and demands that the filter performance is measured, among other parameters.
For over 14 years, Fluidra has actively participated in various standardisation committees in which the different rules that apply to the sector and affect both the product and the facilities are discussed and defined.
A project for Industrial Doctoral Students was launched in 2016 jointly with the UPC's CIM Foundation, and with the support of Catalonia's Department of Economy and Knowledge development of a design methodology for manufacturing in-demand high-variability pieces with additive technologies.
Throughout 2016, several pilot projects were developed, which have involved different Fluidra Centres of Excellence with the aim of proving the feasibility of integrating Additive Manufacturing technologies, both in production processes and in product development. Among the projects that have been initiated, it is worth mentioning those related to the following:
· Rapid tooling: design and manufacture of moulds and tools for short ranges and mould validation.
· Rapid manufacturing: design and manufacture of final parts of low demand, complex geometry parts and product customisations.

In recent months, Fluidra has continued the process of improving usability, energy efficiency and reducing noise level in its range of pumps, with solutions already applied in KIVU and Victoria Plus Silent. The product improvements are the result of working with new materials, using the latest plastic that allow better dimensional stability, and use of mechanical and hydraulic calculation programmes by finite element, reducing friction and failures due to dimensional errors. Similarly, Fluidra continues to work closely with engine suppliers to improve the product and use new technologies in drives, as well as in quality control processes.
Thanks to its redesign processes, Fluidra has managed to increase the energy efficiency
of the pumps by up to 15%. [G 4 - E N 7 ]
Industry 4.0
Fluidra has started the path towards Industry 4.0: integrating Additive Manufacturing technologies, along with digitisation and intensive use of internet, among other technologies, which will lead to smarter and more eco-friendly industrial plants and processes, and to supply chains and markets that are much better interconnected.
Protection of Intellectual Property (IP)
From corporate R&D&i monitoring and scouting of technology are coordinated together with the management and protection of the portfolio of intangible assets (patents and trademarks), and training for the different CoEs on issues concerning the protection of such intangible assets throughout the value chain.
For the development and launch of new products, the group has implemented a number of internal processes that incorporate the review of the potential risks of infringement of third party rights. In addition, regular monitoring of the specific technologies that are of interest to the group as well as those of the main competitors are carried out for any possible IP protection application that may be relevant. The group also has various internal processes such as creation and alignment of policies so that group policies are aligned to the legal changes regarding trade secret regulations.
Fluidra has a Trademark Committee, consisting of the heads of marketing, communication and intellectual property who meet once a month to discuss the strategy for the group's trademarks, optimising the current portfolio and other issues related to trademarks and domains.
In 2016, there were no litigation or sale bans against Fluidra products. [G 4 - P R 6 ]

Customer training
Fluidra is aware that customer training is an essential way to, on the one hand, achieve shared goals more effectively, and, on the other, better understand their expectations and achieve greater interactivity and loyalty with them. For this reason, in 2016 the company held more than 100 training sessions for their customers with the aim of improving their product knowledge and sales skills.
Factory tours 2016
Abiding by the principle that Fluidra is not only a distributor but also a manufacturer, the company arranges visits to the main production units with a dual purpose: to show the production capacity of the facilities and to improve their knowledge about Fluidra products thanks to the participation of factory experts in the provision of training. In 2016, 20 tours with a duration of 2 to 3 days were carried out, and attended by more than 375 customers in 20 countries around the world.
In addition to purely educational initiatives, Fluidra promotes numerous meetings to enter into contact relevant industry partners such as meetings, fairs, incentive trips, events or specific campaigns to launch new products.

Fluidra complies with current legislation as regards the level of information provided on and labelling of their products. The company has created a work group which includes the main productive actions to improve any inconveniences that may arise in markings on packaging, export documentation, etc.
Product information manuals are translated into the language of the country where they are sold.
100% of the products are labelled. Due to the wide range of products, each of the categories was labelled based on features and functionality. The information included in the label is included in the data sheet for each product, which is accessible on public products databases on the website of each trademark of the group.
Loyalty programmes
In order to reward loyalty, the programmes to encourage the use of Fluidra products have been ramped up, especially those aimed at sustainable use. These programmes include, among others, the Official Partner Programme (Astralpool), Aquaspecialist, Duty (CTX) and Alliance in Australia - and receive advertising support on POS and access to exclusive products.
Boosting e-commerce
In order to promote and introduce new information technologies among customers, Fluidra is expanding its B2B platforms in different markets (http://b2b.fluidra.es; http://pro.fluidra.fr/; etc.).
The strategy to promote the online channel is supported by the use of specific profiles on major social networks (YouTube, Twitter and LinkedIn). During 2016, the companies FCE and GRE launched a new loyalty programme for customers of the internet channel. This programme aims to reward good practices in the marketing of the product through this channel and to support the @partners who contribute the most to the strategic brands AstralPool, CTX and GRE.
Progress has also been made in the preparation of various product configurators to help professionals make the right choice within the wide range of Fluidra's products according to the needs of each installation and customer.
As a result of our efforts to boost e-commerce, in 2016 e-sales increased 6% over those recorded in the previous financial year.

Fluidra's commitment to quality added a new milestone in 2016 with the definition of the role of the Group Quality Manager"

Quality
Product quality is one of the main pillars of Fluidra's strategy, a principle for which, in 2016, the new role of Group Quality Manager was defined. In close coordination with the quality managers of each company and the after sales department (SAT) its mission is to develop a quality management system and to standardise methodologies, with the ultimate goal of reducing quality incidences for customers and internal groups.
During the past financial year, the priority for the area responsible for quality has been the consolidation of Quality Monitoring Committees by company and by strategic product where the issues with the greatest impact are discussed. The target proposed for 2016 had been a 10% reduction of customer complaints over the previous year. Thanks to the measures taken this year and in previous years, a 17% reduction of customer lines complaints was achieved at year end compared to last year, as it is displayed in the chart below.

To achieve such a significant improvement in the variables analysed, the work performed in this area has focused on two main targets this year:
Customers: The monitoring of customer complaints is performed through indicators and through Quality Committees that perform such action by company and by product, depending on the impact and criticality thereof. In 2016, this was carried out for the Robots, Poolmac and Led products. To consolidate indicators to follow through companies that are integrated into the Integrated Quality Management platform (IQM).
Products: FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) for Design and Process is a tool that works in the detection, assessment and prevention of possible failures inherent to product design and process. The use of the application has enabled Fluidra to achieve more solid product designs and processes. In 2016, this tool was applied to the following products: Victoria Plus pump, Leds, Chlorinator, Valves, Hydroton and Hercules robots.

YEAR REVIEW and future challenges
[G4-12]

Carlos Picola Head of Procurement

Financial year 2016 was globally characterised by an increased purchase volume of around 5%, slightly below the business growth of the group. The year was marked by a decline in world prices of listed commodities (oil, gas, metals), especially in the first few months of the year.
However, other factors such as the gradual recovery of demand as well as the OPEC agreement in November which limited oil production, have raised the price of these commodities. For example, the price of the Brent barrel rose from $ 28 a barrel in January to $ 56 a barrel in late December.
Likewise, electricity and gas prices followed a similar trend, decreasing for the first three months of the year to reach all-time lows in March-April, then rebounding gradually the rest of the year. The closure of some nuclear power plants in France in September, together with an unfavourable weather, caused stressed in the European electricity market in the last quarter of the year, which continued in early 2017.
Low prices for oil and metals in the first half favoured improvements in derivative product costs, especially resins (ABS, PP, PE), engines and steel, without any stress caused by the supply side as it happened in 2015.
After the sharp weakening of the euro exchange rate in 2015, 2016 witnessed a strengthening of the US dollar, with an

additional appreciation of 3% against the euro and 6% against the yuan. This led to improved prices for raw materials and products imported from China.
From the point of view of procurement of electricity supply, Fluidra entered into a power supply agreement with a new provider company for the 2016-2018 period. The new supplier supplies type A green energy, certified by the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (National Commission on Financial Markets and Competition) from 100% renewable sources, to the 55 supply points of the group in Spain, which will contribute significantly to reducing the carbon footprint of the Fluidra group in the coming years.
In terms of energy, Fluidra has continued to improve the efficiency of most plants and consumption points of the group in Spain, where energy consumption growth was below production growth. This improvement is the result of the measures and investments implemented from energy audits conducted in 2014. As a key milestone for 2016, Royal Decree 56/2016 on energy efficiency, forced companies that met certain volume and consumption requirements to conduct energy efficiency audits. Fluidra, as a business group, fell within the specific conditions of the Royal Decree, and so met all required energy audits to cover 85% of total consumption.
The implementation of the Group's policy on vehicles continues to generate reductions in emissions as the vehicles with maturity in the financial year are renewed for vehicles with lower emission levels than the previous ones. Improving the sustainability of the vehicle fleet is one of the points to be addressed within Fluidra's CSR Master Plan.
An important aspect worth highlighting in 2016 is that, from the agreements with the corporate travel management company, the group incorporated in the calculation the carbon footprint emissions attributable to Fluidra as a result of the movement of its employees.
Purchase and approval policy
Fluidra has continued to develop the suppliers policy in line with the commitments of honesty and integrity that define the group. The new Purchase policy has been approved and is scheduled for dissemination and implementation during 2017.

We continue working on the progressive centralisation of the different companies common to the various suppliers, so that the maximum possible synergies are achieved. Chemical products are an example of this approach.
A key milestone within this progressive centralisation is the creation of the company Fluidra Global Distribution under the Invictus project. FGD comprises most of the finished product purchases from third-party suppliers outside the group, with a progressive increase in its turnover. This trend will continue in future years, following the roll-out of the Invictus project.

Local suppliers
Given the close relationship and knowledge of our suppliers, 42% of the group's purchases are carried out in Spain. The remaining 58% are imported products or products used in the same productive areas where they are manufactured. Thus, the purchase impact for local suppliers is significant, avoiding unnecessary movements of goods while promoting the local
economy. [G 4 - E C 9 ]
It is important to note that the volume of purchases from China is strongly affected by the purchase of chemicals, as China is the only manufacturer of many of these products in the world.

CSR in the supply chain
One of the cornerstones of Fluidra in its relationship with suppliers of raw materials and services is the Supplier Code of Ethics. This Code is present in the approval process and its membership is automatically implemented by the general clauses in all corporate agreements and automatic ordering system.
The Code is inspired by the United Nations Global Compact, advocating human rights and fighting corruption are both essential and paramount.

[G4-LA14, G4-LA15, G4-HR10, G4-HR11, G4-EN32, G4-EN33]
Following the lead of the previous year, Fluidra is implementing a systematic process of social risk assessment for suppliers categorised as critical for the company.
The criticality of suppliers is determined by their purchase volume and degree of involvement in the business. In this respect, all suppliers of materials and services with purchasing volumes above  500,000 are considered critical and must therefore be assessed regarding their ethical, social and environmental behaviour.
In 2016, continuing with last year's assessment process and the criticality criteria in place, the number of suppliers exceeded 170, which together represent a purchase volume of around 57% of the total.
The objective for 2017 is to cover all critical suppliers and move forward with other suppliers based on their purchase volume.
Social risk assessment of our suppliers allows us to manage our risk against third parties and thus be able to establish preventive and corrective measures ahead of possible contingencies of social and environmental nature.
Based on the assessment results, the level of social risk of suppliers is satisfactory, without any reports of unsatisfactory labour and human rights practices. Only 7.1% of assessments detect room for improvement without determining a serious
violation of rights. [G4-L A14, G4-L A15, G4-HR10, G4-HR11]

However, none of the suppliers were found at risk of child exploitation nor were any of the organisations found to have
violated the worker's rights to collective bargaining. [G 4 - H R 4 , G4-HR5]
Regarding the environmental assessment of Fluidra's suppliers, there is an analysis procedure in place on 100% of suppliers over a 3-year cycle in all production plants through the implementation of ISO14001 and EMAS environmental certificates. Such procedures set monitoring and compliance references in environmental matters of suppliers, establishing mechanisms for a possible operational veto of the provider in case of serious breach of the environmental legislation.
No serious incidents of breach of the environmental legislation were found in suppliers and therefore all contracts remain in
place. [G 4 - E N 3 2 , G 4 - E N 3 3 ]
Following the analysis of suppliers and production centres carried out, no significant risks of forced labour were detected.

Energy efficiency, energy consumption and energy-efficient products
The power supply of Fluidra comes from 100% renewable sources. Green energy contributes to reducing
the carbon footprint of the Fluidra group. [G 4 - E N 1 9 ]
Fluidra decreased consumption of electricity from the public grid and from cogeneration by 35.86%. This year's diesel consumption increased by 31.91%. Regarding consumption of natural gas, there was an increase
of 17.58%. [G 4 - E N 3 , G 4 - E N 6 , G 4 - E N 1 9 ]
Fluidra promotes energy efficiency among businesses and in 2016 the following actions in energy efficiency were carried out:
· Acquisition of energy-efficient equipment and machinery: energy-efficient injection machines (one machine in Cepex, three new machines in Sacopa and one in Prelast), a servomotor press (Prelast, SA) and two items of free-cooling refrigeration equipment (Cepex).
· Installation of energy-efficient lighting by replacing fluorescent lights and projectors by LED lighting (Sacopa, Cepex SAU) and use of natural light (Fluidra Portugal, LDA).
· Implementation of energy control system through Metalast analysers in 2016 and from 2015 in Cepex.
· Staff awareness campaigns in order to make everybody aware of the need to use energy efficiently and reduce consumption (ATH, Idegis, Cepex, Sacopa, Metalast).
· Promoting the use of good environmental practices: always turning off lights and air cooling systems when the rooms are not in use and at the end of the day, the use of centralised systems or thermostats that allow users to set the temperature thus reducing energy consumption and preventing unnecessary consumption, turning off screens and computers at the end of the day (ATH, Cepex, Fluidra, S.A.U., Metalast, Poltank, Sacopa, Talleres del Agua and Fluidra Portugal).
· In relation to energy-efficient products, companies like AstralPool, Fluidra Australia PTY, Ltd. focus on developing and selling energy-efficient products (for example Viron Pumps). Sacopa, with Ignialight, engages in the manufacture of lighting for fountains, street lighting, industrial architectural lighting and sports facilities that facilitate energy efficiency.
· Sacopa, through the app FESEDIT, encourages the use of shared transport between workers reducing the use of private transport.

Emission of air pollutants

The Fluidra Group companies do not release significant amounts of substances into the atmosphere which may be harmful to the ozone layer as part of their activities. However, preventive and control measures are in place. One of the risks monitored at the corporate level is the weather, as it is an element that can affect
the business as a whole. [G 4 - E C 2 ]

Training and awareness campaigns
The Induction Manual is given to every person who joins Fluidra in order to convey the mission and values of the company. Fluidra's Code of Ethics also includes the business conduct standards and is provided to all employees of the Group.

Fluidra raises awareness on optimisation and responsible use of natural resources such as water, promoting the participation of employees in competitions and community activities.
Workplaces raise awareness on environmental conservation such as how to sort waste properly, efficient use of energy, responsible use of water, proper handling of chemicals and steps to be taken in emergency situations. A clear example of this type of training is the training courses held in 2016 in Inquide (environmental emergencies such as fire situations) and Cepex (training in accidental spills and handling of chemicals) that illustrate these pages.

Minimisation of packaging waste
Fluidra is aware of the waste the packaging of its products generates: mostly paper, cardboard and plastic, since the packaging is made in grouped and palletised cardboard boxes or, depending on the product, in plastic or metal containers. Due to environmental legislation demands, some of the Group companies must submit Waste Reduction Plans on packaging to the regional authority's competent body. Among the measures implemented to minimise the environmental impact generated by the product, the following stand out:
· Reduction of the amount of single-use packaging waste on the market, increasing the proportion of recyclable packaging in relation to non-recyclable ones and using, ­as far as possible­ recycled materials and containers whose physical properties or characteristics provide for recovery and recycling. (Sacopa)
· Reusable plastic boxes replacing cardboard boxes and internal transport of components between warehouses (Prelast, Cepex).
· Reuse of wooden pallets of raw materials for internal use. (Poltank, Cepex)
· Reuse of cardboard boxes that are received with equipment from suppliers and customers which are used to pack and ship. (Idegis, Cepex)
· Reduction of the packaging size (cardboard, etc.). (Manufacturas GRE).
· Increasing the number of boxes per pallet in the shipments of some items. (Manufacturas GRE).

Fluidra works continuously to reduce waste generated by the packaging of its products

Water consumption

Fluidra's mission is to bolster society's development and progress through sustainable use of water in its leisure, domestic and industrial applications. The group is especially concerned about saving water and despite the fact that overall consumption is not high and that processes do not require a large amount of water, companies carry out consumption controls for detecting and repairing leaks in the network and misuse or unnecessary use caused by poor practices, and also carry out continuous awareness internal campaigns for the team on the importance of appropriate use.

During 2016, 76,722 m3 were consumed, a figure that was reduced by 9.4% over the previous year: 84,709 m3. There is a clear 10.1% reduction of reused water.

Neither in 2016 nor in previous years were the water abstraction sources significantly
affected, always under the concession granted. [G 4 - E N 9 ]

-9%

In 2016, water use minimisation and optimisation actions were also carried out, among which the following stand out:
· Many workplaces use closed-mould cooling circuits (Cepex, Poltank, Sacopa, Prelast) while others contain water tanks or reservoirs to test products (ATH). These tanks allow water consumption to be optimised. Similarly, other companies reuse water for production purposes, these waters often come from water for cleaning equipment, water recovered from decanters or press filters, among others (Inquide) or they reuse the water for pool testing (Manufacturas GRE).

Reducción del consumo de agua

· Inquide reuses water for cleaning machinery for production, water from decanters, water recovered from the press filter Wastewater Treatment Station (WWTS) and water from the evaporation plant (condensed). In 2016, water consumption was reduced given that only 2,800 hours of work were completed at ATCC compared to 3,900 hours of work in 2015.

· Following the saving and environmental sustainability policy of the company, ATH has a water tank with a pressure pump to perform hydraulic tests on the product. With this initiative, ATH achieves estimated savings for each hydraulic test of around 150-300 litres.

· Poltank continues to perform consumption checks to detect leaks.

· Cepex reused decalcification water for toilet cisterns.

· Although there were leaks in some of the circuits this year (Prelast) as well as an increase in consumption (Cepex), this has not significantly influenced the final result, which has been reduced.

Inquide, located in Monzón, is the only Group company that holds a special system of surface water intake from the Ebro river basin for sanitation, domestic and industrial use. Industrial demand for the Ebro basin is 470 Hm3, of which 258 correspond to industries not connected to municipal networks. During 2016, Inquide channelled 0.0279 Hm3 representing 0.0059%. During 2015, it channelled 0.0399 Hm3, which represents 0.0084%. This decrease is due to the fact that working hours at the ATCC plant were
2,800, compared to 3,900 hours of work in 2015. [G 4 - E N 9 ]

Environmental protection

Fluidra Group companies are located in industrial estates or urban areas outside natural areas of special protection. For this reason, biodiversity is protected only through conservation of native species in neighbouring gardens of the perimeter of the facility.

Minimisation of w a s t e w a t e r [G4-EN22]
Black water is mostly discharged directly to the public network, although some Group companies incorporate them into their production processes.
In 2016, discharges were 9% less than in 2015. The following actions taken during the year are worth highlighting:
· Inquide Monzón has a biological treatment plant where grey water is treated. This system discharges treated water through filtration wells in the absence of public sewers in the area. The remaining wastewater in Monzón generated from production processes is managed internally as waste, and deposited in storage reservoirs for natural evaporation.
· Metalast has a physical-chemical water treatment system to treat processed waters. During this year, Metalast built a tank for regulating the flow rate and inlet concentrations of water in the plant. All other group companies have closed water circuits which allow reuse and, thus, savings.
During financial year 2016, no significant spills in Fluidra Group companies occurred, nor did any impacts on biodiversity due to discharges of treated water. Wastewater
discharges comply with environmental legislation. [G 4 - E N 2 4 , G 4 - E N 2 6 ]

Optimising the management and treatment of waste [G4-EN22, G4-EN23, G4-EN25]
The waste generated is sorted and treated in compliance with current legislation. Its management is aimed at reducing, reusing and recycling both at origin and through authorised processing companies and as a by-product. Of the waste generated by Fluidra in 2016, 38% was hazardous waste and the remaining 62% non-hazardous waste.
In 2016, workplaces managed, by recovery at source, recovery and management of the by-product, 70.8% of the waste generated, while 29.2% was managed by treatment or disposal. In 2015, it was managed by management at source, recovery and management of the by-product, 76.9% of the waste generated, while 23.1% was managed by treatment or disposal.
Fluidra Group companies do not transport or treat waste internationally classified as hazardous, in compliance with Annexes 1, 2, 3, and 8 of the Basel Convention; all treatment or transportation that may result from such waste is performed in the country.

Milestones in 2016

Fluidra's Day - "With your help, they win"
Coinciding with World Water Day, Fluidra's Day takes place on 22 March. For four years now, the group's workforce has been given one month to suggest solidarity projects related to water, childhood and sustainability. The three projects selected by the CSR Committee receive a donation of EUR 3,000, and in 2016 the winners were:

· "Swimming Programmes for Israeli Arabs," by Shoshana Mueller (Aquatron Robotic Technology Ltd., Israel), which promotes understanding between young victims of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
· "Paralympic Swimming Open Competition of Castile and Leon," by Leopoldo González Alonso (Fluidra Comercial España), who suggested a swimming competition for children and young people with mental disorders.
· "Aquatic Physiotherapy" by María José Rey (Fluidra Comercial España), with the aim of organising water activities to foster psychomotor development of children with physical and mental disabilities.
Song "Fluidra in your hands" (Fluidra a les teves mans)
With the title "Fluidra in your hands", Juan Martínez Rillo (Cepex) composed a song dedicated to the company which was the motto for the eighth edition of the children's contest for Fluidra families. The winner was Júlia Cosp, the ten-year-old daughter of a Sacopa employee (see drawing on p. 142).

Fluidra photo contest on INSTAGRAM
In 2016, Fluidra launched a public photo contest on Instagram with the hashtag #WaterfulSummer2016. The contest had previously taken place for eight years in the summer among employees of the group. In 2016, the general public participated, contributing with highquality photos, and it was a great success. The winner was awarded a GoPro camera.
Strategic Cluster Change Conference
In 2016, Public agency Acció and IESE Business School acknowledged Fluidra as a business success case within the framework of the Strategic Cluster Change Conference held in Barcelona. This acknowledgement was based on the company's adaptive capacity to trends, embodied in the newly launched pool system based on the internet of things.

Fluidra's contribution to the societies in which it is present is implemented, among other things, through the responsible payment of its taxes

TAX CONTRIBUTION AND COMMITMENT
Fiscal commitment
Fluidra permanently upholds its commitment to good governance, transparency and integrity, which, together with the creation of value for shareholders and investors, are part of its management and business ethos. Compliance with the current tax legislation at any time and place is one of the principles underlying the corporate responsibility of the Fluidra group.
Fluidra has defined a fiscal strategy that includes, among its objectives, compliance with current tax legislation, adopting a reasonable interpretation thereof based on the principles of transparency, mutual trust, good faith and loyalty. Similarly, the objectives of the company: not using opaque or artificial structures or which are outside the activity of the company established with the sole purpose to lessen the tax burden, not operating in jurisdictions deemed as tax havens for purposes other than the usual running of business operations of Fluidra and working so that transactions with related parties are governed by a principle of free competition.
Following the publication of the 15 measures of the OECD BEPS plan, the group has launched reviewed draft recommendations issued with the aim of adapting the regulatory changes to the countries in which it operates.

T a x c o n t r i b u t i o n s [G4-EC1]
Fluidra's business activity generates wealth in the areas where it has a presence, both through its own impact on local economies and tax contributions. Fluidra is aware of the importance of its contributions to the local economy and therefore maintains a strict policy in terms of tax contributions in the countries where it operates.
Fluidra's tax contributions in 2016 amounted to EUR 32.5 million in direct taxes. That amount includes the expense for corporate income tax accrued in 2016 and the payment of employer social security contributions.
The breakdown of the overall amount by geographic area reveals that Fluidra contributed 66.4% of the total direct tax contribution in Spain, 12.6% in France, 3.7% in the UK, 3.1% in Australia, 3.7% in the United States, 4% in Italy, 4% in Austria, 1.5% in Portugal and 0.6% in Belgium. Fluidra pays these taxes directly to the Tax Authorities of the aforementioned countries.
The business activity that Fluidra carries out in these regions generates significant revenue for the countries' treasury. The total indirect taxes channelled by Fluidra for these institutions in 2016 amounted to EUR 28.7 million.

Joan Planes President of Fluidra Foundation

At Fluidra, we have always believed in sustainable water use and in democratising its access to all groups of people. We value culture in general and music in particular as a way to ensure dignity for people"

Fluidra Foundation
In 2016, Fluidra created the Fluidra Foundation, a logical step in its commitment to society, to better focus its corporate social responsibility initiatives and achieve greater impact.
The Fluidra Foundation selects and optimises grants and sponsorship deals that had, to date, been applied from Fluidra and also takes the lead in conducting its own actions which are aligned with its commitments:
· Social commitment: projects aimed at accessibility, awareness and education on water use.
· Cultural commitment: to disseminate music as a tool for personal growth and to promote personal dignity.
The Fluidra Foundation will carry out projects related to water access for disadvantaged groups and will promote culture, specifically music. Joan Planes, founder and honorary president of Fluidra will chair this institution.

Principles for determining the content and quality of the 7.1 report
In the preparation of this integrated report, Fluidra followed the GRI principles that determine its content through the participation of groups of interests defined in its Mission, understanding sustainability in a broad sense, performing the materiality study as a cornerstone of its sustainable development and following the principle of comprehensiveness in the presentation of indicators and data.
Following the GRI guidelines in determining quality, this report presents balanced and transparent information, although comparability with previous reports is hampered by the incorporation of new companies in the coverage of information which may, in some cases, distort comparability.
A computerised system for reporting corporate information enables Fluidra to obtain accurate data without abusing estimates in the calculations.
This report, following the principle of timeliness, is exclusively presented every year on the day of the General Shareholders' Meeting of Fluidra as part of the documentation for shareholders.
By basing the contents of the report on international standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Integrated International Reporting Council (IIRC), the company is able to abide by the principle of clarity and facilitate access to any information that stakeholders may request.
Finally, Fluidra is responsible for the reliability of the data reported by external and independent verification, and makes available to stakeholders contact details in order to answer any questions and requests for information.

About this report
7.2 [G4-6, G4-22, G4-23, G4-28, G4-29, G4-30]

This annual report covers the business activity of Fluidra in 2016 and has been drafted and structured according to the IR framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). For reporting on non-financial aspects, the drafting guide of the Sustainability Report Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) version 4 has been followed, in line with the Exhaustive criteria.
Approval of the report is performed by the CSR Committee as the
regulatory body for sustainability issues. [G 4 - 4 8 ]
One aspect on which more work was carried out in 2016 is the materiality matrix. While in 2015 Fluidra's materiality was determined by the relationship with stakeholders, this year a specific study was carried out on 500 people representing the various Fluidra stakeholders. The results of the study are presented in the corresponding materiality section.

Another new aspect in this report is the expansion of the GRI coverage. While financial data are consolidated for the entire group, non-financial information, in many respects, corresponds to the consolidation of companies covered in the report. This year, coverage has been extended to all companies in the UK and France, including Belgium, as well as to the companies in Austria, Italy and Portugal. Therefore, information coverage reaches 69% of the consolidated turnover of the group with a substantial 54% increase over the previous year. Notably, increasing coverage directly affects the comparability of the report compared to data from previous years.
The following table identifies all companies consolidated in the financial statements, identifying the type and coverage of the companies. Companies marked with (*) are new companies
included in the coverage this year. [G 4 - 2 2 , G 4 - 2 3 ]

Materiality study
[G4-18, G4-19, G4-20, G4-21]
Fluidra is a multinational business group integrated both vertically and horizontally, a key feature which adds complexity when defining the materiality of the group.
From the perspective of vertical integration, we define groups of companies based on:
· Production companies, whose aim is the manufacture of finished products from raw materials.
· Commercial and logistic companies, which specialise in distribution and placing the finished product on the market.
· Service and management companies, which support Group companies and, in some cases, other companies outside the scope of Fluidra.
From a horizontal integration perspective, Fluidra companies are defined based on their sector of activity: plastics, chemical, metallurgical, glass, product assembly and technology, commercial, transport and logistics and management services companies. Due to this complexity, in order to determine the materiality of Fluidra, a comprehensive approach must be adopted.
This year, Fluidra carried out a study among its stakeholders in order to further analyse the materiality of the group. The process consisted of a round of random surveys to shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and associations in the social field: a total of 500 were sent with a response rate of 28%.
The study focused on aspects related to the environment, the economy, good working practices and decent work, human rights, society and product responsibility. The questionnaire was distributed as follows: firstly, respondents were asked on the degree of relevance they gave to certain aspects, in particular within each of the major areas of sustainability; secondly, they were asked to indicate whether they thought that Fluidra should take more measures in its action on specific issues in each area.
From the score of those issues that the stakeholders identified as highly relevant, along with the corporate valuation of the material aspects for the Fluidra Group, a threshold of 50 points was established to determine the material aspects reflected in the materiality table next to the score matrix of the issues analysed.
