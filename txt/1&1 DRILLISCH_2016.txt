For example, in 2005 the Company became one of the first providers to sell mobile ser vices under its own discount brand name. Similarly, Drillisch began as early as in 2010 to align its product portfolio with the on going changes in the way smartphone cus tomers used their phones. The budget and package plans containing a certain volume of call minutes, text messages and data for a fixed monthly charge were new creations at that time; today they are commonly availa ble on the market. This innovation strength makes it possible for the Group to develop new business fields ahead of competitors.
