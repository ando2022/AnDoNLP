PANORAMA
LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
Dear shareholder,
2018 was a crucial year for EXMAR. By November 2018, in a record time of nearly three months from initial commercial agreement to signing, the Company was able to secure a ten-year tolling contract for its barge-based floating liquefaction unit previously known as CARIBBEAN FLNG with the Argentinian energy multinational YPF. This agreement followed a three-year search to find a suitable partner fol-lowing the bankruptcy of the unit's previous client in May 2016. In December, the renamed barge TANGO FLNG departed on a heavy lift vessel from the yard destined for the Argentinian port of Bahia Blanca. The unit is now alongside, with final preparations being made before entering into production expected during the second quarter of 2019. In October, EXMAR also began receiving income for a charter agreement with commodities trader Gunvor for its barge-based floating regasification unit FSRU 188. 2018 also marked the completion of EXMAR's four-year LPG Midsize newbuild joint venture pro-gramme with Teekay LNG Partners which began with the delivery of midsize LPG/C Waasmunster in May 2014. Since then 13 Midsize newbuild LPG carriers have been delivered to the EXMAR fleet making it one of the industry's most modern, with all vessels currently employed to first class customers. EXMAR also received, from a US-based operator, a license fee for a facility similar to DELTA HOUSE related to a project in Gulf of Mexico after nearly three years of inactivity in the market for final investment decisions in new floating production systems. EXMAR has been under a lot of pressure in the past years. We are now in a much stronger financial position from which to grow the business. The EXMAR boat is back on course. We are back in much calmer water and under a blue sky.
Philippe Bodson, Chairman of the Board of Directors Nicolas Saverys, Chief Executive Officer

MARKET OVERVIEW

VLGC Earnings in the Very Large Gas Carrier (VLGC) segment trended upwards during the second half of 2018 thanks to increased long-haul trading, attractive commodity prices and minor fleet additions. Market returns entered into positive territory again yielding about USD 700,000 per month for the second part of the year compared to USD 470,000 per month in 2017.

US LPG exports reached record levels in 2018

of about 33 million tons, nearly 14% more than

previous year. Buoyant shale gas production and

adequate terminal capacity were pivotal factors

behind the US relentlessly pushing LPG cargoes

to overseas destinations. Far East destinations

now account for more than 50% of US exports

with China, Japan and South Korea all notably

importing clean propane.

It has not only been the US that has been pro-

levels of close to 39 million tons, compared to

solidates the region's position as primary global exporter.

China and India remain the main import drivers with Japanese imports stabilizing at around 11 million tons per year. China imported 18.8 million tons in 2018, which is a moderate increase of 3% compared to 2017.
Despite there being signs of manufacturing activity slowing down in China with the US-China trade relationship hanging in the balance, China is expected to take in more LPG in 2019 thanks to the start-up of four new propane dehydrogenation plants.
India also reached record import levels of over 12 million tons in 2018 (approximately 2% more than 2017) with most of the growth accounted for by rural areas boosting consumer demand.
In terms of market conditions, the long-haul fully refrigerated segment (VLGC, LGC and MGC) has benefited from healthy demand East of Suez, with incremental demand in Middle

MGC vessels have joined the EXMAR LPG fleet since 2014

Eastern and US Gulf LPG-exports which more than compensated for the number of newbuild deliveries.
Only ten new VLGCs entered the water in 2018, which led to a recovery in market freight rates. The VLGC fleet at year-end amounted to a total of 271 units. However, 19 VLGCs are due for delivery during 2019, which may continue to weigh on the market demand-supply equilibrium. Apart from BW TOKYO, EXMAR currently has no exposure in the VLGC-segment so market risk in this segment is limited.

ACTIVITY REPORT

MIDSIZE In contrast to 2016 and 2017 during which time 27 newbuilds were delivered, only nine new Midsize Gas Carrier (MGC) vessels joined the global fleet in 2018. Accompanied by the upward momentum of both VLGC and Large Gas Carrier (LGC) segments in the course of the year, MGC earnings followed suit given strong LPG and ammonia cargo activities. With only five ships remaining on the fleet order book (OB), freight market conditions look set to improve from this point forward. EXMAR represents one-third of these newbuilding deliveries.

2018 saw COURCHEVILLE (28,000 m³ - 1989 built) sold for recycling in line with the prevailing legislation. The capital gain of approximately USD one million on the sale of the COURCHEVILLE was recorded in the first quarter of 2018.
PRESSURIZED The Pressurized vessel segment has continued to improve during 2018 since its upsurge in 2017. Downstream markets strengthened both East and West of Suez, contributing to more demand

for frequent and small cargo deliveries. Also the distribution of easy petrochemical cargoes such as propylene rose in Far Eastern markets, whereas only eight new Pressurized carriers entered the market. Average rates for 3,500/5,000 m³ ships increased from USD 206,000/250,000 to USD 248,000/297,000 per month during 2017-2018, representing an increase of about 20%.

TESTIMONIAL
EXMAR DELIVERY OF WEPION On 20 July LPG midsize gas carrier WEPION (38,000 m³ ) was named at Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction (HHIC) shipyard in Subic Bay in South Korea, marking the completion of EXMAR's LPG midsize newbuild deliveries. WEPION brings the total number of LPG MGCs to 13 instead of the previously- planned 12. She is not a sister of the other units; the vessel was bought from HHIC after the previous owner cancelled his order.

HIGHLIGHTS 2018 AND OUTLOOK 2019

VLGC On 2 March 2018 EXMAR announced it had contracted two VLGC Newbuildings with LPG as a fuel for the main engine at HHIC to serve long-term commitments with Equinor ASA of Norway for worldwide LPG transportation.
In January 2019 HHIC filed for rehabilitation due to financial difficulties. The construction disruptions caused thereby obliged EXMAR to cancel both Shipbuilding Contracts and invoke the Refund Guarantee from Korean Development Bank (South Korea) to recover each of the Instalments already paid.
In order to fulfil its long-term commitments towards Equinor ASA of Norway and further dedicate its resources to innovative shipping solutions, EXMAR is currently in advanced negotiations with a shipyard to secure stateof-the-art replacement vessels.

BW TOKYO (83,000 m³, 2009 built) performed according to contract and benefited from rises in the Baltic Gas Index.
MIDSIZE In 2018, EXMAR has finalized its MGC newbuild programme which was initiated in 2014. Thirteen energy-efficient vessels have joined the fleet during this period. KAPELLEN (March) and KOKSIJDE (May) were the latest sister ship additions from the Subic Bay shipyard in the Philippines. Also one additional newbuilding was realized with the delivery of WEPION from Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction (HHIC), a contract novated from a cancelled order at the yard. The majority of the MGC fleet is committed to long-term charters with first class customers. In general, EXMAR was able to conclude contracts at higher freight levels than 2017. MGC earnings in 2018 averaged

USD 485,000 per month compared to USD 450,000 per month the year before. The current fleet charter coverage for 2019 stands at 79%.
PRESSURIZED EXMAR continues to efficiently deploy its Pressurized portfolio of ten units with a healthy mix of ships employed East of Suez (China, India, Korea, and Japan) and West of Suez in both LPG and petrochemical trades. 2018 saw full employment of EXMAR's Pressurized fleet, with 100% of the fleet committed during 2019. With only 19 orders for Pressurized vessels left in the newbuild OB, freight market fundamentals in the smallest gas segment look attractive.

MARKET OVERVIEW

In 2018, the LNG markets witnessed significant rises on the supply side, with increasing liquefaction activity predominantly emerging from new terminals in the United States (US) and Australia. This continued growth in world

output is also linked to the growing tendency to substitute oil and coal with natural gas in a bid to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Examples highlighting this trend include Government policies such as the ones being

introduced by the Peoples Republic of China, incentivized project start-ups pushing up supply in regions such as Western Europe and further fuel switching with conversions to LNG as a fuel source.

LNG SHIPPING As displayed in the chart below, 2018 LNG freight markets have been at their most volatile since the LNG shipping markets evolved to an open tramp market like dry bulk and tank seg-

ments about one decade ago. Many reasons have been cited for this volatility. The most frequent cause points towards diverging oil and gas prices that move in line with geopolitical

tensions. These tensions are key in shaping arbitrage opportunities for traders and ship owners alike distributing LNG to an increasingly mature, globalized market place.

FLOATING LIQUEFACTION 2018 marked a major milestone for Floating Liquefaction as several projects became operational or have reached commissioning phase, which is now demonstrating the full potential of FLNG technology.

Several Final Investment Decisions (FID) have been reached, creating further momentum for FLNG solutions. Amongst those, EXMAR has signed a tenyear agreement with YPF for deployment in Bahia Blanca, Argentina to treat, clean and liquefy natural gas from the Vaca Muerta gas fields for export purposes as from the second quarter of 2019.

The agreement confirms that market for floating liquefaction is proven as a quick-to-market infrastructure solution in the LNG value chain. FLNG will play a significant role in the future for the fast-track development of stranded gas resources.

FLOATING REGASIFICATION The current worldwide growth in the FSRU fleet proves that floating regasification has become a mature market with more than 30 units deployed and several units under construction. It is clear that floating regasification infrastructure is the preferred solution over onshore terminal developments. Several floating terminals have started up including projects in Jamaica and Bangladesh.

HIGHLIGHTS 2018 AND OUTLOOK 2019

LNG SHIPPING ACTIVITIES With one LNG carrier EXCALIBUR (owned 50/50 EXMAR/Teekay) remaining in the fleet and servicing a long-term charter contract beyond 2022, EXMAR was sheltered from market volatilities during 2018. This will guarantee a stable income for the coming years and puts the Company in a strong position to take advantage of new LNG shipping opportunities as they arise.

FLNG ACTIVITIES On 21 November, a ten-year charter agreement has been signed with YPF of Argentina to deploy EXMAR's barge-based liquefaction unit (FLNG) in Bahia Blanca. YPF is a front runner in the monetization of the shale gas reserves in Argentina, and with EXMAR's TANGO FLNG, the country will be able to export LNG for the first time in their history.
YPF and EXMAR have achieved an unprecedented commercial record as initial discussions first took place in August 2018. EXMAR is proud that the TANGO FLNG is already installed, safely moored, commissioned and operational in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, only two-and-a-half months after contract signing. An excellent cooperation between both the TANGO FLNG's crew and the shore technical team has ensured that

site specific modifications have been executed at the COSCO shipyard in Shanghai at a record pace and that mobilization could start before year end.
The yearly production of about 500,000 tons LNG will account for an estimated annual EBITDA of USD 43 million per year with a potential upside depending on the market environment.
With the deployment of the TANGO FLNG, EXMAR is in a unique position to develop new FLNG projects. Discussions with several parties

to jointly develop new FLNG projects are ongoing.
FSRU ACTIVITIES In October 2018, EXMAR's barge-based FSRU S188 has been delivered to Gunvor under its ten-year charter agreement.
EXMAR is investigating several business opportunities where its tailor-made approach can create benefits for its customers. Commercial discussions are ongoing.

MARKET OVERVIEW

As most forecasters correctly predicted, world demand for oil rose in 2018, increasing by an average of 1.4 million barrels per day. This increase took demand over the 100 million barrels per day mark for the first time. The increase in demand occurred primarily during the first three quarters of 2018. After experiencing rising prices throughout this period, geopolitical factors cooled oil markets in the fourth quarter with a low of USD 42.50 per barrel based on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) grade benchmark. Oil prices looked to be on the rebound in 2019 as the WTI barrel price finished at arround USD 58 per barrel in March with an annual average of USD 64.90 per barrel in 2018. Most forecasters predict an increase in oil demand of approximately 1.5 million barrels per day for 2019 and further increases in 2020. OPEC cutbacks have been maintained close to planned quotas and is keeping worldwide daily production more closely in balance with demand. However, price volatility in 2019 may continue with geopolitical uncertainty which dampens market appetite for higher capital expenditure (CAPEX) investments in deepwater exploration and production.
Since 2014, offshore operators have cut costs, implemented efficiency improvements, and have re-evaluated the way they design and execute offshore projects. Since deepwater projects compete against shale opportunities for corporate and external capital expenditure funds, offshore developers have been forced to drive breakeven costs down for new offshore infrastructure. Some have succeeded in driving these down in some cases

" Over 200 offshore developments utilizing floating production systems are in the planning
process
to USD 25 or to USD 40 per barrel range. This allows for sanctioning of new offshore projects, especially subsea tie- backs to existing production hubs. The latter not only offers lower costs, but also shorter cycle time and higher returns on investment for the operator. However, most

new field developments requiring installation of new infrastructure will struggle to compete at these levels.
Offshore oil and gas production remains an important component of total daily worldwide energy output at approximately 30% and will continue to be a vital component of future supply. When oil prices were depressed from 2014 to and including 2016, floating production system (FPS) contract awards were down substantially, tracking the price of oil.
With the gradual oil price increases of the last two years, awards have been up in 2017 and 2018 with 21 and 23 units ordered respectively. In the Gulf of Mexico, one semi-submersible unit and one Floating Production Storage and Offload (FPSO) vessel were awarded in 2018. Worldwide contract awards included nine FPSOs plus 11 LNG and other categories in terms of production units.

Deepwater reserves remain an important source of development and monetization by resource owners to supersede the natural decline of existing production. Over 200 offshore developments utilizing floating production systems are in the planning process with approximately two- thirds reaching Final Investment Decision (FID) in the next five or six years. To support these new projects, development drilling should see increases in the rig count, although offshore operator exploration activity may proceed with at a more conservative pace. Drilling contractors continue to reduce the offshore fleet by scrapping and selling less competitive as well as older rigs to non- drilling applications.

ACTIVITY REPORT

ENGINEERING AND DESIGN The first half of 2018 was a very slow period of activity for engineering and design work at EXMAR Offshore's Houston-based operation. In the second half of the year, EXMAR Offshore signed a contract to provide the detailed engineering for the recently sanctioned OPTI® based production semisubmersible which resulted in significant engineering work for the Houston team. This work will continue into 2019.
EXMAR Offshore further broadened its capabilities in floating production design with process engineering expertise. These capabilities provided support for EXMAR's LNG infrastructure projects involving the TANGO FLNG and FSRU S188 Barges, as well as on behalf of third parties. The OPTI® semisubmersible detailed engineering and LNG contract awards resulted in EXMAR Offshore operating at capacity in the second half of 2018 and this work will continue into 2019.
ACCOMMODATION BARGES EXMAR accommodation units serve the need for offshore workers who perform operations and maintenance of existing offshore projects required to sustain the Offshore oil and gas production's share in daily worldwide output. After three years of reduced maintenance programmes and scarcely any new developments, oil companies began sanctioning new projects and revitalizing much needed maintenance activities during 2018 in order to maintain or increase production levels. As a consequence, the market showed signs of a slow rebound in terms of unit utilization and hire rates during the fourth quarter of 2018. This trend is expected to continue from 2019 onwards.
Despite a tough market with a large number of units employed and several in lay-up, EXMAR Offshore's accommodation and work barges outperformed the competition, having been fully employed throughout 2018.
In 2017, the NUNCE accomodation and work barge was extended from 2019 to 2022 with SONANGOL P&P Angola. The unit did not experience any downtime in 2018 and is expected to continue its solid performance during 2019 and beyond.
The WARIBOKO accommodation and work barge continues to be employed by TOTAL E&P off-

HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2018 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2019

OPTI® SERIES FLOATING PRODUCTION SYSTEMS Despite the volatility of oil prices, one operator has executed a contract for the construction of an OPTI® floating production semisubmersible for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico. This new order is a significant achievement for EXMAR at time when only a handful of projects have been sanctioned in recent years. This unit will be similar to EXMAR's OPTI® design on the DELTA HOUSE development and EXMAR has received a license fee for this new OPTI® Series hull at the end of 2018. This will be

the third production system to be installed in the Gulf of Mexico based on EXMAR's proprietary design.
Additionally, EXMAR continues to perform early conceptual design work for a number of potential developments in the Gulf of Mexico based on the highly successful OPTI®- Series semisubmersible design. EXMAR's proven OPTI® based floating production system offers operators a lower cost option to produce deepwater fields and enables a shorter project development cycle time.

shore Nigeria and is expected to secure future employm ent in the region. Last year, despite a small rebound in the market, a large portion of the West African (WAF) accommodation barge fleet remained in lay up. However, given the increase in activities observed during the last quarter of 2018, this situation is set to change with hire rates expected to rise as demand strengthens and also given that the number of units available is less than it was at its peak in 2014 due to barges leaving the region and being scrapped.

FLOATING PRODUCTION STORAGE AND OFFLOADING VESSELS (FPSOs) EXMAR was invited to participate in the FPSO BUZIOS 5 tender to be submitted in early 2018 which resulted in EXMAR being declared lowest price bidder in early July 2018. Due to delays with finalizing commitments from key partners for financing of the project, Petrobras initiated exclusive negotiations with the second place bidder in early 2019 without penalty to EXMAR.

EXMAR SHIP MANAGEMENT AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGISLATIVE EXPERT IN THE GAS NICHE SEGMENT EXMAR has become an expert in retrofitting gas tankers with new ballast water treatment systems (BWTS). LNG carriers and FSRUs must be able to sail anywhere anytime, so EXMAR Ship Management needs to ensure owners comply with the new BWTS regu-

lations. However, the choice of a system is a complex and challenging task ­ requiring substantial subject matter expertise. Vessels such as LNG carriers have large ballast capacities so the challenge emerges in terms of the significant power needed by those systems and the very limited number of systems on the market approved by the authorities.

EXMAR SHIP MANAGEMENT TAILORING ITS SERVICES TO BECOME A PREFERRED CONVERSION EXPERT IN THE LNG NICHE SEGMENT On 5 October 2018 the conversion team of a 138,000 m³ LNG carrier into a floating storage unit (FSU) reached a milestone with the cutting of the first steel plate for the `sponson' structure ­ the start of processing about 680 tons of steel. The sponson will reinforce the hull to protect the vessel against ice adrift at the project location. After the conversion FSU will serve as an intermediate

storage and export terminal for an onshore liquefaction plant in the Gulf of Finland. This location experiences extreme temperatures both during the winter and summer seasons. The vessel required full winterization assessments for operational equipment against ice formation as well as to perform ship-to-ship LNG transfers in frozen conditions. EXMAR already has extensive experience in LNG transfers and regasification operations in extreme heat and humidity having managed operations in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Port Qasim for a number of years now.

the EU towards obtaining the European Union Ship Recycling Regulations Certificate (EUSRR).
During the recycling process there was close contact with the yard and weekly reports were drawn up.
EXMAR undertook careful and thorough due diligence to ensure that the recycling of the COURCHEVILLE was undertaken in the most environmentally friendly way possible and to the highest health and safety standards and conditions.

SAFETY PERFORMANCE Across the EXMAR Ship Management fleet (which incorporate vessels owned outside the Group), the number of Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF) in 2018 slightly increased to 1.47 per million working hours. However, performance varied by ship type. For example, the EXMAR-owned LPG fleet ­ which is the largest in management- reached a record low of 0.52 lost time injuries per million working hours.

Injuries to personnel ­however minor in nature - remain a continuous concern and are given a high level of focus. 41 vessels were visited by members of the senior management in 2018.

SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Internal and External Audits are systematically recorded and followed up with corrective and long term actions. The management review is responsible for monitoring audit frequency in line with internal and external obligations. Five internal audits were found overdue in 2018 but they were performed in the first port after the due date. The system of navigational audits was expanded to remote navigational audits which make use of the on-board recording equipment. The results of these will be used on a fleet- wide basis to improve the navigational performance of the fleet.
The role out of the new ERP is ongoing in the fleet and presently five vessels are equipped with this system, including the safety management system.

PEOPLE ­ OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET

SAFETY BEHAVIOR IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME ­ TAKING THE SAFETY LEAD Since 2014, EXMAR Ship Management has engaged in a behavioural safety programme for its sea and shore staff. Taking the SAFETY LEAD has been integrated in the organization with the implementation of the Safety Vision through training and best practice sharing,

a review of the evaluation system and the implementation of robust hazard identification. In the course of 2018, the focus was on strengthening these cornerstones through a full review of the operational risk assessment library, the development of a control of work programme in line with the UK HSE Guidelines and improving the efficiency of on- board visits. This will be continued in 2019.

HUMAN RIGHTS Out of 64 Port State Control inspections, one was related to the Maritime Labour Convention. In the course of February 2018, .a letter was sent to all major suppliers and partners informing them of our sustainable supplier policy, summing up our business principles.

PERSONNEL RETENTION AND DEVELOPMENT The Crew Experience Matrix is a tool to ensure that the fleet is manned with sufficiently experienced staff in terms of experience on tankers, in the Company and in their function. There have been no internal or external audit remarks on crew matrix issues in 2018.
The two-year based retention rate was 86% for shore staff, 95% for the officers in the fleet and 90% for the ratings. These figures are stable over the years.
94% of the crewmembers of EXMAR's LPG fleet have followed the training in accordance with the internal training matrix. For the whole fleet,

6.18% of the total wage cost was invested in training. Crew conferences were held in 2018 in Antwerp, Buenos Aires, Brussels, Mumbai, Odessa and Split with diverse crews from different nations attending. There are now 58 different nationalities of seafarers (see Page 10) serving on board the vessels of the EXMAR Ship Management fleet of 16 different vessel and barge types.
To further nurture and develop talent onshore, EXMAR senior staff regularly lecture at Maritime Academies, Universities and other education establishments. EXMAR is a regular participant at the Open Day of the Antwerp Maritime Academy, with EXMAR Ship Management offering cadets onboard experience on

an annual basis. Many of the cadets recruited have ended up joining the fleet. Similarly close collaboration with both crewing agencies and maritime education institutions in Jamaica (Caribbean Maritime University), the Philippines (MAPUA school and PHILCAMSAT training center) have resulted in the recruitment of graduates to the EXMAR fleet.
On shore, at the EXMAR headquarters, gender diversity is apparent, with a total of 101 female and 99 male employees working at one of the companies belonging to the EXMAR Group (see Page 10). Staff are supported to develop their skillsets further, with many having been sponsored for Masters Degree studies, Six Sigma training and management courses.

EXMAR RUNNERS PLAY THEIR PART IN BELGIUM'S "WARMEST WEEK" In December 2018, over 40 EXMAR colleagues participated in a special run in Antwerp organized for Belgium's national Christmas charity appeal "De Warmste Week" (the Warmest Week) with a total of

close to 17.3 million euro raised for nearly 2,000 organisations. In cold and blustery weather, the team crossed the river Scheldt to Sint-Anna Linkeroever in the afternoon and in a few hours completed 117 laps

together over 363km, raising over EUR 4,000 for charity. The money was distributed to several charity organizations chosen by the participants.

It's a system of checks and balances between the shareholders, the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Excecutive Committee.
GOVERNANCE MODEL EXMAR NV is governed by the Belgian Company Code and the 2009 Belgian Corporate Governance Code. The key features are:
· A Board of Directors, which defines EXMAR's general policy and strategy and supervises the operational management;
· An Audit Committee, a Nomination and Remuneration Committee and an Executive Committee created by the Board of Directors;
· A Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who takes primary responsibility for operational management.
DESIGNATION APPLICALBE 2009 CODE ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE This Corporate Governance Statement is covered by the provisions of the Belgian 2009 Corporate Governance Code. The Royal Decree of 6 June 2010 recognized the Code of 2009 as the only applicable Code. This Code is published in the Belgian Official Gazette (Moniteur Belge/Belgisch Staatsblad) on 23 April 2010 (www.staatsblad. be), as well as on the website www.corporategovernancecommittee.be.
As a result of the publication of the 2009 Belgian Corporate Governance Code ("Code 2009"), EXMAR has Code 2009 as a reference code.
PRINCIPLES CODE 2009 Pursuant to article 96 §2, 1° of the Belgian Companies Code, EXMAR follows the principles of the 2009 Belgian Code on Corporate Governance:

Environmental accidents, work interruptions caused by mechanical defects, human error, war, terrorism, political actions in various countries, strikes and bad weather. Vessels not meeting certain performance standards.

Any such event would harm our reputation as reliable shipping company and would result in increased costs and an increase of the number of off-hire days. The cost of urgent repairs are more unpredictable and can be very high. In case performance standards are not met the charterer could withhold a portion of the hire.

Our experience within the industry and our policies and procedures such as our maintenance and training program should limit or avoid certain risks inherent in our business. All our vessels and assets are covered by adequate insurance.

INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES

Operating expenses and maintenance expenses can be volatile.

Operating expenses and drydock capital expenditures depend on a variety of factors which are outside our control and affect the entire shipping industry. Drydocking of vessels can also result in loss of income.

Proactive in-house ship management and a continuous internal and external inspection of our assets. Our maintenance policy is updated and improved on a day-to-day basis with the objective to maintain the highest quality levels. Under some commercial agreements the operating expenses are paid on a pass-through basis by the charterer.

ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Specific risks apply to our assets under construction and include the solvency of our contractor as well as the delivery of the asset in accordance with all specifications and securing all required permits.

Failure by the shipyard to construct or deliver our assets or bankruptcy by the shipyard would have a substantial impact on our financial position and our results. In the event the shipyard does not perform and we are not able to enforce the refund guarantee we might lose all or part of our investment. Additionally we might fail to comply with our obligations towards the charterer.

Advance payments are made to the shipyards and these payments are secured by refund guarantees. Progress of the construction and compliance with all technical and regulatory specifications is closely monitored by our technical teams at the shipyards.

FINANCING

EXMAR is subject to restrictions on credit agreements, such as financial covenants and restrictions for EXMAR and its subsidiaries to take on further debts, distribute dividends, undertake certain investments, sell part of its business without the consent of its lenders.

The existing financing arrangements for our fleet are secured by the vessels and parent company guarantees and contain restrictions and other covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities. Any default could result in the acceleration of the maturity date and lenders could call on the guarantees of these facilities.

Our cash flows and our financial position, including the requirements under the financing agreements, are continuously monitored. Our financing strategy aims for a diversification of financing resources and a spread of maturity dates. A dialogue is maintained with different investors and financial partners in order to build a long-term relationship. As of 31 December 2018, all applicable financial covenants under the financing arrangements are complied with.

IMPAIRMENT

Negative variations in the fair market value of our fleet and other floating assets.

A significant decline in the fair value of our fleet could lead to an impairment loss to be recognized and would have a significant impact on our financial position and result. The ratio of the fair value of our fleet compared to the outstanding debt is a financial covenant in our financing arrangements. Our activities tend to be cyclical resulting in changes in the overall fair value of the fleet on the short-term. A significant decline could trigger an event of default under such arrangements.

The value of our fleet is continuously monitored using internal and external information and at least on each reporting date our fleet is tested for impairment. Testing is done by comparing the carrying amount of our fleet to appraisals of independent shipping brokers and to the net present value of the expected operating cash flows. The operating cash flows are based on internal information and a sensitivity analysis is performed on each assumption. Based on the testing performed as of December 31 2018 it is concluded that the carrying amount of our fleet is recoverable and that all financial covenants under our financing arrangements are complied with.

Financial obligations and working capital requirements can vary depending upon a number of factors.

Our cash generating activities can be cyclical and dependent upon market circumstances while our outgoing cash flows can relate to operating, investing or financing activities. Any failure to meet our financial obligations could have material consequences for our operations and could trigger events of default under certain arrangements.

Liquidity is managed on a continuous basis to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations when due under normal and stressed conditions. Based on our known contractual rights & obligations and using estimates or assumptions if needed, a monthly cash flow forecast is prepared and monitored per segment and for at least the subsequent 12 months. Our sources of operating income as well as our sources of financing are diversified. Payments relating to investing activities and our maturities of bank and other loans are also spread over different years.

4. REMUNERATIONS POLICY FOR THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee including the CEO consists of:
4.1 FIXED ANNUAL SALARY The scale of the fixed remuneration for members of the Executive Committee, including the executive directors, is linked to the function performed by the person concerned, his responsibilities and competencies. The remuneration is determined on the basis of the remunerations of a reference group consisting of a number of comparable enterprises in the maritime industry. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee can, if necessary, call on an independent external consultant.
Once a year the various compensation components for the members of the Executive Committee (including the CEO) are evaluated by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and tested against conditions in the market.

4.2 VARIABLE REMUNERATION The short-term variable remuneration (annual bonus) rewards members of the Executive Committee for achieving performance criteria and the amount is expressed as a percentage of the fixed annual remuneration. The evaluation period is the financial year.
The variable payment depends on the Company's results, as well as on other factors such as the performance of the individual, future prospects, the market situation, exceptional contribution(s) and/or special projects.
The variable remuneration is linked to developments in the results and to the specific evaluation and the performance of each individual. The Board of Directors can deviate from this and decide to award a bonus to a member of the Executive Committee on the basis of other objective criteria.

The Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on 17 May 2011 decided on the application of the provision of article 520ter of the Code of Companies and waived the staggering of the payment of the variable remuneration of the members of the executive committee. The decision on the application of this dispensation was delegated by the Shareholders' Meeting to the Board of Directors.
If the result deviates substantially from the basis on which the variable remuneration of the members of the Executive Committee is calculated, the Board of Directors can decide to revise the variable part of the remuneration and if need be to reclaim that part.

54

FINANCIAL REPORT

4.3 LONG TERM INCENTIVE (LTI) EXMAR works towards creation of sustainable economic value by means of long-term remuneration. This ensures that the interests of the members of the Executive Committee are more in line with those of shareholders and that they remain bound to the Company.
The long-term remuneration consists of a share option plan for existing EXMAR shares. The options can only be exercised after a period of 3 years.

In the event that a member of the Executive Committee resigns or is dismissed for compelling reasons by EXMAR the right to exercise the options lapses.
The amounts of share options offered are every year approved by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The granting of stock options is not linked to pre-determined and objectively quantifiable performance criteria.

4.4 INSURANCE PACKAGE The members of the Executive Committee with self-employed or employed status benefit from group insurance (type individual pension benefits for the self-employed) as well as guaranteed income insurance, accident insurance, hospitalisation insurance and travel insurance.
4.5 OTHER COMPENSATION COMPONENTS The members of the Executive Committee receive a company car, a cell phone and meal cheques.

FINANCIAL REPORT

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

Dear shareholders,
The Board of Directors submits for your approval the statutory and consolidated financial statements of EXMAR NV (the "Company") for the year ended 31 December 2018. It's drawn up in accordance with articles 96 and 119 of the Belgian Companies Code.

Under the provisions of the Royal Decree of 14 November 2017 regarding the duties of issuers of financial instruments admitted to trading on the Belgian regulated market, the Company is required to publish its annual financial report.
The elements that are applicable to the Company as provided by the regulations mentioned above, as well as in the Companies Code, are addressed

in the present financial statements, and also in the annual report under the Corporate Governance Statement.
This annual report should be read together with EXMAR's report on 2018.

1. THE STATUTORY ACCOUNTS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH BELGIAN GAAP

SHARE CAPITAL The share capital of the company amounts to USD 88,811,667 and is represented by 59,500,000 no-par-value shares. All shares have been paid up in full. The capital has not changed during the previous financial year.
Notwithstanding the provisions laid down in Article 125 of the Companies Code, the capital and the accounting are expressed in US dollars. This derogation was granted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and was confirmed in writing on 2 July 2003. The Board of Directors believes that the reasons for which this derogation was requested still apply to the financial statements for the period under discussion.
During the past financial year, no capital changes have occurred that must be reported in accordance with article 608 of the Companies Code.
COMMENTARY ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The statutory result for the financial year amounts to USD 10.2 million (USD 111.1 million in 2017).
Operating expenses decreased compared to 2017 with USD 1.3 million, mainly due to a decrease of a provision. The provision in respect of the PSA claim against CMB (for which EXMAR provided 39% of the estimated exposure following the partial demerger from CMB) has been released in the statement of profit or loss during 2018 as a consequence of a confirmation from PSA that the litigation has been terminated.

Financial income decreased with USD 108.5 million in comparison with 2017, this is mainly due to the sale of subsidiary Belgibo (including CMC Belgibo) to JLT and the sale of joint-ventures Excelerate, Explorer and Express to Excelerate Energy in 2017.
Financial expenses decreased compared to 2017 with USD 9.2 million, mainly due to the sale of Excelerate, Explorer and Express to Excelerate Energy in 2017. The three LNG companies each owned an LNG regasification vessel. These vessels were financed via shareholder's loans from EXMAR NV and Excelerate Energy. EXMAR NV financed these shareholder's loans with bank loans.
At the end of 2018, the total assets amounted to USD 736.8 million (USD 762.7 million at the end of 2017), including USD 619.2 million financial fixed assets (USD 674 million in 2017).
Shareholder's equity amounted to USD 659.2 million at the end of 2018 (USD 649 million in 2017). The increase of USD 10.2 million is the effect of the profit of the financial year 2018 for the same amount.
Total liabilities at the end of 2018 amounted to USD 77.3 million (USD 110.9 million at the end of 2017), of which USD 77.3 million short-term debt (USD 110.9 million short-term debt at the end of 2017). The decrease in the debt can be mainly explained by decreased intercompany financing.

The 2018 statutory annual accounts show a profit of USD 10.2 million. Including the results carried forward from the previous financial years, an amount of USD 274.2 million is available for appropriation.
APPROPRIATION OF THE RESULT The Board will propose to the General Shareholders' Meeting to appropriate the result for the year as follows:
Profit brought forward: USD 260,335,643.17 Profit of the period: USD 10,179,827.58 Transfer from the reserves not available for distribution: USD 3,662,312.26 Result to be carried forward : USD 274,177,783.01
Following this appropriation, the shareholders' equity of USD 659,229,639.35 will be composed as follows:
Capital: USD 88,811,667.00 Issue premium: USD 209,901,923.77 Reserves: USD 86,338,265.57 Retained earnings: USD 274,177,783.01

Below commentary on the consolidated financial statements is based on the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.
In 2018, EXMAR Group achieved a consolidated result of USD -16.1 million (USD 28 million in 2017).
Revenue increased in comparison with 2017 (USD 7.1 million). This increase can be explained by the LNG segment as a consequence of the start of the Gunvor contract for the FSRU and by increased engineering services in the Offshore segment.
The capital gain on the sales of assets amounted to USD 30.9 million and mainly relates to the sale of joint-venture Excelsior to Excelerate Energy end of January 2018.
The other operating income increased compared to 2017 with USD 6.9 million. This increase can be mainly explained by the settlement fee between EXMAR and PT JAWA SATU POWER as a consequence of the parties' inability to agree on the terms of EXMAR's involvement as FSRU partner and FSRU shipmanager. Another explanation for the increase is a license fee which was granted and which represents the right to use the EXMAR design for the construction, delivery, ownership and operation of an EXMAR OPTI® -11,000 Semi-Submersible Hull as an oil & gas floating production unit.

Operating expenses decreased compared to 2017 with USD 11.4 million, mainly as a consequence of the fees paid to Wison in respect of the CARIBBEAN FLNG in 2017. The effect of these fees has been partially compensated by increased depreciations as a consequence of the depreciations for the TANGO FLNG and the FSRU, which started during 2018.
The net finance result for 2018 amounted to USD -21 million (2017: USD -40 million). The movement can be mainly explained by the impairment loss registered on the shareholders' loan to Monteriggioni in 2017.
The share of result of equity accounted investees amounted to USD -1.6 million (USD 18.7 million in 2017). This decrease can be amongst others explained by the LNG sale to Excelerate Energy in 2017.
The vessels amounted to USD 564.4 million and comprise the LPG pressurized fleet, the CFLNG and the FSRU.
The investment in equity accounted investees amounted to USD 104.5 million (2017: USD 104.4 million) and consists of our share in the different joint ventures and associates.

Borrowings to equity accounted investees amounted to USD 49.3 million (2017: USD 58.9 million) and comprise the shareholder loans granted to our LPG and offshore equity accounted investees. The decrease compared to 2017 is amongst others caused by a partial repayment of one of the loans.
The net cash position (cash and cash equivalents reduced by overdrafts at financial institutions) on 31 December 2018 amounted to USD 39.8 million (USD 41.8 million in 2017). The restricted cash relates to credit facilities and amounted to USD 67.3 million per 31 December 2018 (USD 67.4 million in 2017).
Total equity amounted to USD 462.8 million on 31 December 2018 (2017: USD 477.5 million). This decrease in 2018 is mainly caused by the loss of 2018.
The financial debt amounted to USD 386.9 million on 31 December 2018 and increased by USD 14.2 million compared to 2017. The financial debt primarily increased as a consequence of the partial refinancing of the LPG pressurized fleet.

3. RISK FACTORS
The risks and uncertainties are described in the Corporate Governance Statement.

4. CONTINUITY STATEMENT

In view of the fact that no accumulated loss is shown on the balance sheet and that the income statement shows no loss for the financial year for two consecutive years, there is no need to justify the application of the going-concern accounting principle in accordance with article 96 of the Companies Code.
However, the Board of directors would like to make reference to section "significant judgements and estimates" of EXMAR's financial report were the use of the going concern principle is justified.

The Company is of the opinion that, taking into account its available cash, cash equivalents (including undrawn committed credit lines and release of restricted cash under the TANGO FLNG financing) and financing and re-financing assumptions, it has sufficient liquidity to meet its present obligations and cover its working capital needs for a period of at least 12 months. The Company met all its financial covenants as at 31 December 2018.
The next testing date with respect to the financial position as at the end of June 2019 is in September 2019. In the event of a breach of cove-

nants the Company is confident that a waiver will be obtained from the relevant lenders. The Company is looking to refinance, partly or fully, its existing bond (approximately USD 121.4 million) which is falling due on 7 July 2019. The Company believes that there is appetite for such refinancing; however no commitments have been made. DNB Markets, Nordea and Pareto Securities have been mandated in relation to a bond issue which may follow.

(*) The Board of Directors meeting of 23 March 2009 decided to extend the original exercise period for the first four option plans by five years, by virtue of the decision by the Belgian Government to extend the Act of 26 March 1999, in particular regarding stock option plans. (°) As a result of the capital increase of November 2009, the dilution protection and extra dividend of May 2012, the number and exercise price of the stock options was modified.

JUSTIFICATION OF THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The accounting principles applied at the closing of the statutory financial statements do not differ from the accounting principles that were applied in the previous financial year. The summary of the accounting principles is attached to the annual financial statements.
For the consolidated financial statements, we refer to page 68 to 77 of this financial report. More specifically, the change in accounting po licies is explained in section E on page 69 of this financial report as a consequence of the first time application of IFRS 9 and 15.
EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE The significant events occurred after the closing of the financial year 2018 are disclosed in note 37 of the consolidated financial statements.

OFFICES AND BRANCHES Besides the Head Office in Antwerp (Belgium), EXMAR has offices in Hong Kong, Houston, London, Limassol, Luxembourg, Mumbai, Paris, Singapore, the Netherlands, Duisburg, Kingston and Livorno.
EXMAR has branches in Shanghai, Pointe Noir and Angola.
ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR The Statutory Auditor did not carry out any exceptional activities or special assignments during the past financial year.
USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The long-term vision, that is typical of EXMAR's activities, is accompanied by long-term financing and therefore EXMAR's activities are also exposed to floating interest rates. EXMAR actively manages this exposure and if deemed appropriate could cover itself for rising interest

rates for a part of its debt portfolio by means of various instruments.
EXMAR successfully closed a NOK 700 million senior unsecured bond issue in 2014 and issued an additional NOK 300 million in 2015. The bond has been amended and extended in June 2017 and has a maturity date in July 2019.
EXMAR operates in USD but has to settle certain annual costs in Euros. The EUR/USD exposure is managed by means of hedging instruments if deemed necessary. At the date of this report EXMAR has no cover of EUR/USD exposure.
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 523 OF THE CODE OF COMPANIES During the financial year of 2018, there was no application of Article 523 of the Code of Companies.
There were no conflicts of interest as far as the Executive Committee is concerned.

FINANCIAL REPORT

OUTLOOK 2019

LPG: In March 2018 EXMAR announced it had contracted two VLGC Newbuildings at Hanjin Heavy Indus¬tries & Construction at Subic Bay (Philippines). In January 2019 Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction filed for rehabilitation due to financial difficulties. The construction disruptions caused thereby obliged EXMAR to cancel both Shipbuilding Contracts and invoke the Refund Guarantees from Korean Development Bank to recover each of the Instalments already paid. In order to fulfil its long-term commitments towards Equinor ASA of Norway and further dedicate its resources to innovative shipping solutions, EXMAR is currently in advanced negotiations with a shipyard to secure replacement vessels. The Midsize market showed signs of an increasing recovery in the beginning of 2019 but quickly suffered from the lack of employment on the VLGCs. Whilst having a solid backbone of 79 % cover for 2019, the forward fixing strategy of EXMAR is paying off as those fixing are done above current market terms. EXMAR's 20-strong Midsize fleet and diverse client portfolio remains well-placed to take advantage of an improving market environment. Continued tight spot market conditions and a limited order book maintain a solid outlook for the Pressurized vessel segment. EXMAR's fleet is entirely booked for 2019. Rewarding new prospects as well as opportunities to extend current charters are therefore expected to positively impact future earnings. The successful

refinancing operation on EXMAR's Pressurized fleet will be completed in April 2019.
LNG Shipping: The debt on the EXCALIBUR has been successfully refinanced until the end of her time charter, guarantying a stable income in the coming years, putting EXMAR in a position to take advantage of new LNG shipping opportunities as they arise.
Floating Regasification: The FSRU barge, contracted to Gunvor last year is currently still at Keppel Shipyard, Singapore.
The FSRU is on hire as from October 2018. EXMAR has reached an agreement in principle for the financing of the FSRU barge.
Floating Liquefaction: The Tango Floating Liquefaction of Natural Gas ("TFLNG") arrived on 4 February in Bahia Blanca Argentina. The commissioning of the unit has started mid-March and EXMAR's management remains comfortable that the unit will be able to start its gas liquefaction operations in the second quarter of 2019 at which time a significant portion of the restricted cash under the financing of TFLNG will be released. The yearly production of about 500,000 tons LNG will account for an estimated annual EBITDA of USD 43.0 million per year with a potential upside depending on the market environment and the actual production of the unit.

Offshore: EXMAR Offshore Houston was awarded a contract for the construction of an OPTI® floating production semisubmersible for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico. This new order is a significant achievement for EXMAR at time when only a handful of projects have been sanctioned in recent years. This will be the third production system to be installed in the Gulf of Mexico based on EXMAR's proprietary design. Additionally, EXMAR continues to perform early conceptual design work for a number of potential developments in the Gulf of Mexico based on the highly successful OPTI®- Series semisubmersible design. The NUNCE accommodation work barge will remain under firm employment with Sonangol P&P, offshore Angola, until the end of the second quarter 2022. The WARIBOKO accommodation work barge continues to be employed by Total E&P, offshore Nigeria, and will be employed until the mid-2019.
All information which pursuant to Article 96(2) of the Companies Code must be included in the present annual report of the Board of Directors, more particularly the Corporate Governance Statement and the requirements of Article 34 of the Royal Decree of 14 November 2007, is shown under the chapter `Corporate Governance Statement', under the chapter `Risk Factors', and by reference thereto included in the present annual report.

FINANCIAL REPORT

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A. REPORTING ENTITY EXMAR nv ("the Company") is a company domiciled in Belgium whose shares are publicly traded (Euronext ­ EXM). The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the Company, its subsidiaries, and the Group's interest in associates and joint arrangements (referred to as "The Group"). The Group is active in the industrial shipping business.
B. BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by EU on 31/12/2018.
The group has adopted the following new standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with a date of initial application of 1 January 2018.
· IFRS 9 Financial instruments · IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with cus-
tomers
We refer to section E Changes in accounting policies.
The Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRS Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are effective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2018. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
· Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
· Amendments to IAS 40 Transfer of investment property
· Annual improvements to IFRS's 2014-2016 cycle
· Foreign currency transactions and Advance consideration (IFRIC 22)
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements:
IFRS 16 Leasing: In January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard for lease accounting, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The standard has been

endorsed by the European Union. IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases for a lessee and introduces a single lease accounting model for lessees. All leases, except leases with a term of lease less than twelve months or low-value leases, are capitalized by recognizing the present value of the lease payments and presenting them as a right of use asset in the statement of financial position of the lessee. IFRS 16 does not change substantially lease accounting for lessors. A lessor will continue to classify leases as either operational or finance lease and account for those two types of leases differently.
The Group has chosen the modified retrospective application of IFRS 16 in accordance with IFRS 16 C5 (b). Consequently, the Group will not restate the comparative information. The Group will make use of the practical expedient available on transition to IFRS 16 not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered or modified before 1 January 2019. The change in definition of a lease mainly relates to the concept of control. IFRS 16 distinguishes between leases and service contracts on the basis of whether the use of an identified asset is controlled by the customer.
The Group has investigated the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the consolidated financial statements.
LEASES IN WHICH THE GROUP IS A LESSEE The Group will recognize new assets and liabilities for its operating lease of vessels, office buildings and others (see note 30 of the financial annual report). The nature of expenses related to those leasing's will now change because the Group will recognize a depreciation charge for the right of use assets and interest expenses on lease liabilities.
Previously, the Group recognized operating lease expenses on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between the actual lease payment and the expense recognized.
No significant impact is expected for the Group's finance leases.

Based on the information currently available, the Group estimates that it will recognize additional lease liabilities of USD 14.3 million as at 1 January 2019 in our equity consolidation (USD 54.1 million in our proportionate consolidation). The Group does not expect that the adoption of IFRS 16 will impact its ability to comply with the existing loan covenants.
LEASES IN WHICH THE GROUP IS A LESSOR No significant impact is expected for leases where the Group is a lessor.
The following new or amended standards or interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
· Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28).
· IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts · Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
(IFRIC 23). · Long-term interest in Associates and Joint
Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28). · Annual improvements to IFRS 2015-2017
cycle · Amendments to IAS 19: plan amendment,
curtailment or settlement · Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment features
with negative compensation · Amendments to References to the Conceptual
Framework in IFRS Standards · Amendments to IFRS 3 Business combina-
tions · Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition
of Material
The consolidated financial statements were approved and were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on March 28, 2019.
C. FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY The consolidated accounts are presented in USD in accordance with the deviation granted by the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) by letter of 2 July 2003, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand. USD is the Company's functional currency. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material assets and liabilities that have been measured on an alternative basis on each reporting date: derivative financial instruments, equity securities at FVTPL and the net defined benefit liability. Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.

FINANCIAL REPORT

D. USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision only affects that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has made judgements, estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value for the share options, the employee benefit plans, provisions and contingencies and the classification of new lease commitments and time charter agreements. On a yearly basis the residual value and the useful life of the vessels is reviewed.
The carrying values of the vessels may not represent the fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of new buildings. Historically, both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical. The carrying amounts of each specific fleet are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a specific fleet may not be fully recoverable. The recoverable amount is the highest of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use. The fair value less cost to sell is determined based upon independent valuation reports. The value in use is based upon future cash flows discounted to their present value. In developing estimates of future cash flows, we must make assumptions about future charter rates, ship operating expenses, the estimated remaining useful lives of the fleet and the WACC. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. Although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective.
A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial

assets and liabilities. When measuring the fair value, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques:
· Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
· Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
· Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
E. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Group has initially applied IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in July 2014 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements, which align hedge accounting more closely with risk management.
PHASE 1: CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES With respect to the classification and measurement, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS has been reduced; all recognized financial assets that are currently within the scope of IAS 39 will be subsequently measured at either amortized cost or fair value under IFRS 9. Specially:
· A debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and (ii) has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding must be measured at amortized costs (net of any write down of impairment), unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option.
· A debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and (ii) has contractual terms that give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and

interest on the principal amount outstanding must be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option. · All other debt instruments must be measured at FTPL. · All equity instruments are to be measured in the statement of financial position at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss except that if an equity investment is not held for trading, nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies, an irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition to measure the investment at FVTOCI, with di vidend income recognized in profit or loss.
IFRS 9 eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sales.
IFRS 9 also contains requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and derecognition requirements. One major difference from IAS 39 relates to the presentation of changes in the fair value of a financial liability designated as at FVTPL attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability. Under IFRS 9, such changes are presented in other comprehensive income, unless the presentation of the effect of the change in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability's credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Under IAS 39, the entire amount of the change in fair value of the financial liability designated as FVTPL is presented in profit or loss.
The Group has applied the new requirements under IFRS 9. These new classification and measurement requirements did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements, except for the renaming of the "Available-for-sale financial assets" to "Equity securities - measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)". On the face of the balance sheet, the former " Available-for-sale financial assets" have been presented as "Other investments". The accounting policies and disclosures have been adjusted to reflect the new terminology and requirements of IFRS 9.
PHASE 2: IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credit losses, as opposed to incurred credit losses under IAS 39. Under the impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is no longer necessary

69

FINANCIAL REPORT

for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses should be updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
The new impairment model did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in note 29 of the consolidated financial statements, no important impairment losses have occurred in the past and no important credit losses are expected by management.
PHASE 3: HEDGE ACCOUNTING The general hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 retain the three types of hedge accounting mechanisms under IAS 39. However, greater flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, specially broadening the types of instruments that qualify as hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items that are eligible for hedge accounting. In addition, the effectiveness test has been overhauled and replaced with the principle of an "economic relationship". Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is no longer required.
When initially applying IFRS 9, the Group may choose as its accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the requirements in IFRS 9. The Group has chosen to apply the new requirements of IFRS 9.
The types of hedge accounting relationships that the Group currently designates meet the requirements of IFRS 9 and are aligned with the entity's risk management strategy and objective.
The application of IFRS 9 hedge accounting did not have an impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related interpretations.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, the

Standard introduces a 5-step approach for revenue recognition:
· Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer · Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract · Step 3: Determine the transaction price · Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the
performance obligations in the contract · Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the
entity satisfies a performance obligation
Under IFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when `control' of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
The Group recognizes revenue from the following major sources:
· Time or bareboat charter revenue: revenue is recognized on an accrual basis and in recorded over the term of the charter as the service is provided. This type of revenue falls within the scope of IAS 17/ IFRS 16 Leasing (see above) and represents 44.4% of total revenue.
· Service revenue: the Group is involved in performing specialized supporting services to the oil and gas industry (this type of revenue represents 55.6% of total revenue):
 - S hipmanagement services: in accordance with IFRS 15, the performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance as the entity performs (recurring services).
 - T ravel agency services: in accordance with IFRS 15, the Group acts as an agent for the services provided. As a consequence, the Group recognizes revenue not on a gross basis, but only recognizes to which it expects to be entitled to.
The Group has applied the new requirements under IFRS 15, the new standard did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies and disclosures have been adjusted to reflect the new terminology and requirements of IFRS 15.
F. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of consolidation
Business combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.

A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed to provide a return to investors (or other owners, members or participants) by way of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits. A business generally consists of inputs, processes applied on those inputs and the ability to create outputs. This can for instance be the case when the acquisition also contains the transfer of current contracts in respect of chartering, crew,...
The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. The group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. All intra-Group balances, income and expenses, unrealized gains and losses and dividends resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full.
Loss of control Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognized in profit and loss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such

70

FINANCIAL REPORT

interest is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost.
Interests in equity-accounted investees The Group's interest in equity accounted investees comprises interests in associates and joint ventures.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power.
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.
When the share of the Group in the losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to zero, and the recognition of future losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. In such case the negative investment in equity accounted investees is deducted from other components of the investor's interest in the equity accounted investee (borrowings to equity accounted investees). If the negative investment in equity accounted investees exceeds the investor's interest, a liability is recognized for the net amount. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
b) Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are converted to the respective functional currencies at the exchange rate applicable at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denomi-

nated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to USD at the exchange rate applicable at that date. The non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated to USD at the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit or loss statement, except for qualified cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial statements of foreign operations Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to USD using the closing rate at reporting date.
The income and expenses of the foreign operations are converted to USD at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction (the average exchange rate during the relevant period is used in case the date of transaction approximates this average rate).
Foreign currency differences are recognized directly in other comprehensive income. These foreign currency differences are presented within the translation reserve. However, if the operation is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit and loss.
c) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are re cognised in the Group's statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial assets All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost:
· the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and
· the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): · the financial asset is held within a business
model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and · the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
By default, all other financial assets are mea sured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Despite the foregoing, the Group may make the following irrevocable election/designation at initial recognition of a financial asset:
· the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment in other comprehensive income if certain criteria are met (see (iii) below); and

71

FINANCIAL REPORT

· the Group may irrevocably designate a debt investment that meets the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch (see (iv) below).
All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.
(i) Financial assets at amortised costs These assets are subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.
(ii) Debt investments at FVTOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income is calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.
(iii) Equity investments at FVTOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.
(iv) Financial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. However, see section derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting for derivatives designated as hedging instruments.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control over the financial asset.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability

is classified at FVTPL if it is classified as heldfor-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.
See section derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting for derivatives designated as hedging instruments.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.
On derecognition of a financial liability, the diffe rence between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any noncash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.
Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of tax effects. When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs net of tax, is recognised as a deduction from equity. When treasury shares are sold, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in retained earnings.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk

exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are recognized at fair value and changes therein are generally recognized in profit and loss.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates and certain derivatives and non-derivative financial liabilities as hedges of foreign exchange risk of a net investment in a foreign operation.
At inception of designated hedge relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedged instrument, including whether the changes is cash flow of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.
Cash flow hedges When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is rec ognized in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognized in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is rec ognized immediately in profit or loss. The amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of the hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedge expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in de cash flow hedge reserve at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecasted transaction occurs. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in the cash flow hedge

72

FINANCIAL REPORT

reserve is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.
d) Goodwill Goodwill arising upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Company's interest in the recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabi lities of the acquiree. When the excess was ne gative, a bargain purchase gain was recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisition.
Subsequently goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on such an investment is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee as a whole.
e) Intangible assets
Research and development

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially new improved products and processes. Development cost is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets (e.g. software,...) acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisations and accumulated impairment losses. The amortisation is recognized in the profit or loss statement, and is spread over the useful life of the relevant intangible assets following the straightline depreciation method. The amortization starts from the date that they are available for use. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or that are not yet available for use, are subject to an annual impairment test.
Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific assets to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
f) Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, which includes capitalised borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and capitalized borrowing costs.

Subsequent expenses associated with items of property, plant and equipment are capitalised only if a future economic advantage will result from this expenditure and its cost can be mea sured reliably. If a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is replaced, the replacement cost is capitalised and the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the profit or loss statement as incurred.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, less its residual value and is recognized in profit or loss.

Vessels or units in the construction process are separately classified on the balance sheet as vessels under construction. These vessels under construction are not depreciated, depreciation starts at the moment that the vessels are delivered. As from the moment of delivery, the vessels are no longer classified as under construction. The business model of the Group aims to rent or operate the constructed assets.

The vessels are depreciated on a straight-line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful life in the Group. The residual value amounts to USD 0 for all vessels and platforms.

IT equipment:

33%

The method of depreciation, the residual value, and the useful life values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.

Leased assets Lease agreements substantially assigning all risks and rewards inherent to ownership to the Group, are classified as finance leases. The leased assets measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, are subsequently reduced by the accumulated depreciation and possible impairment losses. The depreciation period matches the useful life. If there is uncertainty with respect to the transfer of ownership to the Group at the end of the contract, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life.

g) Investment property

Investment property is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The depreciation is recognized in the profit or loss statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the investment properties.

h) Impairment of assets

Equity accounted investees After application of the equity method, the entity determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss with respect to its net investment in the associate or joint venture. An impairment loss in respect of an equity-accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss and is reversed when there is a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Non-financial assets The carrying value of non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated on each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit (CGU) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
i) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets (or components of a disposal group) are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter the assets (or disposal group) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis except that no loss is allocated to assets not in the measurement scope of IFRS 5, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's other accounting policies. Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment property once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of equity-accounted investees ceases once classified as held for sale or distribution.
j) Employee benefits

Financial assets Financial assets measured at cost Financial assets measured at cost are assessed each reporting date to determine whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (ECL's). When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating lifetime ECL's, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.

The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. All impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss statement.
Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.

Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss statement as the related service is provided.
Defined benefit plans The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in

74

FINANCIAL REPORT

the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net Interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Belgian defined contribution plans with return guaranteed by law Belgian defined contribution plans are subject to the Law of April 28, 2003 on occupational pensions (hereafter `the WAP'). According to article 24 of this Law, the employer has to guarantee an average minimum return of 3.75% on employee contributions and of 3.25% on employer contributions and this for contributions paid until 31/12/2015. As from January 2016, the employer has to guarantee an average minimum return of 1,75% on both employer and employee contributions (as changed by the Law of 18 December 2015). This guaranteed minimum return generally exceeds the return that is normally gua ranteed by the insurer. Because the employer has to guarantee the statutory minimum return on these plans, not all actuarial and investment risks relating to these plans are transferred to the insurance company managing the plans. Therefore these plans do not meet the definition of defined contribution plan under IFRS and have to be classified by default as defined benefit plans. An actuarial calculation has been performed in accordance with IAS 19 based on the projected unit credit method.

Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility or withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting date, then they are discounted to their present value.
Short-term employee benefit Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees uncondi tionally become entitled to the options. The amounts recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of options for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at vesting date.
k) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as result of a past event, that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Restructuring provisions Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal

restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the una voidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
l) Income
Revenues from assets sold and services rendered The company and/ or its joint ventures generate revenues from charterers for the use of its assets. Assets are chartered using voyage/spot, time or bareboat charters. For voyage/spot charters, a contract is closed in the spot market for the use of an asset for a specific voyage at a contractual agreed rate per metric tonnes transported. For time or bareboat charters, a contract is entered into for the use of an asset for a specific period of time at a contractual agreed daily or monthly rate. Revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the duration of each voyage, time or bareboat charter. Invoices and related payment terms depend on individual contractual terms.
Revenue from the sale of assets is recognised in the profit or loss statement when control of the goods underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer. For the sale of a vessel, control is transferred to the customer at the moment that the vessel is delivered to the customer. Invoices and related payment terms depend on individual contractual terms.
Revenue from services is recognised in the profit or loss statement over time as the services are provided. The amount of revenue to recognise is assessed based on the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. Invoices and related payment terms depend on individual contractual terms.
Commissions: if the group acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as a principal in the transaction, then the revenue recognised is the net amount of commission made by the Group.

75

FINANCIAL REPORT

Rental income from investment property is recognised in the profit or loss statement on a straightline basis over the term of the lease agreement.
m) Leases
Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease.
At inception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Group separates payments and other considerations required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair value. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that it is impractible to separate the payments reliably, than an asset and a liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset. Subsequently, the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance cost on the liability is recognised.
Leased assets Leases of assets that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. The leased assets are measured initially at the lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Assets held under other leases are classified as an operating lease and are not recognised in the statement of financial position.
Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments made as lessee under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The Group does not have financial lease contracts acting as lessor.

Contingent lease payments are accounted for in profit or loss except when they relate to future benefits in which case the minimum lease payments are revised over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed.
n) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant and are then recognised in profit and loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.
o) Finance income and expenses
Finance income consists of interests received, dividend income, gains on the disposal of equity securities at FVTPL, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, and gains on hedging instruments that are re cognised in profit or loss and exchange rate gains. Interest income is recognised in the profit or loss statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset. Dividend income is recognised in the profit or loss statement on the date that the dividend is declared.
Finance expenses consist of interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, impairment losses recognised on financial assets, exchange rate losses and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss.
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis per currency as either other finance income or finance expense.
p) Taxes
Income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred tax is re cognized in the profit or loss statement, except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or when they relate to items that are recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss of the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is pro bable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced when it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that is has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain conditions are met.
Tonnage tax is not accounted for as income taxes in accordance with IAS 12 and is not presented as part of income tax expense in the profit or loss statement but is shown under other operating expenses.
q) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

76

FINANCIAL REPORT

The result for each segment includes all income and expenses generated directly by this segment, as well as part of the income and expenses that can reasonably be allocated to this segment. The assets and liabilities allocated to a segment include as a minimum the assets and liabilities which are periodically reported to the Chief operating decision maker, being the Group's CEO and the Executive Committee.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.
r) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the

Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for treasury shares held. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit and loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for treasury shares held and for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares such as share options granted to employees.
s) Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale; is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or

geographic area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale. Classification of a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued ope ration, the comparative profit or loss statement is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

2. SEGMENT REPORTING (IN THOUSANDS OF USD)
In respect of joint-ventures, the company continues to manage its operations based on internal management reports applying the principles of the p roportionate consolidation method. The reconciliation of the segment reporting to the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of profit or loss is presented in note 3. All differences relate to the application of IFRS 11 Joint arrangements, no other differences exist.
The Group has 4 reportable segments. The Group's operating segments reflect the level at which the Group's CEO and the Executive Committee review the business and make decisions about the allocation of resources and other operating matters. These segments offer different products and services and are managed separately.
· The LPG segment includes transportation of Liquid Petroleum Gas, ammonia and other petrochemical gases through the Midsize, VLGC and pressurised fleet. The LPG fleet is reported as one segment taken into account the similar characteristics of the fleet (eg nature of the products,...).
· Transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas and LNG Infrastructure activities and assets are comprised in the LNG segment. · The activities in the offshore industry through the supply of services and equipment are allocated to the Offshore segment. · The segment Services and corporate include the specialised supporting services such as shipmanagement services and travel agency services.
The company's internal and management structure does not distinguish any geographical segments as the company's fleet is operated on a worldwide basis. The intra-segment revenue mainly relates to management and crew services provided.
Major LNG client Excelerate Energy Llc represents 59% (98% in 2017) of the revenue of the LNG segment revenue and 7% (29% in 2017) of the EXMAR Group revenue in 2018. The remaining part of the LNG revenue is divided between 2 different customers. Major LPG client Equinor (ex-Statoil) represents 27.3% (24% in 2017) of the revenue of the LPG segment and 16% (10% in 2017) of the EXMAR Group revenue in 2018. The remaining part of the LPG revenue is divided between 22 different customers. No other customers represent more than 10% of the EXMAR group revenue in 2018.

29,879 0
16,793 33,978 80,650

The increase in total revenue in the LNG segment is mainly due to invoicing which started for the FSRU towards Gunvor.
The increase in total revenue in the Offshore segment can be mainly explained by increased engineering services, amongst others for the construction of an EXMAR Opti (see also other operating income in this respect).
The decrease in total revenue in the Services segment is mainly due to the sale of insurance broker Belgibo NV (including CMC Belgibo BVBA) to Jardine Lloyd Thomson Group plc (JLT), one of the world's leading providers of insurance, reinsurance and employee benefits related advice, brokerage and associated services, end of August 2017.
Major LPG client Equinor (ex-Statoil) represents 41.6% (35.6% in 2017) of the revenue of the LPG segment and 14.4% (11.4% in 2017) of the EXMAR Group revenue in 2018. No other customers represent more than 10% of the EXMAR group revenue in 2018.

Vessel operating expenses are expenses made to operate a vessel. Vessel operating expenses contain bareboat expenses, expenses related to crewing, maintenance, insurance,...and other vessel operating expenses like bunkers, port expenses,... The increase in the vessel operating expenses compared to 2017 can be amongst others explained by crewing and maintenance for the FSRU. Non-vessel operating expenses decreased compared to 2017, this is mainly caused by the fees paid to Wison Shipyard in respect of the CARIBBEAN FLNG (now renamed TANGO FLNG) in 2017. Non-vessel operating expenses include amongst others director fees, travel expenses, consulting fees, audit fees and office costs.

The interest income on borrowings to equity accounted investees relates to interests paid by these equity accounted investees on the borrowings provided by EXMAR. The decrease compared to 2017 can be mainly explained by the LNG sale in 2017, EXMAR provided borrowings to Excelerate, Explorer and Express. As a consequence of the sale, these borrowings have been settled. We refer in this respect to note 16.
Interest expenses relate to EXMAR's borrowings as disclosed in note 24.

DISPOSAL OF AN EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTEE IN 2017

On December 7, 2017 EXMAR has sold its 50% share in the LNG companies Excelerate NV, Explorer NV & Express NV to Excelerate Energy. The invest-

ments in these equity accounted investees have been derecognised from the balance sheet. The sale resulted in a gain of USD 70 million. The three

LNG companies each owned an LNG regasification vessel. These vessels were financed via shareholder's loans from EXMAR NV and Excelerate Energy.

EXMAR NV financed these shareholder's loans with bank loans.

A. CONSIDERATION RECEIVED
Consideration received in cash and cash equivalents Presentation in the consolidated Statement of Cash flows:

The consideration received amounts to EUR 328.3 million and includes the repayment of the shareholder's loans for an amount of USD 277.4 million. The outstanding bank loans for the vessels within EXMAR NV have been repaid with these proceeds. This repayment of USD 270.2 million is included in the cash flow statement under repayment of borrowings. The repayments from equity accounted investees and repayment of borrowings does not tie in with the amount mentioned in the cash flow statement as other repayments from equity accounted investees and other repayment of borrowings are included in the amounts in the cash flow statement.

(*) The advance payments in respect of vessels under construction have been presented under vessels in the consolidated statement of financial position. The advance payments made do not give EXMAR ownership rights on the vessels before their final delivery.
(**) The barge KISSAMA has been sold during April 2017. The gain realized on this sale amounted to USD 1.6 million.
(***) The CARIBBEAN FLNG has been delivered on 27 July 2017. The FSRU has been delivered on 21 December 2017. Both units have been transferred from vessels under construction to vessels in 2017. The CARIBBEAN FLNG has been renamed TANGO FLNG during 2018 as a consequence of the employment contract with YPF.
(****) During 2018, additional investments occured in respect of the TANGO FLNG and the FSRU. Depreciations on both units started in the course of 2018, they are depreciated over a period of 30 years.

The vessels are pledged as a security for the related underlying liabilities. We refer to note 24 for more information in respect of these underlying liabilities.

For the wholly-owned fleet, internal and external triggers are evaluated which indicate that the carrying value of this fleet should be tested for impairment. The carrying amount of the fleet is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.

91

FINANCIAL REPORT

The fair value less costs to sell is based upon the average fair market value as determined by two independent ship brokers. The value in use is based upon the estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value and reflecting current market assessments relating to freight rate estimates, employment and operating expenses. The operating cash flows are based on internal information and a sensitivity analysis is performed on each assumption. The discounted cash flow model used by management includes cash flows for the remaining lifetime of the wholly-owned fleet. Three year cash flow forecasts are estimated by management based upon the past experience as well as current market expectations regarding volumes and freight rates going forward. Freight rates as well as operating expenses subsequent to this three year period are expected to change in line with estimated inflation afterwards. The discount rate used is a weighted average cost of capital of 6.14% for the LPG segment and 6.36% for the LNG segment.

For the FSRU, a fair value calculation was obtained based on a valuation report of an independent ship broker. Based on this valuation report and expected earnings under its employment, management has concluded that no impairment correction is required for the FSRU barge.

For the jointly-owned fleet, impairment triggers are evaluated in the same way as for the wholly-owned fleet. We refer to note 14 for more information in this respect.

EXMAR has analysed the existing joint arrangements and has concluded that the existing joint arrangements are all joint ventures in accordance with IFRS 11 "joint arrangements".
EXMAR has provided guarantees to financial institutions that have provided credit facilities to her equity accounted investees. As of December 31, 2018, an amount of USD 635.4 million (2017: USD 641 million) was outstanding under such loan agreements, of which EXMAR has guaranteed USD 317.7 million (2017: USD 320.5 million). We refer in this respect also to note 29.
Following regulatory requirements or borrowing arrangements, our joint ventures or associates may be restricted to make cash distributions such as dividend payments or repayments of shareholder loans. Under the borrowing arrangements our joint ventures or associates may only make a distribution if no event of default or no breach of any covenant would result from such distribution. Under corporate law, dividend distributions are restricted if the net assets would be less than the amount of paid up capital plus any reserves that cannot be distributed.
For the jointly-owned fleet, impairment triggers are evaluated in the same way as for the wholly-owned fleet. We refer to note 11 for more information in this respect.

The Group's exposure to credit and currency risks and impairment losses related to trade and other receivables is disclosed in note 29.
The increase in other receivables is mainly due to the advance payments made for the building of 2 VLGC newbuildings to Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction. On 8th January 2019 Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction at Subic Bay (Philippines) filed for rehabilitation due to financial difficulties. The construction disruptions caused thereby obliged EXMAR to cancel both Shipbuilding Contracts and invoke the Refund Guarantee from Korean Development Bank (South Korea) to recover each of the Instalments already paid.

FINANCIAL REPORT
BANK LOANS
The bank loans mainly relate to the LPG pressurized facilities and the CARIBBEAN FLNG facility, now renamed TANGO FLNG facility.
LPG PRESSURIZED FACILITIES - USD 19.9 MILLION (2017: USD 59.4 MILLION) In October and December 2008, EXMAR closed 3 senior secured loan facilities for the financing of 10 pressurized LPG vessels. The loans are repayable in quarterly tranches and the applicable interest percentage amounts to three-month LIBOR plus 3% and three-month LIBOR plus 1%. Six vessels have already been refinanced in 2018, the remaining vessels will be refinanced in April 2019 (see NEW LPG pressurized facilities). All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV ("guarantor").
NEW LPG PRESSURIZED FACILITIES - USD 47.7 MILLION (2017: USD 0) In the last quarter of 2018, EXMAR refinanced its LPG pressurized fleet. Five vessels have been refinanced under this transaction in October 2018, one vessel has been refinanced in December 2018. The loans are repayable in quarterly tranches and the applicable interest percentage amounts to threemonth LIBOR plus 2.4%. The last repayment is foreseen in December 2025. The remaining 4 vessels will be refinanced in April 2019. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV ("guarantor").
TANGO FLNG FACILITY - USD 177.4 MILLION (2017: USD 187.5 MILLION) End of June 2017, EXPORT Lng Limited (a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV) has signed a financing agreement of USD 200 million with the Bank of China (Boc), Deutsche Bank and Sinosure for the financing of the TANGO FLNG. This loan has been drawn on 27 July 2017 at the time of the delivery of the CARIBBEAN FLNG, renamed TANGO FLNG. The agreement with BoC provides a repayment period of 12 years and the loan bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 3%. The yearly estimated debt service amounts to USD 26.7 million. There is a requirement for EXPORT to deposit an amount equal to 30 months principal plus interest, i.e. an amount of USD 67.4 million, on an escrow account. The Company reached an agreement in principle to partially release the cash currently trapped in this Debt Service Reserve Account: approximately USD 40 million after the first hire payment from YPF expected in May 2019 and an additional USD 13 million after one year of operations of TANGO FLNG. The documentation is being prepared and will be executed once the final approval of Sinosure has been obtained. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV ("guarantor").
OTHER LOANS
The other loans relate to a NOK 700 million senior unsecured bond issue. This bond was closed in July 2014 by EXMAR Netherlands BV ("issuer"), a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV. During 2015, an additional amount of NOK 300 million has been issued (second tranche on the original NOK 700 million bond). The total nominal amount outstanding amounts to NOK 1 billion with initial maturity date in July 2017. In June 2017, the term of the bond has been amended and extended until July 2019. As a consequence, the bond has been classified as a short term liability in the consolidated statement of financial position. As a consequence of the extension of the term of the bond, each bond holder had the possibility to exchange NOK bonds to USD bonds. The interest percentage applicable on the remaining NOK bonds amounts to three-month NIBOR plus a margin of 8%. The exchanged USD bonds bear an interest percentage of three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 8.5%. EXMAR has received instructions for exchanges which represents an amount of USD 15,622,732. EXMAR has a call option on the bond at anytime. The call option price and redemption price at maturity amounts to 105%. The call premium of 5% amounts to USD 6.1 million and has been registered in profit or loss during 2017. All obligations of the issuer are guaranteed by EXMAR NV ("guarantor"). EXMAR NV has to maintain direct or indirect a 100% ownership in the issuer. As per 31 December 2017, a forward exchange contract was outstanding to cover the NOK/USD exposure. Per 31 December 2018, no instrument was outstanding to cover the NOK/ USD exposure. We also refer to note 29 in this respect.
EXMAR's barge based FSRU was delivered end of December 2017. The unit was able to obtain a long-term contract with GUNVOR and its employment commenced in October of 2018. The last installment of the FSRU has been mainly financed with the proceeds of the sale of the three LNG companies (Explorer NV, Express NV and Excelerate NV). A term sheet has been signed with CSSC Hong Kong Shipping Company for the financing of the FSRU.
In general, the borrowings held by EXMAR and its equity accounted investees are secured by a mortgage on the underlying assets owned by EXMAR and its equity accounted investees. Furthermore, different pledges and other types of guarantees exist to secure the borrowings. In addition, dividend restrictions are included as a special covenant in the terms of the bond. EXMAR shall not declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind, that in aggregate exceed the higher of (i) 50% of the consolidated net profit after tax based on the audited consolidated financial statements for the previous financial year and (ii) EUR 0.30 per share. EXMAR has pledged financial assets as collateral for liabilities. We refer to note 21 where the amount of restricted cash in respect of financing agreements is disclosed.
Also different debt covenants exist that require compliance with certain financial ratio's. These ratio's are calculated semi-annually based on EXMAR's conso lidated figures in which equity accounted investees are not accounted for under IFRS 11 but still on a proportionate basis (similar to accounting policies used for segment reporting purposes). In case of non-compliance with these covenants, early repayment of related borrowings might be required. As of December 31, 2018 EXMAR was compliant with all covenants. EXMAR is continuously monitoring compliance with all applicable covenants.

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS (IN THOUSANDS OF USD)
The Group established a share option plan program that entitles certain employees to register for a number of shares. The share options are only exercisable after a period of three years and for employees still in service after this three year period. Each share option entitles the holder of the option to one EXMAR share. The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the exercise price of the granted share options. The estimated fair value of the services received is measured based on a binomial lattice model. The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model.

(*) The number of options granted and the exercise prices for option plans have been adjusted due to the dilutive effect of the capital increase (adjustment ratio of 0.794) of November 2009, extraordinary dividend distributions (adjustment ratio of 0.929) of May 2012 and extraordinary dividend distributions (adjustment ratio of 0.9364) of September 2013. The number of options granted and the exercise price mentioned above reflect the adjusted amounts.

(**) The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

(***) The board of directors of 23th March 2009 decided to extend the exercise period for option plans 1 - 4 by 5 years, in virtue of the decision by the Belgian Government to extend the Act of 26 March 1999 regarding stock options. At modification date additional fair value calculations were made based on the remaining and extended life time of the options.

Plan 1,2, 5,6 and 7 have been removed from above table as the plans matured. Plan 5 matured at the end of 2016, plans 1 and 6 matured at the end of 2017, plans 2 and 7 matured at the end of 2018. In respect of plan 2, zero options have been exercised during 2018 and 309,089 options have forfeited as a consequence of the maturity of the plan. In respect of plan 7, 211,984 options have been exercised during 2018 and 4,021 options have forfeited as a consequence of the maturity of the plan.

LIABILITY FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN AND SIMILAR LIABILITIES The group provides pension benefits for most of its employees, either directly or through a contribution to an independent fund. The pension benefits for management staff employed before 1 January 2008 are provided under a defined benefit plan. This plan is a defined benefit plan organized as a final pay program.

For the management staff employed as from 1 January 2008, the management staff promoted to management as from 1 January 2008 and the management staff who reached the age of 60, the pension benefits are provided under a defined contribution plan. Belgian defined contribution plans are subject to the Law of April 28, 2003 on supplementary pensions (WAP). According to article 24 of this law, the employer has to guarantee a fixed minimum return of 3.25% on employer contributions and of 3.75% on employee contributions and this for contributions paid until 31/12/2015. As from January 2016, the employer has to guarantee an average minimum return of 1.75% on both employer and employee contributions (as changed by the Law of 18 December 2015). This guaranteed minimum return generally exceeds the return that is normally guaranteed by the insurer. Because the employer has to guarantee the statutory minimum return on these plans, not all actuarial and investment risks relating to these plans are transferred to the insurance company managing the plans. Therefore these plans do not meet the definition of defined contribution plan under IFRS and have to be classified by default as defined benefit plans. An actuarial calculation has been performed in accordance with IAS 19 based on the projected unit credit method. This calculation resulted in a defined benefit obligation of 94 KUSD which has been registered in the consolidated accounts through the statement of Other Comprehensive Income (see table below for composition of the net obligation). The contributions recognised in the profit or loss statement in respect of this defined contribution plan amount to USD 0.6 million (2017: USD 0.7 million).

29. FINANCIAL RISKS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (IN THOUSANDS OF USD)

During the normal course of its business, EXMAR is exposed to various risks as described in more detail in the Corporate Governance Statement. EXMAR is exposed to credit, interest, currency and liquidity risks and in order to hedge this exposure, EXMAR uses various financial instruments, mainly interest rate hedges. EXMAR applies hedge accounting for all hedging relations which meet the conditions to apply hedge accounting (formal documentation and high effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis). Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting, is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value and changes in fair value of financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

CREDIT RISK POLICY Credit risk is monitored closely on an ongoing basis by the Group and creditworthiness controls are carried out if deemed necessary. At year-end no significant creditworthiness problems were noted. The borrowings to equity accounted investees consist of shareholder loans to our joint ventures that own or operate an LPG vessel or Offshore platform. As all vessels are operational and generate income, we do not anticipate any recoverability issues for the outstanding borrowings to equity accounted investees. The equity accounted investees for whom the share in the net assets is negative, are allocated to other components of the investor's interest in the equity accounted investee and if the negative net asset exceeds the investor's interest, a corresponding liability is recognized. The term of the shareholder loans are discussed in note 16 of this annual report.

The carrying amounts of the financial assets represent the maximum credit exposure.
IMPAIRMENT LOSSES As past due outstanding receivable balances are immaterial, no ageing analysis is disclosed. No important impairment losses have occurred and at reporting date, no significant allowances for impairment have been recorded.
INTEREST RISK
INTEREST RISK POLICY The interest-bearing loans are mainly negotiated with variable interest rates. In order to monitor this interest risk, the Group makes use of interest hedging instruments available on the market when management is of the opinion that it is favorable to do so. For the moment, no interest rate swaps exist within our subsidiaries. On the other hand, different interest rate swaps exist within our equity accounted investees. The Group applies hedge accounting when the conditions to apply hedge accounting are met. In case no hedge accounting is applied, the changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of profit or loss.

A significant portion of EXMAR's interest income is derived from borrowings to equity accounted investees with variable interest rates. Any increase/ decrease in the interest rate would result in an increase/decrease of interest income but would mainly be offset by an increase/ decrease in the interest expense recognized by the equity accounted investee for a corresponding amount. Accordingly, any increase/decrease in the variable interest rate applied on the borrowings to equity accounted investees would have no impact on the net result of the Group. Therefore, borrowings to equity accounted investees have not been included in the above sensitivity analysis.

CURRENCY RISK

The Group's currency risk is historically mainly affected by the EUR/USD ratio for manning its fleet, paying salaries and all other personnel-related expenses. In order to monitor the EUR currency risk, the Group uses a varied range of foreign currency rate hedging instruments if deemed necessary. As per 31 December 2018 and 2017, no forward exchange contracts were outstanding to cover the EUR/USD exposure. In 2014 and 2015, a NOK 1 billion senior unsecured bond was issued. The NOK/USD exposure was covered by two cross currency interest rate swaps that matched the debt profile of the bond. These CCIRS-contracts have ended in July 2017. As per 31 December 2017, a forward exchange contract was outstanding to cover the NOK/USD exposure. As per 31 December 2018, no forward exchange contract was outstanding in this respect.

Sensitivity analysis As per 31 December 2018 an increase in the year-end EUR/USD rate of 10% would affect the statement of profit or loss with USD -0.8 million (2017: USD 0.3 million), excluding the effect on any forward exchange contracts. A 10% decrease of the EUR/USD rate would impact the profit or loss statement with the same amount (opposite sign). The NOK/USD exposure on the outstanding NOK bond is no longer covered by the CCIRS-contracts or forward contracts. An increase in the year-end NOK/ USD rate of 10% would affect the statement of profit or loss with USD -10.5 million (2017: USD -11.1 million), excluding the effect on any forward exchange contracts. A 10% decrease of the NOK/USD rate would impact the profit or loss statement with the same amount (opposite sign).

LIQUIDITY RISK

LIQUIDITY RISK POLICY The Group manages the liquidity risk in order to meet financial obligations as they fall due. The risk is managed through a continuous cash flow projection follow-up, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratio's against internal and regulatory requirements and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources with adequate back-up facilities. Different debt covenants exist that require compliance with certain financial ratio's. As of December 31, 2018 EXMAR was compliant with all covenants. We also refer in this respect to note 24 regarding borrowings, to note 31 regarding capital commitments and to section "Significant judgments and estimates".

(*) The financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are analysed and a hierarchy in valuation method has been defined: level 1 being quoted bid prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, level 2 being inputs in other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the related assets and liabilities, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices), level 3 being inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The breakdown between level 1 and 2 of the equity instruments at FVTPL is shown in the beginning of this note. In respect of the interest-bearing loans, the fair value of the bond is based on a level 1 valuation. The carrying amount of the bond amounts to USD 123.3 million, whereas the fair value amounts to USD 116.3 million. The other interest-bearing loans are based on a level 2 valuation.

BASIS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES:

Equity instruments at FVTPL: Derivative financial instruments: Interest-bearing loans: Borrowings to equity accounted investees:

quoted closing bid price at reporting date for Teekay shares and Frontera shares/ non-quoted closing fixing price at reporting date through a public auction via Euronext for Sibelco shares
present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date quoted closing bid price at reporting date for NOK bond/ present value of future cash flows, discounted
at the market rate of interest at reporting date present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date

For certain financial assets and liabilities (trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables) not carried at fair value, no fair value is disclosed because the carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair values.

30. LEASES (IN THOUSANDS OF USD) OPERATING LEASES

LEASE OBLIGATIONS EXMAR leases a number of assets using operating lease agreements. The agreements don't impose restrictions such as additional debt and further leasing. The expense for 2018 relating to the operating lease agreements amounts to USD 10.9 million (2017: USD 11 million) of which USD 8.7 million is born by our equity accounted investees (2017: USD 8.9 million). No payments for non-cancellable subleases were received. The future minimum lease payments for our subsidiaries and equity accounted investees are as follows:

The amounts disclosed for the equity accounted investees represent our share in the lease obligations. The average duration of the lease agreements amount to 2.77 years. The group has for some of the leased assets purchase options, some contracts foresee extension options. Such options have not been taken into account for determining above lease obligations.

FINANCIAL REPORT

LEASE RIGHTS The Group entered into long-term time charter agreements for certain assets in its fleet. In respect of lease classification, it was judged that substantially all risks and rewards remain with the Group. As a consequence, these agreements qualify as operating leases. The income in 2018 relating to operating leases amounts to USD 120.2 million (2017: USD 157.6 million) of which USD 86.6 million is earned by our equity accounted investees (2017: USD 134 million). The future minimum rental receipts are as follows:

The amounts disclosed for the equity accounted investees represent our share in the lease rights. The average duration of the lease agreements amounts to 2.3 years. The Group has granted for some of these vessels purchase options and some contracts foresee a possible extension at the end of the lease agreement. Such options have not been taken into account for determining above lease rights.

The increase in operating lease rights for subsidiaries in comparison with 2017 can be explained by the employment contracts for the FSRU and the TANGO FLNG.
FINANCE LEASES

EXMAR leases 5 vessels under financial lease agreements. These vessels are all situated within our equity accounted investees. Hence, the financial lease obligations are not shown in our consolidated financial statements. The payments made in 2018 relating to the finance lease agreements amount to USD 11.5 million (2017: USD 5.1 million), all born by our equity accounted investees.
31. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS (IN THOUSANDS OF USD)

On 2nd March 2018 EXMAR announced it had contracted 2 VLGC Newbuildings with LPG as a fuel for the main engine at Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction at Subic Bay (Philippines) to serve long-term commitments with Equinor ASA of Norway for worldwide LPG transportation.

On 8th January 2019 Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction at Subic Bay (Philippines) filed for rehabilitation due to financial difficulties. The construction disruptions caused thereby obliged EXMAR to cancel both Shipbuilding Contracts and invoke the Refund Guarantee from Korean Development Bank (South Korea) to recover each of the Instalments already paid.

In order to fulfil its long-term commitments towards Equinor ASA of Norway and further dedicate its resources to innovative shipping solutions, EXMAR is currently in advanced negotiations with other shipyards to secure replacement vessels.

Several of the Group's companies are involved in a number of minor legal disputes arising from their daily management. The directors do not expect the outcome of these procedures to have any material effect on the Group's financial position.
The LNGC EXCEL owned by one of our joint ventures was party to a lease arrangement in the UK whereby the Lessor could claim depreciation on the capital expenditures it incurred to acquire the vessel (capital allowances).As is typical in these leasing arrangements, tax and change of law risks are assumed by the Lessee. Our joint venture terminated this lease arrangement in August 2013. The UK tax authorities (HMRC) have made inquiries in respect of the right to receive the Capital Allowances. Based on commercial, legal and financial considerations our position is that the allowances were validly claimed and we have informed HMRC accordingly. However in case of a successful challenge by the UK tax authorities of the tax treatment of the lease, we could be required to compensate the Lessor for any tax amount to be reimbursed to the tax authorities. At this point in time, the Board of Directors is not able to calculate the outcome and possible outflow as a consequence of this matter and is of the opinion that no provisions should be taken in the consolidated financial statements.

37. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On 2nd March 2018 EXMAR announced it had contracted 2 VLGC Newbuildings with LPG as a fuel for the main engine at Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction at Subic Bay (Philippines) to serve long-term commitments with Equinor ASA of Norway for worldwide LPG transportation.
On 8th January 2019 Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction at Subic Bay (Philippines) filed for rehabilitation due to financial difficulties. The construction disruptions caused thereby obliged EXMAR to cancel both Shipbuilding Contracts and invoke the Refund Guarantee from Korean Development Bank (South Korea) to recover each of the Instalments already paid.
In order to fulfil its long-term commitments towards Equinor ASA of Norway and further dedicate its resources to innovative shipping solutions, EXMAR is currently in advanced negotiations with other shipyards to secure replacement vessels.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The significant judgments and estimates that might have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year relates to:
GOING CONCERN The Company is of the opinion that, taking into account its available cash and cash equivalents, its undrawn committed facilities available on the date of establishing the consolidated financial statements, its projected cash flows based on approved budgets and the liquidity impact of the management measures listed below, it has sufficient liquidity to meet its present obligations and cover its working capital needs for a period of at least 12 months from the authorization date of this annual report. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 have been prepared on a going concern basis. In making this assessment, the Board of Directors assumed that the following management measures be timely and successfully completed to provide sufficient liquidity for the Company:
* The Company reached an agreement in principle with Bank of China, financing TANGO FLNG under a Loan Facility, to partially release cash currently trapped in a Debt Service Reserve Account to secure the Loan Facility. Following the execution of this agreement in principle, approximately USD 40 million restricted cash is expected to become available in May 2019 (ie after the collection of the first hire payment from YPF is expected) and an additional USD 13 million of restricted cash is expected to become available after one year of operations of TANGO FLNG. The documentation is being prepared and will be executed once the final approval of the China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation, Sinosure has been obtained.
* The Company agreed on a non-binding Term Sheet for the financing of the FSRU barge (chartered out to Gunvor) with China State Shipbuilding Corporation ("CSSC"). The FSRU barge is currently not pledged to any financings. The Company and CSSC Leasing have agreed to work towards a long term (10 years) sale and lease-back structure with drawdown of a first tranche of approximately USD 80 million net assumed in May 2019. A second tranche of approximately USD 40 million net is assumed to become available for drawdown in October 2019 (i.e. once the FSRU barge is expected to be operationally accepted by Gunvor). The total of this financing is still conditional, amongst others to final credit committee approval of CSSC but the Company is confident that such approval will be obtained in a reasonable timeframe. Gunvor has continued to pay full hire under the Time Charter Party.
* The Company is looking to refinance, partly or fully, its existing bond (approximately USD 121.4m) which is falling due on July 7, 2019. The Company believes that there is appetite for such refinancing, however no commitments have been made. DNB Markets, Nordea and Pareto Securities have been mandated in relation to a bond issue which may follow.
* In light of its ongoing operational challenges and the resulting pressure on its financial position, the Company is closely monitoring its compliance with the financial covenants. The Company has met all its financial covenants as at December 31th 2018 and the next testing date with respect to the financial position as at the end of June 2019 is in September 2019. Meeting the financial covenants at June 2019 is depending upon the successful implementation of some of the measures mentioned above. In the event of a breach of covenants the Company will request and is assuming it will be able to obtain a waiver from the relevant lenders.
The Board is confident that management will be able to timely and successfully implement these plans and therefore it has an appropriate basis for the use of the going concern assumption. In the event the above assumptions are not timely met, there is a material uncertainty whether the Company will have sufficient liquidities to fulfil its obligations for the period of at least 12 months from the date of authorising these financial statements.

FINANCIAL REPORT

STATEMENT ON THE TRUE AND FAIR VIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE FAIR OVERVIEW OF THE MANAGEMENT REPORT
The Board of Directors, represented by Nicolas Saverys and Jalcos NV represented by Ludwig Criel , and the Executive Committee, represented by Patrick De Brabandere and Miguel de Potter, hereby certifies on behalf and for the account of the company, that to their knowledge. - The consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the equity, financial position and financial performance of the company, and the entities included in the consolidation as a whole. - The annual report on the consolidated financial statements includes a fair overview of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company, and the entities included in the consolidation, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties which they are exposed to.

REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR

STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING OF EXMAR NV FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In the context of the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements of EXMAR NV ("the company") and its subsidiaries (jointly "the group"), we hereby submit our statutory audit report. This report includes our report on the consolidated financial statements and the other legal and regulatory requirements. These parts should be considered as integral to the report. We were appointed in our capacity as statutory auditor by the shareholders' meeting of 16 May 2017, in accordance with the proposal of the board of directors issued upon recommendation of the audit committee. Our mandate will expire on the date of the shareholders' meeting deliberating on the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019. We have performed the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements of EXMAR NV for 2 consecutive periods.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unqualified opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the group, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018, the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, as well as the summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. The consolidated statement of financial position shows total assets of 904 341 (000) USD and the consolidated statement of profit or loss shows a consolidated net loss for the year then ended of 16 070 (000) USD.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's net equity and financial position as of 31 December 2018 and of its consolidated results and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium.

Basis for the unqualified opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA), as applicable in Belgium. In addition, we have applied the International Standards on Auditing approved by the IAASB applicable to the current financial year, but not yet approved at national level. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Responsibilities of the statutory auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements" section of our report. We have complied with all ethical requirements relevant to the statutory audit of consolidated financial statements in Belgium, including those regarding independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and the company's officials the explanations and information necessary for performing our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Material uncertainty relating to going concern We draw attention to Note Significant judgements and estimates in the financial statements, which states that the Company is facing ongoing operational challenges that put pressure on its financial position. In preparing the financial statements, the board assumed that all management measures would be successfully and timely completed to provide sufficient liquidity to the Company during a period of at least 12 months from the authorization date of the annual report. These measures indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS

HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTERS

121

FINANCIAL REPORT

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ­ VESSELS

· Property, plant and equipment ­ vessels with a carrying amount of 564 423 (000) USD represent 62% of the consolidated balance sheet total as at 31 December 2018. Management's assessment of the valuation of property, plant and equipment was significant to our audit because this process is complex and requires significant management judgement. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of impairment, as certain significant long-lived assets currently do not yield positive operating cash flows.
Reference to disclosures We refer to the consolidated financial statements, including notes to the consolidated financial statements: 11 ­ vessels.

· We considered the process and the internal controls implemented by management and we carried out testing relating to the design and implementation of management's controls to assess impairment indicators and perform impairment testing.
· We validated for each cash generating unit if impairment indicators, as determined by IAS 36, were considered in the impairment assessment of management.
· We obtained the appraisal reports from external brokers which are used by management to test for impairment indicators and for determining the fair value less costs to sell ("FVLCTS") of the vessels. We obtained a written confirmation from the appraisers on their independence, expertise and valuation basis.
· We tested management's assumptions used in the value in use ("VIU") calculations especially the most critical assumptions such as the post contract charter rates and discount rates. In challenging these assumptions we took into account actual results, negotiated contract terms, external data, independent market reports and market conditions.
· We involved Deloitte's shipping industry fair value experts to assist us in the evaluation of the discount rates, spot hire rates/post charter rates, commission costs and scrap value of the vessel. We performed sensitivity analysis where considered necessary and assessed the consistency of valuation methodologies applied and assumptions used.
· Furthermore, we evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures regarding the impairments of property, plant and equipment.

Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium and for such internal control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters to be considered for going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no other realistic alternative but to do so.
Responsibilities of the statutory auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a statutory auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
During the performance of our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework as applicable to the audit of consolidated financial statements in Belgium.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from an error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal control;
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors;
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our statutory auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern;
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
122

FINANCIAL REPORT
· obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, amongst other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and we communicate with them about all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated to the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our report unless law or regulation precludes any public disclosure about the matter.
OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Responsibilities of the board of directors The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements.
Responsibilities of the statutory auditor As part of our mandate and in accordance with the Belgian standard complementary (revised in 2018) to the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as applicable in Belgium, our responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the director's report on the consolidated financial statements, as well as to report on these matters.
Aspects regarding the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements In our opinion, after performing the specific procedures on the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements, this report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements for that same year and has been established in accordance with the requirements of article 119 of the Companies Code.
In the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements we are also responsible to consider, in particular based on information that we became aware of during the audit, if the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements is free of material misstatement, either by information that is incorrectly stated or otherwise misleading. In the context of the procedures performed, we are not aware of such material misstatement.
The non-financial information as required by article 119, § 2 of the Companies Code, has been disclosed in the directors' report on the consolidated financial statements. This non-financial information has been established by the company in accordance with the internationally recognised framework. In accordance with article 144, § 1, 6° of the Companies Code we do not express any opinion on the question whether this non-financial information has been established in accordance with this internationally recognised framework.
Statements regarding independence · Our audit firm and our network have not performed any prohibited services and our audit firm has remained independent from the group during the
performance of our mandate. · The fees for the additional non-audit services compatible with the statutory audit, as defined in article 134 of the Companies Code, have been properly
disclosed and disaggregated in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Other statements · This report is consistent with our additional report to the audit committee referred to in article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.
