II. Significant events during 2017 External Environment
· World growth strengthened in 2017 to 3.8%, with a notable rebound in global trade, driven by an investment recovery in advanced economies, continued strong growth in emerging Asia, a notable upswing in emerging Europe, and signs of recovery in several commodity exporters.
· Among emerging market and developing economies, the rebound in export growth was particularly strong in emerging Asia, especially China.
· China's economy came back with renewed vigor and reached undoubtedly the government's GDP growth target for 2017, largely thanks to continued credit expansion and public investment and boosting confidence because of stronger domestic demand and particularly of consumption.
· Personal consumption is likely to remain strong overall, supported by growth in incomes. At the same time growth in online retail and service consumption is likely to continue.
· There is a clear intention to prioritize the quality of economic growth as private Chinese firms continued to drive a technological revolution that involves everything from e-commerce and mobile payments to artificial intelligence and driverless cars.
· The Eurozone economy was strong, against a backdrop of strong personal consumption brought by improving employment conditions, and an increase in exports in response to the recovery in the global economy.
· The UK economy is weakening somewhat. The main causes are Brexit-related uncertainty making companies cautious about investment, and the fact that rising consumer price inflation caused by a weak pound has slowed personal consumption.
· The Romanian economy grew strongly as unemployment had fallen to a record low, and the financial sector is improving. Economic growth surged to 7% in 2017--the highest in the EU. The strong growth has been fueled by domestic consumption, on the back of a multi-year fiscal expansion and minimum wage hikes.
· Regarding Greece, after almost ten years of recession and eight years in successive bailout and adjustment programs of unprecedented size, the Greek economy moved into recovery although challenges remain.
· The strong, above expectations, growth in the external environment and especially in Europe works beneficially, pulling the economy up through stronger inflows of tourism, increased demand for exports of goods, lower cost of capital and positive international energy cost conditions.
· With the elimination of the twin deficits, there is now a fiscal and macroeconomic balance, while the initiated structural reforms are gradually having a positive impact on growth.
· The current year will be, overall, a very important year as favorable prospects for tourism activity, reflected by a double-digit increase in early bookings for 2018, along with favorable growth trends in the euro area, are expected to offset the drag on growth from the additional fiscal effort and higher import spending that typically accompanies the recovery process.

III. Significant Events after the ending period and until the preparation date of the Report There are no subsequent events from the end of the period and until the preparation date of this report which influence significantly the financial statements of the Group.
Main risks and uncertainties for 2017 The main risks of the current financial year according to the Administration are the following:
IV. Risks associated with the macroeconomic environment
· The uncertainty stemming from the Greek financial crisis is likely to impose adverse effects to the business, the operating results and the financial position of the Group.
· Changes in consumers' behaviour. · The Group is susceptible to economic and political risks, as well as uncertainties pertaining to countries
where it operates. · Market Risk
- Interest Rate Risk - Foreign Exchange Risk - Prices - Inflation · Credit Risk · Liquidity Risk · Inventory Risk
Market Risk
i) Interest Rate Risk:
This risk stems from bond loans and short-term bank loans of the Group and of the leasing contracts with relating to buildings and equipment of the Group, namely the fact that these agreements are denominated at a floating rate linked to EURIBOR. Therefore, the Group is exposed to an interest rate fluctuation risk. As part of addressing this risk, the Group uses interest rate risk hedging tools.
ii) Foreign Exchange Risk:
a) Risk of reduced gross profitability due to appreciation of foreign currencies: The risk derives from the fact that the company (and the group) purchases the greatest part of its products in prices expressed in USD and sells these products to the markets in which it is active in prices expressed in local currencies. The Group's products' sales prices are finalized several months before their receipt and repayment and any possible dollar revaluation, in relation to local currencies, would increase the cost of sales, without allowing the increase of sale prices, thus depriving the Group from a part of its gross profit. Also, part of the Group's disposal expenses, and mostly royalties, is expressed in US dollars. Thus, any possible US dollar revaluation in relation to the Euro would increase the Group's operating expenses. The management of this risk is performed by the Group's cash management department, in collaboration with the pertinent commercial management, and the strategy and general planning are provided by the company's Board of Directors. Commercial managements take into consideration the foreign exchange rate change risk during the determination of their products' retail sale prices. The Group also uses foreign exchange risk setoff products, mostly forward type agreements. b) Risk from the conversion of financial statements expressed in foreign currency: The Group has investments in foreign companies, which operate in currencies other than Euro and thus their financial statements are not prepared in Euro. The Group is exposed to a risk from the conversion of the said financial statements to Euro, to be consolidated in the Group's financial statements.

iii) Price risk ­ Inflation: According to administration, the Group runs no risk from price fluctuation, since it does not own a significant securities portfolio and the prices of the products it sells do not present particular fluctuations. Thus, the international increase of inflation pressure in combination with the disturbance of the international financial system may modify consuming habits, affecting the group's sales and profitability.
Credit Risk This is the risk caused by the potential breaching of contractual obligations on behalf of the trading parties. With regard to the confrontation of the credit risk from wholesale, the Group channels the sales through the most renowned department stores in the countries in which it maintains its activities, as well as via a trustworthy network of selected franchisees. In addition, the Group deals with this kind of risks by getting involved in credit insurance contracts.
Liquidity risk Despite the unprecedented financial crisis and the liquidity downside on a global basis, the Group retains high liquidity due to its adopted capital structure as well as the retail nature of the greatest proportion of its sales. What is more, the Group acts with a view to the reinforcement of this liquidity, through the successful opening of discount outlets, aiming to the disposal of the older stock and the limitation of expenses.
Inventory risk This risk is a result of the intense retaining of older stock from certain companies of the Group and concerns its inability to dispose this stock or to distribute it in prices lower than those eventuated during its appraisal process. This risk is alleviated via specialized disposal areas-markets such as: Outlet type discount department stores, discount outlets and large hotel units, located in countries that the Group is commercially active. The Group has evaluated its older stock at its net realizable value. The estimation of these values is based on the management's experience and the actual market data. Furthermore, management believes that this evaluation method (essentially forecasting for stock evaluation) covers the inventory risk entirely.
External Factors that may affect the financial results and the share price The supply and demand for products, as well as the cost, sales and results of the Issuer and the Group overall, are affected by various external factors, such as political instability, financial uncertainty and the market recession. These risks affect each company in a different degree, regardless of the sectors they are doing business in.
V. Labour and environmental issues On December 31, 2017 the Group employed 5,079 employees, over 4,996 employees on December 31, 2016. The corresponding figures for the Company are 1,142 versus 1,099. The Group employs (a) employees with permanent contracts, (b) wage workers, and (c) hourly employees. Additionally, a Labour union was formed in consolidated companies Attica Department Stores S.A. (About 180 members). The Group fully respects the environmental legislation of the countries it operates. More precisely, it participates in recycling programs and ensures the accurate application of the relevant laws in terms of (a) packaging, (b) electrical accumulators and other vehicles equipment, as well as (c) electrical and electronic equipment. It has also signed contracts with certified companies responsible for managing recycled material. The Group's cooperation with suppliers is based on standards prohibiting any form of child labour, discrimination or inflicted labour, securing the health and safety of the employees involved in the production process, as well as equality of payments and respect of the life quality. We visit our suppliers regularly in order to ensure that every single one of them complies with the principles of social responsibility inspired by us.

VII. Corporate Social Responsibility
"We Care"
The FF Group's Corporate Responsibility scheme is based upon a wider strategic approach and is definedby the philosophy of each and every distinct company. Every corporate responsibility act is defined by themanagement's commitments towards the employees, the shareholders, the clients, the suppliers, and thesociety at large. In a wider sense, these stakeholders constitute the family, in which the FF Group grows,operating with responsibility and respect. The Group's Corporate Responsibility scheme applies globally, in all markets that the company enters, confirming its respect to all the relevant communities and corresponding to each region's needs. Taking always into account the diversity and particularity of each one of the 30 countries of its operation, the Group develops and implements a holistic and focused Corporate Social Responsibility Programme, according to the basic axes that the Headquarters in Athens define. With the basic axes evolving around Culture and Sports, Society and Environment, the FF Group's Corporate Responsibility Programme spreads through both a national and international level.
Culture/Sports Axis
Being a Group that operates in many different countries, the FF Group embraces culture and arts as global means of communication that unite civilizations. Thus, culture has been a major feature of the social contribution of the FF Group: the cooperation with organizations which promote culture and arts is considered as of really high importance in order to preserve each region's cultural heritage and also to support the artists' efforts. The FF Group is a member and support actively Benaki Museum in Athens. In the past, the FF Group has sponsored several cultural events in Greece and abroad, events such as the first Kabuki Theater in Megaron-the Athens Concert Hall, Stefanos Korkolis' concert in Herodeion and Dionysis Savopoulos' concert in Benaki Museum in Athens. Our philosophy regarding arts and culture is transferred globally: in October 2005, Folli Follie was honoured to support the Hong Kong closing concert of the Greek performer Nana Moushouri, who is a UNESCO Good Will Ambassador. Moreover, in May 2007, during Mrs Dora Bakoyannis', Minister of External Affairs visit in China, Folli Follie sponsored the renowned Greek singer, Alkistis Protopsalti's concert, in the Forbidden City of Beijing. Folli Follie also sponsored the "Sensitivity Questioned" exhibition that was hosted at Ileana Tounta Gallery, in Athens in 2010. The exhibition was dedicated to femininity through the eyes of a male, with the participation of famous Greek and international artists. In March 2013, the FF Group sponsored the 7th Panorama of Contemporary Greek Cinema, organized in Paris by the Greek Cultural Centre. In 2014 and 2015, the Group sponsored the performances of Theatroparea `08, which is a non-profit organization and part of the proceeds were donated to charities. Along the Sports axis, Folli Follie honoured the Vouliagmeni female polo team ­ European Champion 2010 ­ by dedicating and naming a sports watch collection "Water Champ". Folli Follie, as a company which always promotes its Hellenic heritage and roots wanted to express its gratitude to the "golden girls" of the female polo team. The "Water Champ" collection is one of the company's most symbolic watch collections and enjoys a great success. In August 2012, Folli Follie sponsored the sailing race "Aegean Regatta 2012". The race took place in Greece for the 11th consecutive year, starting from the island of Mytilene in the North Aegean Sea and reaching its final destination, the island of Syros in the Cyclades. Folli Follie shares with the "Aegean Regatta" Tournament the same respect and admiration towards Greece and also the strong will to promote the country's beauty abroad. For this reason, Folli Follie offered to the participants a 2 days free docking in the Tourist Port ("Marina") of Mytilene, the port from where the yachting boats started their race and awarded the winners with the Folli Follie "Regatta" collection watches. In 2012, the FF Group through Converse and in collaboration with the municipality of Piraeus, took over the repair of an abandoned basketball court, in a neglected neighborhood, rejuvenated it by painting it with vivid colors and

offered it back to the local community. This activation provided the neighborhood's young inhabitants with a new and pleasant place of entertainment and sports. In 2012 and 2013, Folli Follie honouring its Greek Heritage and aiming to stand by any initiative that promotes the modern face of Greece, sponsored the "Spetses Classic Yacht Race", which featured some of the most renowned classic yachts in Greece using as a backdrop the beautiful island of Spetses in Greece. Additionally, Folli Follie in 2013 was a proud supporter of Spetses Mini Marathon in Spetses, Greece, showcasing how sportsmanship and athletic lifestyle can be ideally combined with striking style. Another Corporate Responsibility initiative of the FF Group, and one that the company takes great pride in, is the Folli Follie sponsoring the Greek Delegation of the X Special Olympics World Winter Games in Peyong Chang, Korea in 2013. Links of London, the Creators of the Official Jewellery Collection of London 2012 Olympic Games, proudly supported the first ladies running competition which took place in Greece, the "Ladies Run" for three consecutive years (2012-2014). Hundreds of women, who are passionate for running, were gathered in Laimos, Vouliagmeni, participated in the race and each one of them was awarded with the exclusively designed and limited edition Ladies Run bracelet. In 2017 FF Group sponsored the Legends 2004 vs Inter Forever charity football match, under its brands Folli Follie and Factory Outlet. The match took place on Wednesday, June 7, 2017, at the Pancretan Stadium of Heraklion, Crete. The European Champions of 2004 welcomed Inter Milan's superstars in a football night filled with memories and pride, in order to support the charity work of "Orama Elpidas". Folli Follie was the major sponsor of the National Men's and Women's Beach Volley Championship that took place in Spetses from the 16th to the 18th of June 2017. Indicatively, the brand undertook the construction of the court, as well as the cost of the medals for the winners and participants. Since 2017, FF Group, along with GEPAWORLD, is the official apparel sponsor of Greece national basketball team. The new outfits for the National Men's and Women's Basketball Teams were officially revealed, here, at the headquarters of FF Group, on June 19th, 2017, in the presence of National Team players Giannis Bourousis, Kostas Papanikolaou, Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounmpo.
Society Axis

The activities of the FF Group extend to long-lasting charity initiatives throughout Greece and globally, covering the needs of schools, non-profit institutions and NGOs that involve children, the tenderest part of society as well as women. In addition, the FF Group continues to demonstrate its sensitivity to social solidarity issues that are not direct business actions but topics, which the company feels a great responsibility to bring to the public's attention. As for the rest of the world, the FF Group sponsors various charitable causes dedicated to public welfare, such as the Cancer Fund in Hong Kong, where it has been the major sponsor of the "Pink Revolution" campaign for a series of years. In autumn 2009, Folli Follie designed and distributed internationally two limited edition bracelets in collaboration with the leading non-profit organisation "Save the Children", and part of their proceeds was donated to support its remarkable activities. During 2011 Folli Follie also supported the non-profit organization "The Art of Elysium" through the opening of the new Folli Follie boutiques in New York (Soho & Lord & Taylor). This organization was established in 1997 and its objective is to encourage working actors, artists and musicians to voluntarily dedicate their time and talent to children who are battling serious medical conditions.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), as incorporated under Greek Law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements section of our report. We remained independent of the Company and its subsidiaries throughout the period of our appointment in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), as incorporated under Greek Law, together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements in Greece, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters and the related risks of material misstatement, were addressed in the context of our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Other information
The management is responsible for the other information. The Other Information is included in the Board of Directors Report, being referred to in the ''Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements'' and in the Statements of the Members of the Board of Directors but does not include the financial statements and the audit report thereon.
Our opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any kind of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard
Responsibilities of the management and those charged with governance for the separate and consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the separate and consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company and Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee (art. 44 L. 4449/2017) of the Company is responsible for overseeing the Company's and the Group's financial reporting process.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate and consolidated financial statements as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in the Greek Law, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 01.01-31.12.2017

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate and consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in the Greek Law, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control. · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company's and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the separate and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. · Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the separate and consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company and group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. · We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

The subsidiary company FF Australia LTD was established in the second semester of 2017 and it is a structured entity consolidated via the Full Consolidation Method.
2 Important accounting policies of the Group
2.1 Framework for the preparation of the Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements of the Company (hereafter "Financial Statements") have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter referred to as IFRS) which have been adopted by the European Union.
2.2 New standards and interpretation
(a) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations adopted by the Company.
The accounting policies and calculations on the basis of which the financial statements were prepared are consistent with those policies and calculations that were used in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year 2016, except for the following amendments, which were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2017. The following amendments did not have a material impact on the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017:
· IAS 12 (Amendments) -- «Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses». The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the accounting treatment of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses on debt securities at fair value. For example, the amendments clarify the accounting treatment of deferred tax assets when an entity is not permitted to deduct the unrealized losses for tax purposes or when it has the intent and the ability to hold debt securities until the reversal of the unrealized losses.
· IAS 7 (Amendments) «Disclosure Initiative». The purpose of these amendments is to allow the users of the financial statements to evaluate the changes in liabilities that arising from financing activities. The amendments will require that the entities provide disclosures that allow investors to measure changes in liabilities arising from financial activities, including changes from cash flows and noncash changes.
· The IASB issued a new round of annual IFRS upgrades (2014-2016), which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The improvement did not have a significant impact on the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
· IFRS 12 «Disclosure of participations in other entities». The amendments clarify that the disclosure notifications of IFRS 12, except for disclosures about the summary of financial information about subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, they are applied for the involvement of an entity in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate classified as held for sale, as held for distribution or discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5.
(b) Standards that have been issued but are not applicable in the current accounting period and have not been earlier adopted
· IFRS 9 «Financial Instruments - Classification and Measurement». The Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and an earlier application is permitted. The final version of IFRS 9 brings together the "financial instruments" phases and it replaces IAS 39 "Financial Instruments" and all the previous versions of IFRS 9. The Standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting.

· The Company and the Group will apply the new standard on the required date without adjusting the comparative information. It is estimated that it will not have a significant impact.

· IFRS 15 «Revenue from Contracts with Customers». The standard is applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to be applied to revenue arising from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction or the industry. The new model is based on the principle that the revenue is recognized when the control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. The Company and the Group plan to adopt the new standard on the required date by cumulatively adjusting the retained earnings. It is estimated that it will not have a significant impact.

· IFRS 15 (Clarifications) «Revenue from Contracts with Customers». The clarifications are applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and an earlier application is permitted. The objective is to clarify the intentions of the IASB in developing the requirements of IFRS 15 "Revenue from Client Contracts", relating to: (a) the accounting treatment of performance obligations, where the wording of the principle of 'individually identifiable' (b) the estimates made in the decision on an originator or representative, including the assessment of whether a company is an originator or a representative, the application of the "control" principle and (c) licenses as well as additional clarifications on the accounting of intellectual property and rights. Clarifications provide additional practical facilities for companies that apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or choose to apply the modified retrospective approach. It is estimated that it will have no significant impact on the company and the Group.

· IFRS 16 «Leases». The standard is applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to the contract, namely the client (the lessee) and the supplier (the lessor). The new standard requires tenants to recognize most leases in their financial statements. Lessees will have a single accounting framework for all leases, with some exceptions. The bookkeeping of the lessors remains virtually unchanged. It is estimated that it will have no significant impact on the company and the Group.

· IFRS 10 (Amendment) «Consolidated Financial Statements» and IAS 28 «Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures»: Sale or transfer of assets between an investor and the associate of the company or its joint venture. The amendments address a recognized inconsistency between the requirements of IFRS 10 and those requirments of IAS 28 to address the sale or transfer of assets between the investor and the associate of the company or its venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full profit or loss is recognized when the transaction includes a business (whether hosted in a subsidiary or not). A partial profit or loss is recognized when the transaction includes assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are held in a subsidiary. In December 2015 IASB postponed indefinitely the date of application of this modification, pending the results of his work to the equity method. These amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union.

· IFRS 2 (Amendments) «Clarifications of classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions» The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and an early adoption is permitted. The amendments provide requirements for the accounting treatment (a) of the effects of vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of share-based payment and cash-settled transactions; (b) share-based payment obligations (c) the accounting treatment of changes in share-based payment terms and conditions that differentiates the classification of a transaction from settlement in cash in a transaction settled with equity instruments. The amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union.

· IAS 40 (Amendments) «Transfers of Investment Property». The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, while earlier application is permitted. The

amendments specify when an entity transfers a property, including property under construction or utilization, to or from investment property. The amendments state that a change in the use of a property takes place when the property meets or falls to be fulfilled, the definition of investment property and there is a clear indication of that change. Simply changing the management's intentions to use the property does not prove a change in its use. The amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union.
· IFRS 9 (Amendment) «Prepayment features with negative compensation». The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while earlier application is permitted. The amendment specifies that the pre-paid financial assets that allow or require a party to either pay or receive reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract (in the sense that the asset holder may incur a charge due to early repayment) may be measured at amortized cost or at fair value through the statement of other comprehensive income. The amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union.
· IAS 28 (Amendments) «Long-term Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures»: The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while an earlier application is permitted. The amendments relate to whether the measurement (and, in particular, impairment) of long-term investments in associates and joint ventures, which are in fact part of the net investment in the associate or the joint venture, are governed by IFRS 9, IAS 28 or in a combination of the two standards. The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 before applying IAS 28 to those long-term investments for which the equity method does not apply. When applying IFRS 9, an entity does not take into account any adjustments in the carrying amount of long-term participations that results from the application of IAS 28. The amendments have not yet been adopted by the European Union.
· IFRIC Interpretation 22 "Foreign currency transactions and prepayments": The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, while an earlier application is permitted. The interpretation clarifies the accounting treatment of transactions that involve the receipt or payment of an advance payment in foreign currency. This interpretation considers transactions in foreign currency where the entity recognizes non-monetary asset or non-financial obligation arising from the receipt or payment of an advance before the inception of the related asset, output or income. The Interpretation indicates that the transaction date for determining the exchange rate is the date of initial recognition of a non-cash advance or deferred revenue. If there are multiple payments or receipts, the entity must set the transaction date for each payment and advance payment. The interpretation has not yet been adopted by the European Union.
· IFRIC Interpretation 23 "Uncertainty about income taxes": The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while an earlier application is permitted. The interpretation provides guidance on the treatment of uncertainty inherent in tax manipulations in accounting for income taxes. The interpretation provides additional clarification regarding the examination of uncertain tax considerations individually or jointly, the examination of fiscal assessments by the tax authorities, the appropriate method to reflect the uncertainty of the acceptance of the visa by the tax authorities and the examination of the consequences of changes in facts and circumstances. The interpretation has not yet been adopted by the European Union.
· IAS 19: (Amendments) Modification, curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan: amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while an earlier application is permitted. The amendments require entities to provide updated actuarial assumptions used to determine the current employment cost and net interest on the balance of the annual reporting period after a change, a curtailment or a settlement of a defined benefit plan. The amendments also stipulate that the implementation of the requirements of the ceiling of the asset is affected from the accounting

· The IASB issued a new round of annual IFRS upgrades (2014-2016), which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 for IAS 28 "Interests in associates and joint ventures" for which earlier application is permitted.
· IAS 28 "Investments in associates and joint ventures": The amendments clarify that the option to measure at fair value through profit or loss, an investment in an associate or a joint venture held by an entity that is an investment fund management company or a similar entity may be carried out separately for each investment in an associate or joint venture, during initial recognition.
· The IASB issued a new round of annual IFRS upgrades (2015-2017), which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while earlier application is permitted. These upgrades have not yet been adopted by the European Union.
· IFRS 3 "Business Mergers" and IFRS 11 "Joint Arrangements": the amendments to IFRS 3 specify that when an entity acquires control of a venturer that is a joint venture, the entity re-measures the holding previously held by that entity. The amendments to IFRS 11 specify that when an entity acquires joint control of a joint venture, the entity does not remeasure the holding previously held by that entity.
· IAS 12 "Income Taxes": The amendments clarify that the tax implications of paying for financial instruments which are classified as equity should be recognized depending on where transactions or events of the past that created the distributable profits have been recognized.
· IAS 23 "Borrowing costs": the amendments clarify paragraph 14 of the standard so that when a
qualifying asset is ready for the use for which it is destined or for sale, and a part of a loan received specifically for that asset remains as an outstanding balance at that time, these borrowing costs should be included in the capital generated by general borrowing.

2.3 Consolidation

2.3.1 Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries. Controlling procedures take place as long as the parent company is able to define the financial and operational activities of an affiliate, with a view to gaining some benefit. The results, assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are integrated into the financial statements based on the method of complete consolidation. The financial statements of the subsidiaries have been prepared as per the same accounting policies followed by the company. Inter-company transactions, balances, as well as incomes and expenses are eliminated during consolidation. The accounting goodwill derived from businesses acquisition, is registered as a non-depreciable asset, subject to annual impairment audit, in case it is positive. If it is negative, it is registered as income in the financial results of the Group. The goodwill captures the difference between the acquisition price and the reasonable value of the separate assets, the liabilities and potential liabilities of the acquired company.

2.3.2 Associates
Associates are companies in which the group has the ability to exercise significant influence and are not subsidiaries or joint ventures. Significant influence is the power to participate in decisions on financial and business policies of the company, but not the control over those policies. Significant influence normally exists when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights through ownership of shares or through another type of agreement.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 01.01-31.12.2017

51

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

Investments in associates are initially recognized at cost and for consolidation purposes, the equity method is used. The goodwill included in the carrying amount (cost) of the investment and is reviewed for impairment as part of the investment. When a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, any intercompany profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of participation of the Group at the relevant associate. All subsequent changes in the rate of participation in the equity of the associate are recognized in the carrying amount of the group's investment.
Changes stemming from profits or losses of associates are recognized in the consolidated income statement and changes that have been directly recognized in equity of associates are recognized in the consolidated equity of the group. Any changes recognized directly in equity and are not associated with the result, such as the distribution of dividends or other transactions with shareholders of the associate recognized against the carrying value of the participation. No effect on the net result or equity is recognized in these transactions.
When the share of losses group in an associate equals or exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless the Group has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf the associate. The accounting policies of associates are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. In the financial statements of the parent company, investments in associated companies are valued in accordance with IAS 28, at acquisition cost less any accumulated losses from impairment.
2.3.3 Currency translations (a) Operating currency and presentation currency The figures of the financial statements regarding the Group's subsidiaries and the parent company are noted in Euro; which is the currency of the financial environment within which they operate (functional currency).

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 01.01-31.12.2017

52

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

(b) Transactions and balances Any transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency, based on the valid exchange rates on the transactions' dates. Any profits or losses stemming from currency differences that generated during the clearing of such transactions throughout the fiscal year, or upon the conversion of the currency figures expressed in a foreign currency based on the current exchange rates, applicable on the date of the Balance Sheet publication, are registered in the financial results. Any exchange rate differences derived from noncurrency elements valued at their reasonable price, are considered as a section of the reasonable value; thus they are registered in the same section with the differences of reasonable value. The figures presented in the financial statements of the Group's companies are based on the prevailing currency of the specific country where each company is active. The individual financial statements of the companies participating in the consolidation, which had initially presented in a currency other than the Group's currency for presentation purposes, have been converted into . Assets and liabilities have been translated into , based on the exchange rate on the closing date of the balance sheet. Incomes and expenses have been translated into the currency used for the Group's presentation purposes, based on the average exchange rates of each fiscal year. Any differences resulting from this procedure are transferred to the reserve fund for subsidiary balance sheets translation in a foreign currency, in the net position, through the remaining total earnings.

2.4 Tangible Assets
Tangible Assets are consistently valued at the acquisition cost less depreciation. Acquisition cost includes all expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of these assets. Subsequent expenditures increase the book value of tangible assets, only if it is believed that future economic benefits will pump into the group and their cost can be measured reliably. Establishments in third party properties (opening of shops) are depreciated based on the estimated lease duration. Depreciations are calculated using the straight-line method over their useful life, as follows:

Asset Category Buildings (privately owned) Electro-Mechanical etc. installations on privately owned buildings Installations on third parties' property Mechanical equipment Motor vehicles Other equipment

Operational Years 50
20-25 8-12 7-9 7-9
7

The self-produced tangible assets constitute an addition to the acquisition cost of the tangible assets in values that incorporate the direct payroll cost of the personnel participating in the manufacturing procedure, the cost of consumed materials and other general costs. Tangible assets' residual values and useful lives are subject to review on the date of the balance sheet. If the residual values, the expected useful life or the expected consumption rate of future financial benefits incorporated in an asset change, these changes are treated as changes in accounting estimations. In case of a tangible asset sale, the differences between the value received and its accounting value are recognised as profit or losses in the results. The accounting value of tangible assets is checked for devaluation when there are relevant indications, i.e. in circumstances showing that the accounting value may not be retrievable. If there is such an indication that the accounting value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are devaluated up to the recoverable amount. The retrievable amount of property, infrastructure and equipment is the greater between the net selling price and their usage value. To calculate the usage value, the expected future cash flows are discounted at their current value using the pre-tax discount rate that reflects market's current estimations regarding the time value of money value and the risks related to the corresponding asset. When the tangible assets' accounting values exceed their recoverable value, the difference (devaluation) is initially recognised as a decrease in the fair value reserve (it case there is one linked with the asset in question)

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 01.01-31.12.2017

53

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

which is reported in equity accounts. Every devaluation loss exceeding the reserve corresponding to a specific asset is directly recognised as expense in the income statement.
2.5 Investments in property
Investments in property are investments related to all those properties (including land, buildings or parts of buildings), purchased by the group, and used for leasing purposes. Property investments are initially registered at their acquisition cost including any transaction costs. Subsequently they are valued at fair value. Management determines the fair value using various valuation methods. The purpose of using a specific valuation method is the determination of the transaction price on the valuation date, on a commercial basis, driven by regular business considerations. The evaluation methods, include among others, the use of recent commercial-based transactions, the reference to the current fair value of a substantially similar instrument, as well as the analysis of the discounted cash flows. The estimation of the properties fair value was conducted by a registered real estate expert who has the skills and experience required for the assessment procedure and is totally irrelevant to the group. The reassessment / assessment concerns only the land and buildings and does not take into consideration the engineering or other mobile equipment of the Company. Since there is no establishment of horizontal or vertical ownerships of the buildings, the distinction of the estimated value between the land and a building was considered as the proportional land area per building, based on the above said structure. The book value reported in the Group's financial statements, reflect the market conditions on the date of balance sheet generation. Any gain or loss resulting from a change in fair value of properties investments is recognized in the income statement incurred. Transfers towards the category of real estate investments are only conducted in case of a change in their perceived use, because of the end of the private-use period on behalf of the Group, the finalization of an asset's construction, or the utilization of an operating lease derived from a third party. Accounting transfers of properties from "investments" into "owner-occupied" category are only executed in case of a change on their utilization purposes, evidenced by their establishment as owner-occupied assets or their classification as held for sale properties. For the transfer of property from the category of "investments" into the category of "owneroccupied", the reasonable cost of the property used for its subsequent accounting manipulation, is its fair value on the date of the change of use. Gains or losses resulting from the removal or disposal of the investment in property, are recognized in the income statement of the period that the removal or disposal took place. Group's real estate investments refer to two properties located at Piraeus Street and at the airport. The reasonable value of the investment properties of the Group, equal to approx. 75 mil., was estimated by an independent and chartered assessor at the beginning of 2010. The same value was also taken into account for the financial statements of the current fiscal year, given that there was no change in the conditions in relation to the valuation.
2.6 Intangible Assets
2.6.1 Trademarks and Licenses
The acquired trademarks and licenses are initially recognized at historical cost. The licenses have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the method of the useful life with a view to the allocation of trademarks and licenses costs throughout their estimated useful life.
2.6.2 Other Intangible Assets
This category incorporates the Group's rental rights, initially recognized at their acquisition cost. After the initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss that may have occurred. It also includes purchased software used in administration or production process. The acquired licenses related to software are capitalized on the basis of the incurred expenses during the acquisition and installation of the software. The costs associated with the maintenance of computer software are recognized in the period in which they occur. The capitalized costs are depreciated based on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.

2.6.3 Assets Impairments
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are not amortized, are reviewed for impairment at least annually. The assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The retrievable amount is the higher between the fair value less the costs required for the disposal and the value in use of the asset. The use value is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the appropriate discount rate. If the recoverable value is less than the undischarged, then the latter is reduced down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized as expenses in the income statement of the period they incurred, unless the asset has been readjusted so that the impairment loss decreases the corresponding revaluation reserve. When in a later period the impairment loss should be reversed, the carrying value of the asset is increased up to the level of the revised estimate of recoverable amount, provided that the new book value does not exceed the residual value as it would have been determined if the impairment losses had not been registered in previous periods. The reversal of the loss is recognized as an income, unless the asset has been readjusted. In this case, the reversal increases the corresponding revaluation reserve.
For the assessment of impairment losses, assets are included in the smallest possible cash-generating units.

2.7 Financial Assets
2.7.1 Initial Recognition
Financial assets are recorded in the Group's balance sheet, since it becomes part of the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The assets of the group are classified in the following categories:
 Loans and receivables, receivables from trading activities  Current and time deposits  Financial assets at fair value through profit  Financial assets available for sale, and  Investments held to maturity.
Financial assets are divided into different categories by management, based on their characteristics and the purpose for which they were acquired.
The category in which each financial instrument is classified, differs from the others as different rules apply with respect to their valuation and the recognition of each designated financial result either in the income statement or directly in equity. Financial assets are recognized depending on the accounting date that the trade was executed.

2.7.2 Financial Assets at fair value through results
Financial assets deriving their fair value through the income statement, include assets held primarily for commercial purposes valued by the group at fair price through income statement upon initial recognition. In addition, derivative financial assets which do not qualify for accounting hedge are classified in this category. Financial assets included in this category are valued at fair value through the results and cannot be reclassified to another category. The financial assets that have been classified in this in this category include shares listed on the Athens and Cyprus Stock Exchange and mutual fund shares.

2.7.3 Investments held until maturity
The held-to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determined payments and fixed maturity. The financial assets classified as held-to maturity investments as long as management is willing and able to hold them until maturity.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 01.01-31.12.2017

55

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

After initial recognition, investments that fall into this category are valued at residual cost, using the effective interest rate method. The residual cost is the amount in which the financial asset was initially measured or the financial liability after the deduction of principal repayments, including or excluding any accumulated depreciation of any difference between that initial amount and the amount payable at maturity, calculated with the method of effective interest rate, after the deduction of any devaluation. The calculation includes all fees and units paid or received between the parties, which are considered an integral part of the effective interest rate, the transaction costs and any discount or impairment. Moreover, if there is any evidence that a financial asset has declined in value, then the investment is valued at the present value of projected cash flows and any difference from the book value of the investment is recognized in the income statement as a loss.
Fair Value
The fair value of the investments in an active market is demonstrated by reference to quoted market prices on the balance sheet date. If the market for an investment is not active, management determines the fair value using valuation techniques. The purpose of using a valuation technique is the determination of the transaction price on the measurement date, based on an entirely commercial context, driven by regular business considerations. The evaluation methods include among others, the use of recent commercial-based transactions, the reference to the current fair value of a relevant instrument, as well as the analysis its of discounted cash flows.
2.8 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower price between the acquisition value and net realizable value. Cost is calculated based on the weighted average cost. Net realizable value is estimated based on the inventories current selling prices in the context of the ordinary course of business and after the deduction of any selling expenses where applicable.

2.9 Loans, receivables from business and other receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that have no quoted price in the active market. They come into existence when the Group provides money, products or services directly to a debtor with no intention of commercial claim.
Loans and receivables are measured at unamortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any devaluation provisions. Every change in the value of loans and receivables is recognized in the income statement when the loans and receivables are eliminated or undergo a value discount, as well as during the application of the effective interest method.
The receivables from commercial activities are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently are measured at unamortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts, are recognized in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset has been impaired. The recognized provision is measured as the difference between the book value of the asset and the present value of its expected cash flows discounted at the applicable effective interest rate upon the initial recognition. For some receivables, impairment checks are executed per individual requirement (e.g. for each customer separately) whenever the recovery of the claim has been declared overdue on the date of the financial statements or in cases where objective evidence indicates the need for an impairment. Other assets are pooled and tested for impairment in total. The amount of impairment losses is the difference between the carrying value and the estimated future cash flows of the receivables. The amount of impairment loss is recorded as an expense in the financial results.

Receivables and loans are included in current assets, except those falling due after twelve months from the balance sheet date. These are characterized as non-current assets. They are also classified as commercial and other receivables in the balance sheet and constitute a vast proportion of the Group's financial assets.

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

2.10 Cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include the cash deposited in the bank or held in hand, as well as short term highly liquid investments such as repos and deposits maturing in less than three months. For the preparation of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, excluding the outstanding balances of bank overdrafts.

2.11 Share Capital
Common shares are classified as equity. Direct costs linked with the issuance of shares, are considered after the deduction of the relative income tax. Direct costs associated with the issuing of shares towards the acquisition of other companies are included in the acquisition cost of the purchased company. The acquisition cost of treasury shares after the exclusion of income tax (if applicable), is shown as a deduction in the group's equity, until the aforementioned shares are sold or canceled. Any gain or loss from the sale of treasury shares, free of direct transaction costs and other income tax, if any, is presented as an equity reserve.

2.12 Financial Obligations
2.12.1 Initial Recognition
The financial liabilities are registered in the Group's balance sheet once the group becomes part of the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group's financial liabilities include bank loans and overdraft accounts (overdraft), trade and other payables, as well as financial leases.
Financial liabilities are classified in the following categories:  Financial liabilities available at fair value through financial results  Financial liabilities available at depreciated cost.
2.12.2 Financial Obligations (other than loans)
Financial liabilities are recognized when the group is involved in a contractual agreement of the financial instrument and are deleted when the group is exempted from the liability or this is cancelled or expired. Liabilities from financial leases are measured at initial value less the amount of financial capital repayments, while interest is recognized as an expense item in the "Financial expenses" in the Income Statement. Trade payables are recognized initially at their nominal value and subsequently are measured at the unamortized cost. Gains and losses are recognized in the Income Statement when the liabilities are eliminated, as well as when the effective interest rate method is applied. Dividends to shareholders are recognized in the account "Dividends Payable", when approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
Liabilities from trading activities are recognized initially at their fair value and subsequently are measured at the undepreciated cost using the effective interest rate method.
2.12.3 Bank Loans
All loans are initially recognized at cost, which is the fair value of the amount received, irrespective of their direct issuing expenses. After the initial recognition, loans are evaluated at their undepreciated cost, based on the method of the effective interest rate, and any difference is recorded in the financial results during the loan period.

2.13 Accounting Income Tax
2.13.1 Current Income Tax
Current tax claims / liabilities include those claims or obligations imposed by the tax authorities relating to the current or previous reporting periods that have not been paid until the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the prevailing tax rates and tax laws on the basis of the taxable profits each year. All changes on the current tax claims or liabilities are recognized as expense in the income statement.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 01.01-31.12.2017

57

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

2.13.2 Deferred Income Tax
Deferred income tax is calculated based on the liability method which focuses on the temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the book value of the claims and liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. Deferred tax claims are recognized to the extent that they are likely to be offset against future income taxes. The group recognizes a previously unrecognized deferred tax claim to the extent that a future taxable profit is likely to be generated. The deferred tax claim is reviewed on every balance sheet date and is reduced up to the extent that a sufficient taxable profit that would allow the recovery of such claim is not likely to be generated. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Tax losses can be transferred to subsequent periods are recognized as deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax claims and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates expected to apply during the settlement period of the claim or liability, taking into account the tax rates (and tax laws) substantially prevailing on the date of Balance Sheet. Changes in deferred tax claims or liabilities are recognized as part of the income tax on the income statement, except for those resulting from specific changes on assets or liabilities, which are recognized directly in the Group's equity and result in a relative change in deferred tax claims or liabilities being charged / credited to the relevant equity account.
2.14 Retirement Benefits and Short-term Employee Benefits
2.14.1 Short-term Benefits
Short-term benefits for employees (other than benefits for the termination of employment) in cash and in kind are recognized as an expense when accrued. Any unpaid amount is recorded as a liability, unless the amount already paid exceeds the amount of benefits. Then, the company recognizes this excessive amount as an asset (prepaid expense) only to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a series of lower future payments or a refund.

2.14.2 Benefits payable after leaving service
The Group has both programs of fixed contributions as well as programs of fixed provisions.
2.14.2.1 Defined Contribution
The staff group is mainly covered by the main State Insurance Agency on the private sector (IKA) provided pension and medical benefits. Each employee is required to contribute part of their monthly salary to the fund, while contributing a portion covered by the group. Upon retirement, the pension fund responsible for paying pension benefits to employees. Consequently, the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay future benefits under this program. Under the defined contribution plan, the group's obligation (legal or constructive) is limited to the amount agreed to contribute to the organization (e.g. fund) that manages contributions and provides benefits. Thus, the amount of benefits the employee will receive is determined by the amount paid by the group (or the employee) and paid by the investment of contributions thereof. A contribution payable by the group in a defined contribution plan is recognized as a liability after removal of the levy paid and a corresponding output.

2.14.2.2 Defined Benefit Liabilities ­ Retirement Benefit due to service exit
The obligation in the balance sheet for defined benefit plans is the present value of the liability for the defined benefit under the Law 2112/20 and changes resulting from any actuarial gains or losses and past service cost. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in the proportional cases at the end of the previous year exceeded 10% of defined benefit obligation, are charged or credited to the results based on the expected average remaining working lives of employees participating in this program.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 01.01-31.12.2017

58

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

Past service cost is recognized directly in profit or loss, unless the changes in pension plans are optional for the retention of workers in service for a specified period (vesting date). In this case, the service cost is amortized on a regular basis until the date of vesting of benefits. The termination benefits paid service when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary retirement from service in return for these benefits. The group recognizes these termination benefits when demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of workers according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of the bid to encourage voluntary redundancy. Where termination benefits attributable to service rendered beyond twelve months after the balance sheet date, discounted to present value.
The actuarial study was conducted by an independent actuary using the method of projected unit credit (projected unit credit method). Specifically, the study involved the investigation and calculation of actuarial sizes required by the standards set by International Accounting Standards (IAS 19) and is required to be registered in the balance sheet and income statement of each company.

2.15 Other Provisions
Provisions are recognized when a present commitment is likely to lead to a reliably-estimated outflow of economic resources for the Group. The timing or the amount of the outflow can be uncertain. A present obligation arises from the existence of a legal or constructive obligation resulting from past events. Each formed prediction is used only for the expenses that it was originally meant to cover. Provisions are reviewed on each balance sheet date and are adjusted in order to reflect the best current estimate. The provisions are valued at the expected cost required for the present commitment to be settled, based on the most trustworthy evidence available on the balance sheet date, including the risks and uncertainties related to this commitment. When the effect of time value of money is significant, the amount of the provision is the present value of the expenses expected to be required for the settlement of the obligation. When discounting method is used, the book value of a forecast increases in each period so as to reflect the passage of time. This increase is recognized as an expense in financial results. When there is a number of similar commitments, the likelihood that an outflow will be required towards a settlement, is determined by taking into account the category of commitments, as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the possibilities of an outflow included in the category of commitments are limited. If it is not likely that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required for the settlement of the commitment, the provision is reversed.

2.16 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements but are disclosed, unless the probability of resource outflows incorporating economic benefits is minimal.
2.17 Contingent assets
Possible inflows of economic benefits for the group not being able to be recognized as assets, are considered contingent assets and are disclosed in the notes of the financial statements.

2.18 Leasing
2.18.1 Company Group as lessee
2.18.1.1 Finance Leases
The ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee, if and only if all risks and benefits associated with the leased asset are transferred to him, independent of the legal form of contract. At the beginning of the leasing period, the asset is recognized at fair value or if lower, at the present value of minimum lease payments including extra payments if any, covered by the lessee. A corresponding amount is recognized as an obligation of the lease irrespective of whether some of the lease payments are made in advance, at the beginning of the lease.

(THE AMOUNTS IN ALL TABLES ARE EXPRESSED IN EURO)

2.18.1.2 Operational Leases All other leases are treated as operating leases. The payments related to operating lease contracts are recognized as an expense in the financial results based on the straight-line method (correlation between revenue and expense). The relative costs, such as maintenance and insurance are recognized as an expense when incurred.
2.18.2 Group Company as Lessor 2.18.2.1 Operational Leases
When the Group does not transfer all risks and benefits of the asset, leases are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred by lessors in negotiating and agreeing an operating lease are added to the book value of the leased asset and recognized, throughout the whole lease period, as rental income.
2.19 Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized to the extent that the economic benefits that will flow into the Group are likely to be measured reliably. Revenues are free of added value tax, discounts and returns. Income among Group's companies, which are consolidated based on the full consolidation method, are entirely eliminated.
The recognition of revenue is as follows:

Investments in affiliated companies in the financial statements of the parent, are subject to an impairment of their value once a year (namely on 31.12 of each year), based on the value in use. In the event that the value in use of cash-generating units is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss equal to the difference is directly recognized.

With regard to the subsidiaries in Asia there are no impairment indications, because their equity is much greater than the participation value and therefore no impairment investigations are in place.

Due to the special market conditions (especially in the last two years), the other subsidiaries (Europe - Greece), are subject to an inspection for potential impairment once a year (namely on 31.12).

In 2017, there were indications for impairment of the subsidiaries. Consequently, provisions which amounted to  3 million were formed. These impairments amounted to  3 million, resulting in a reduction on the financial investment results.
On March 31, 2017, the decision of the Deputy Regional Chief of Eastern Attica (no. 2318/2017 - 31/03/2017)
was registered in the General Commercial Register (GEMI) under the registration number 960017, approving the

A significant part of the increase in inventories derives from the impact of foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of the Group's subsidiaries.

The provision for bad and doubtful receivables has arisen from the individual examination of the ability to repay the balance for each client, taking into account its aging. For customers' balances that require legal action, the legal counsel's assessment was taken into account.

The following tables depict the amounts of provisions and the aging of the balances of trade receivables.

The account "Advances to suppliers" primarily refers to advances given to production units towards the "reliable performance" commitment, the competitive prices of large annual orders and the assurance of privilege discounts when it comes to inventories purchases and the acquisition of the equipment to be established in subsidiaries' points of sales within the region of South Eastern Asia.

The fair value of these receivables is not substantially different from their carrying value.

30.2 Liquidity Risk

Prudent liquidity risk management requires (a) maintaining sufficient cash and (b) the availability of funding through adequate credit lines. Due to the dynamic nature of its activities, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining high unused credit limits in short-term bank loans. The Treasury Department prepares statements of expected future cash flows which are reviewed by management in order to better plan the management of liquidity.

Despite the financial crisis and the limitation of liquidity in a global basis, the Group has maintained increased liquidity, thanks to the retail nature of most of its sales, and takes steps towards the further support its liquidity, by creating discount outlets, in order to dispose old stock, as well as by limiting expenses.

Credit risk It is the risk of default on the part of the counterparty. Retail sales are made in cash through debit and/or credit cards, while in terms of wholesale sales, the Group, based on internal procedures, credits its customers by examining the customer's credit liability. Most of the wholesale sales are made in well-known department stores in the countries in which it operates and in a network of selected franchisees. Additionally, the Company and the Group form provisions for doubtful customers. Finally, according to the Group's policy, part of the receivables from customers is secured.
