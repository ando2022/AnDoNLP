Financial Instruments
Fair Value: The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying statements of financial position for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, prepayments, trade and other accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
The fair value of variable rate loans and borrowings approximate the amounts appearing in the statements of financial position.
The Company categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value in three categories, defined as follows:
· Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) values from active financial markets for identical negotiable assets or liabilities.
· Level 2: Other techniques for which all inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value are identified or determined directly or indirectly from active financial markets.
· Level 3: Techniques that use inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value and are not based on quoted prices from active financial markets.

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.

As at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

Taking into consideration all the above and in accordance with the Environmental Terms of port's operation, PPA S.A. has developed and implements the following procedures for the prevention and control of pollution and environmental impacts:
·Air quality monitoring Program. Since 2009, PPA S.A. has been implementing, in cooperation with the National Technical University of Athens, an integrated program for the monitoring of air pollution through a specialised monitoring station in order to identify, assess and quantify the significant gas emissions of the port and to develop appropriate actions and operational techniques for protecting and improving air quality in the port area. The parameters recorded and monitored are: NOx nitrogen oxide, SO2 sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide CO, heavy metals, PAHs, PM10 particles, BTEX hydrocarbons. At the same time in 2019, the program was enhanced with air emissions simulation and dispersion models for the integration of the assessment of air quality in the port area.
·Sea water quality monitoring Program. PPA S.A. in cooperation with the laboratory of Sanitary technology of Civil Engineering School of National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) applies a seawater quality monitoring program to the entire port area and finds, where applicable, corrective measures.

PPA S.A. highlights the issue by promoting initiatives and behaviors to improve the balance of demand and 25 supply of energy and to reduce energy consumption. In this context, PPA S.A. has installed and operates since August 2016 a photovoltaic power plant producing up to 430 kWp by using solar panels. The photovoltaic plant is connected to the electricity system of DEDDIE S.A. (Administrator of the Greek Electricity Distribution Network).
4. Labor issues
Promoting equal opportunities and protecting diversity are key principles of the Company. Management does not discriminate in recruitment / selection, pay, education, job assignment or any other work activities. The factors that are exclusively taken into account are person's experience, personality, theoretical training, qualifications, efficiency and abilities.

7. Non-Financial Report
A) Description of the PPA S.A. Business Model.
In addition to the Report of the Board of Directors entitled "Analysis of the development & performance of the company's activities and position" and the brief description of the business model that has taken place, the following are stated:
The Piraeus Port Authority S.A. (PPA)
PPA is the legal entity entrusted with the administration and operation of the Port of Piraeus. It was established as a legal entity of public law by virtue of Law 4748/1930, which was restated by Compulsory Law 1559/1950 and ratified by Law 1630/1951, each as subsequently amended and supplemented. In 1999 PPA was transformed into a stock corporation (société anonyme).
Pursuant to the enabling provisions contained in the thirty-fifth article of Law 2932/2001 (Government Gazette A' 145/27.7.2001), the Hellenic Republic and PPA entered into a concession agreement on 13 February 2002 (2002 HRCA). In the 2002 HRCA, the Hellenic Republic granted PPA the exclusive right of use and exploitation of the land, buildings and infrastructure comprising the Port of Piraeus, for an initial term of forty years, and subject to further terms and conditions. Certain amendments to the 2002 Agreement, including the extension of the concession's term by ten years, were authorised on behalf of the Hellenic Republic by virtue of a joint ministerial decision on 19 November 2008 (Government Gazette B' 2372/21.11.2008). These amendments were agreed upon in an addendum to the 2002 Agreement executed 31 between the Hellenic Republic and PPA on 18 November 2008 (the 2008 HRCA). The 2002 Agreement, as amended by the 2008 Addendum (together the Old Concession Agreement), was subsequently ratified by virtue of the first and third article of Law 3654/2008 (Government Gazette A' 57/03.04.2008).
In April 2016, following an open international public tender process, the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), under its capacity as the major shareholder of PPA, and COSCO HK Ltd entered into a Shares Purchase Agreement (hereinafter: SPA) for the acquisition of the majority participation of 51% in the share capital of PPA. In August 2016, after the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, the SPA was affected by the execution of the transaction and the transfer of PPA's majority shares from HRADF to COSCO HK Ltd and PPA S.A. ceased to be a state-owned company and since that day it is a private-owned company.
In the framework of the Privatisation Process and as envisaged and permitted by the Old Concession Agreement (including, without limitation, article 15.1(iii) thereof), the Hellenic Republic and PPA engaged in negotiations, resulting in the finalisation and conclusion of a new amendment of the Old Concession Agreement, which was finally signed by the parties on 29/06/2016 and ratified by law 4404/2016 (Government Gazette A' 126/08.07.2016).
The objective of the Company is to perform its obligations, conduct its activities and exercise its faculties under or in respect of the concession agreement between the Company and the Hellenic Republic dated 13 February 2002 regarding the use and exploitation of certain areas and assets within the Port of Piraeus, as amended and in force (the "Concession Agreement"), in accordance with the law.
For the purpose of attaining its object under paragraph 1 above, the Company may, by way of an illustrative but no means exhaustive list, conduct and engage in the following activities:  (a)use all rights assigned to the Company pursuant to the CA and maintain, utilize and exploit all concession
assets in accordance with the Concession Agreement;  (b)provide services and facilities to vessels, cargo and passengers, including ship berthing and cargo and
passenger handling to and from the port;

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

 (c)install, organize and exploit all kinds of port infrastructure;
 (d)undertake any activities related to the port and all other commercial activities associated with or reasonably incidental to the operation of the port of Piraeus;
 (e)engage third parties to provide any kind of port services;
 (f)award contracts for works;
 (g)engage in such further activities as are prudent or customary for the proper conduct of its business and operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement ; and
 (h)engage in any and all activities, transactions or operations of a type that are conducted by commercial corporations generally.

Evolution of Business Activities

Cruise Activity
PPA S.A.'s outward focus and dedication to cruise attraction policy coupled with increased demand for cruises in the Eastern Mediterranean have contributed to the increase in cruise offerings. Piraeus in 2019 recorded significantly increased volumes of passengers and arrivals compared to 2018. At the passenger level there was an increase in both homeport and transit passengers. In particular, total passenger traffic in 2019 was 1,098,091 compared to 961,632 in 2018, recording a 14.2% increase. Passengers who either begun or ended their cruise in Piraeus (homeport) reached 410,512 against 354,398 in 2018, up 15.8%. Cruise ship arrivals increased by 18.7% to 622 against 524 the year before.

Coastal Traffic

32

Total passenger traffic in the domestic lines in 2019 recorded an increase of 5.7% to 16,551,054 compared to 15,657,368 passengers in 2018. An increase is recorded in all individual routes including the ferry urban connection Perama-Sa-

lamina which recorded a decrease in traffic over the last three years. In particular, coastal services and Ferry urban

connection Perama-Salamina, which account for 85% of total traffic, increased by 7.2% and 3.1% respectively. Growth is

also recorded in the sector of vehicle traffic, despite individual vehicle type variations across all inland routes (2,742,213

in 2019 versus 2,646,189 in 2018).

Car Terminals
Throughput at the car terminals in 2019 decreased by 5.9% due to the reduction in transhipment cargo. Total traffic was 403,757 vehicles versus 429,170 in 2018. It is important to note that the domestic market volumes increased by 3.5% (from 116,737 in 2018 to 120,803) while the transhipment cargo decreased by 9.4% (282,954 units to 312,433 units in 2018). The drop in volume is a result of both reduced demand from the main markets in the astern Mediterranean and in particular Turkey and Egypt and reduced sales in Europe. Despite the overall decrease in traffic, the revenue trend was positive due to the increase in domestic cargo, which confirms the positive outlook for the activity.

Container Terminal
Pier I in 2019 handled 489,430TEU versus 498,708TEU in 2018, recording a marginal decrease of 1.9%. In contrast, an increase of 12.5% was recorded in domestic cargo volume from 95,673TEU in 2018 to 107,608TEU in 2019. The significant increase in domestic traffic has been helped by the improvement of the domestic economic climate and the adoption of more flexible operating structures that allow for a more immediate response to client needs. The transhipment cargo saw a 5.3% decline from 403,035TEU to 381,822TEU in 2019. This decrease is a result of reduced traffic in the first half of the year, which in the second half was significantly reversed as a result of attracting new cargo, which will continue to be served through Pier I in 2020, positively affecting traffic volumes.

Ship Repair Activity
The ship repair sector saw a new growth in 2019 as a result of the investments already made and improvements in tariffs and operating modes. In the dry dock sector, 112 vessels were served in 2019 versus 104 in 2018 (7.7%) while

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

occupancy days declined (3.7%) (from 970 days to 934) as the "Piraeus II" and "Piraeus I" docks were inactive for a long time for maintenance purposes. An increase has also been recorded in the repaired vessels in SRZ, totalling 292 in 2019 against 275 in the previous year.

International Conditions ­ Prospects

PPA S.A. acts as an international trade gate for the Country as well as a transhipment centre for goods primarily for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea regions. The Company's activities depend on the Country's economic conditions, the course of international trade and the geopolitical conditions of the immediate geographical environment.
Significant prospects are created from the adoption of the geopolitical initiative of China for effective transportation between ports of various countries and of China, in the framework of Belt and Road Initiative. In this program is also included a maritime component and Piraeus can benefit from the role of port entry into the EU and from increased connections with other ports.

Cruise Activity

The expected launch of Piraeus Port Expansion Projects funded by the Attica Managing Authority with a budget of 120m for cruise infrastructure is the highlight of the year3. The construction of the new infrastructure, which will increase by two the number of cruise ship berths above 280m, sets the stage for attracting new cruises to the wider area and further developing the market. The project has a construction schedule of 32 months and, in conjunction with the new passenger station on the new infrastructure fully funded by PPA, creates new prospects for the cruise both in Piraeus and the Greek economy in general.

According to CLIA data, the cruise market in 2019 is expected to reach 30m. passengers against 28.5m. in 2018. With-

drawal of capacity and cruises from the eastern region due to the negative geopolitical conditions in Turkey, Syria and

Egypt in recent years has begun reversing slowly but steadily. Already cruise companies have announced cruise starting from Piraeus to Egypt, Turkey and Israel. These services serve as a precursor to the overall revitalization of cruises

33

in the Eastern Mediterranean. Arrivals and cruise ship calls in Greece in 2019, according to ELIME4, recorded an increase

of 15.8% and 14.3% respectively. In this context, the outlook for 2020 based on the 2019 traffic is positive. Cruise ship

reservations for 2020 in Piraeus are already up 14% compared to 2019.

Coastal Traffic
Coastal shipping is mainly influenced by the economic situation in the Country that affects the movement of passengers and cargo to and from the islands and to a lesser extent by the volume of tourists. Passenger traffic to and from the islands is also affected by the intensity of competition between low-cost airlines and ships.
Implementation of the new Regulation for the use of low sulphur fuel creates, according to the representatives of the coastal shipping companies, increased pressure on fares. It is estimated that part of these upward pressures on operating costs will be passed on to fares with a negative impact on transport demand. The precise impact on fares and relatively elastic summer demand cannot be estimated at present and therefore the outlook for 2020 is moderately positive, considering the significant increase in traffic recorded in 2019.

Car Terminals
Seaborne car transport in 2019 is expected to register an 1% increase mainly due to regional transports. EU vehicle sales based on 11-month data show a marginal decrease of 0.3% as four of the five largest markets (Spain, Italy, UK and France) with the exception of Germany, record a decline in passenger car registrations5. In Turkey, which is an impor-

tant market for Piraeus, exports of new cars in the 11-month period dropped 6%6 and imports of cars decreased 33.3%. Reductions were recorded in car sales in both Egypt and Israel. As a result of these facts a reduction in transhipment traffic was recorded in Piraeus. In Greece, on the other hand, passenger car registrations in the 11 months recorded an increase of 9.8%, which contributes positively to the financial result of the Business Unit. This opposite trend of the domestic market is due to the dramatic decline in the registrations during the financial crisis in the country as buyers postponed large purchases and now with the recovery of macroeconomic stability the market is reactivated. In this context, it is estimated that domestic cargo will continue on the upward path in 2020, while transhipment cargo will remain at similar levels to 2019. In the medium term, the EU's stated intention for cleaner vehicles and bans of diesel vehicles in several European cities contributes to the decision to replace cars. Combined with the expected increase in sales of electric cars over the next 5 years, the transhipment volume will increase in the medium term. In the short term, however, the current economic situation in Europe does not allow for a significant increase in vehicle volumes. In the medium term, PPA S.A. plans significant investments to increase storage capacity and capitalize on the recovery of volumes when the economic downturn reverses. The Company has received approval for the construction of a new terminal capacity of 5800 seats and 3-4 berths depending on the ship's length. At the same time, it strengthens the yard management system as well as the implementation of the free zone.
Container Terminal
According to UNCTAD data7 world GDP is expected to grow 2.3% in 2019 versus 3% in 2018. Shipping volumes are projected to increase by 2.6% in 2019 versus 2.7% in 20188. Consequently, both global economic growth and dependent trade are expected to grow in 2019 but at a slower pace than in 2018. The Asia-Europe Route in 20199 is expected to grow 4.9% marginally higher than in 2018. Due to the increase in the volume of trade on the Asia-Europe route, a significant number of ships have been inserted in this route, reducing freights despite the increase in trade volume. 34 For 2020, most estimates report growth rates similar to 2019. However, analysts agree that estimates are based on assumptions that are volatile. The main risks stem from the US-China trade conflict and the vague landscape of the duration and depth of the recent agreement in January 2020. The second challenge stems from a combination of weak trade growth and enforcement of the Regulation for low sulphur content in marine fuels. In times where transportation demand is weak, the opportunity to pass on increased fuel costs is limited and these impacts on shipping companies' profitability, quality of service and the need to streamline routes with fewer main port calls.
In this commercial climate, the advantages of the terminal, such as large natural drafts, 24-hour single tariff operation, tide-free access, good weather and the competitive bunker market, indicate the competitive advantages of Piraeus. These competitive advantages are gaining weight in weak trading conditions and with a growing tendency for alliances between companies that create challenges to ports looking to attract new transhipment cargo. In this context, PPA S.A. aims at enhancing and extending cooperation with existing customers through a flexible demand response regime. In any case, the domestic cargo is expected to increase in the context of the macroeconomic stabilization of the country for which there are positive outlooks.
Ship Repair Activity
Traditionally, Piraeus has significant ship repair activity and know-how. The lack of infrastructure renewal and the loss of competitiveness to neighbouring countries did not allow the industry to maintain a leading role in the region. As a

result, most of the ship repair activity took place in countries such as Turkey and Bulgaria, which appear to offer lower costs but do not offer better know-how from the companies located at the Piraeus Ship Repair Zone (SRZ). On several occasions, based on their knowhow and expertise, companies from Piraeus SRZ undertook ship repairs in other countries.
The activation of the Panamax size floating dock purchased by PPA S.A. and put into operation in the first quarter of 2018, in conjunction with other Ship Repair Zone (SRZ) infrastructure upgrades that are expected to begin in 2020, will enhance the effort to attract ship repairing work which already is recorded positive. In this context, the medium-term outlook for ship repairing in Piraeus is assessed as particularly positive given the political instability in Turkey's directly competitive market.

B) Policies and Due Diligence.

b.1. Policies and Due Diligence for environmental issues

Implementation of Contingency Plans

PPA S.A. implements Emergency Land and Marine Pollution Contingency Plans, approved by the competent Hellenic Ministry, for dealing with oil pollution incidents and other harmful substances in the port area. Emergency situations are fully covered by the aforementioned contingency plans.

In the year 2019, 10 incidents of marine pollution occurred and 3 incidents of land pollution (comparing to 9 incidents in the marine environment and 1 incidence in the land area in 2018) were recorded in the area of competence of PPA S.A. All the incidents were small and were addressed by PPA S.A. directly and effectively.

The sea pollution incidents were related to: oil pollution (6 incidents), identification of Dead Sea turtles (2 incidents) and floating solids pollution (2 incidents). The land pollution incidents were related to oil leakage from machinery (2 inci-

35

dents) and leakage of hazardous container on Pier I (1 incident).

Regulating Issues of Shipwrecks' Lifting / Raising, removal of dangerous and harmful vessels

According to Articles 2, 3 and 5 of Law 2881/2001 "Regulation of wreck raising issues and other provisions", they must be lifted and removed (by the owner of the shipwreck or ship) out of port, in a whole or in parts, or, if required from the circumstances, shifted or destroyed or in any way eliminated, in accordance with the applicable provisions, in order to eliminate any risk and prevent any adverse consequence from the existence of the shipwreck, which constitutes a risk to navigation in the area of port's responsibility, obstructs the mooring, the anchoring, the berthing, the use of docks and generally the port's operation, or harms or threatens to harm the environment:
- shipwrecks, within the meaning of Article 2 of Law 2881/2001, because they are semi-sunk and may cause damage to the rest of the vessels docked in the particular sea area, they disturb the proper operation of the port.
- dangerous and harmful ships in a port, within the meaning of Article 3 of Law 2881/2001, because their overall situation implies a sinking possibility,
- constitute harmful ships due to immobility in a port, within the meaning of Article 5 of Law 2881/2001, that remain stationary and idle without maintenance and diligence in the port area.
In the context of the above Law, an Advisory Committee was established by PPA, on the matters of lifting or elimination of shipwrecks or ships located in the port area of PPA S.A.

b.2.Policies and Due Diligence for safety issues
At high-risk areas (Container Terminal and Perama Ship Repair Zone) the Company provides two ambulances with trained rescue personnel (two rescuers per vehicle) that are available 24/7, to cover emergencies that may occur in the above mentioned areas.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.

PPA's Top Management is committed to ensure the continuing effort to address all risks involved with its operation and undertake all necessary proactive actions.
Risk Management Procedure
PPA S.A. is promoting awareness of risk-based thinking to all its departments in order to protect its values and address uncertainty. Therefore, each business unit is responsible to implement a risk assessment procedure. This procedure includes the following stages: (a)Identification of various organizational, managerial and operational existing and emerging risks that can or could
negatively affect the conformity of services, customer satisfaction, quality policy and objectives, the strategic direction of the company. (b)Evaluation of the nature and level of risk. Significant environmental aspects are also included in the risk assessment and evaluated with a business perspective. Additionally,the impact of environmental aspects to the environment is assessed through the Environmental Aspects Assessment. (c)Determination of the risk's likelihood of occurrence and its consequences. (d)Preparation and implementation of actions to address risks. These actions are proportionate to the potential impact on the conformity of services. Options to address risks may include avoiding risks, taking risk in order to pursue an opportunity, eliminating the risk source, changing the likelihood or consequences, sharing the risk, or retaining the risk by informed decision. (e)Successful integration of actions to address risks into the company's processes according to the significance level of the risk. Identified risks with high and serious significance are being addressed in priority. (f)Evaluation of actions' effectiveness through monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This process is moni- 37 tored by the Quality Control and Inspection Dept through Internal Audits conducted at all Company's Depts. The above procedure is under the coordination of the Quality Control and Inspection Dept which provides support to each department for the compiling, as well as for the necessary review and update of the risk assessment. The review and update takes place at least once a year and always prior to the enforcement of any change, so that the company has early warning of upcoming changes that it needs to react to and plan for. Appropriate documented information as evidence of the results of monitoring and measurement activities regarding the actions taken are retained from each relevant Department and the Quality Control & Inspection Department. During the Management Review by the Top Management, the Quality Control & Inspection Dept presents all necessary information and data on the progress and the effectiveness of the actions taken to address risks. Relevant decisions are being taken by the Top Management. The above procedure is included in PPA's Procedures' Manual that has been approved by Top Management's decision.
Major Risks and Uncertainties.
Wider Economic Environment Maintaining the stable economic environment in the Country is directly related to import and export volumes and, by extension, to the import-export volumes that offer the highest average revenue to the Company. The positive assessments for 2020 and the improvement of the economic climate due to political and tangible factors such as the reduction of certain taxes and the reduction of the country's borrowing costs contribute to the positive economic environment. It is estimated that this strengthening of the economic climate will significantly contribute to the strengthening of import and export volumes and, consequently, to the strengthening of revenues. On the other hand, uncertainties in the wider geographical area of the eastern Mediterranean with the economies of most countries facing challenges combined with the fluid environment of international trade and the tendency to impose tariffs create challenges for the freight forwarding.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Economic instability The geopolitical and economic instability in the countries of North Africa, the Asian Mediterranean and the Black Sea can have a negative effect on the transshipment volumes in Piraeus. The drop of the Turkish lira made more competitive the exports from Turkey and improved the competitiveness of its ports. At the same time, the continued war in Syria and the further involvement of Turkey increases the instability in the region and affects the trade routes and the tourist demand. To mitigate risk, the Company has undertaken a program to develop a rail link with Central Europe and is in the process of seeking customers to expand its port hinterland to the north, thus reducing dependence on maritime markets to the south and south-east.
ew forms of energy The 2020 deadline for the use of low-sulfur fuel (0.5%) puts pressure on shipping companies to choose the most appropriate solution through scrubbers or the use of natural gas. Already in the cruise sector, there are orders for 16 ships of seven cruise lines using natural gas. At the same time, container carriers also have ships with dual fuel capabilities. One of the competitive advantages of Piraeus is the extensive and financially competitive shipping fuel supply market. In this context, the Company, in cooperation with the gas sales and distribution companies of Greece, participates in a European funded project aiming at the study and implementation of competent solutions and infrastructure so that ships in the port can be supplied with natural gas. In this way, the Company aims to maintain its competitive advantage as well as to comply with the regulatory requirements of the European Directives.
Non-expanded clientele (Container terminal)
In the container sector, the most significant risk comes from the high dependence on a single customer (95% of traffic volume). To mitigate risk, the Company has adopted a customer-centric approach while at the same time implements an aggressive policy to attract new customers. However, the intensifying intra-port and international competition pro38 vides limited options for attraction of new cargo in the short-term.
Geopolitical conditions
In the sector of car terminals, the uncertainty of agreement for the exit of UK from the EU is estimated that it can disturb the supply chain for vehicles, as important volume of vehicles for the EU is manufactured in the UK. In the medium term, and according to the developments, there will be alteration of the supply chain as it is probable the transfer of production capacity to the existing centers of central Europe, reinforcing in this way the competitiveness of other ports with proximity to the centers of production. Piraeus which is based mainly to transshipment from Asia due to distance from the centers of production of EU could lose competitiveness. At the same time however, the change of the supply chain provides also opportunities. The Company has intensified the discussions with European and Asian automobile companies in order to present the advantages of Piraeus. At the same time, it has planned significant increase in capacity and invests in mechanical and information technology equipment that will improve the quality of service both to the automobile companies and the shipping companies. In addition, it aims to extend the hinterland by train to the Balkan and Central European countries where automotive factories are located.
In the cruise sector, the most significant risk comes from exogenous factors of geopolitical nature. The Company, to mitigate the impact, aggressively promotes Piraeus to the Chinese market in which it has privileged access due to its parent company, while at the same time informs the internal market about the best ways to attract tourist volume from China.
E) Financial and Non-Financial Performance Indicators.
A detailed presentation of a mixture of general and sectoral indicators took place in the module Business Model - Evolution of Business Activities with a distinct reference to traffic data of each Company's business sector (Cruise, Coastal Shipping, Car Terminal, Container Terminal, and Ship Repair).

Additionally, PPA S.A. has incorporated all non-financial information in its Corporate Responsibility Report 2019, which will be drafted and issued in line with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) international framework (Standards edition). The report will be posted on the company's website (www.olp.gr) in the "Social Responsibility" section.

F.1) Environmental Issues.
PPA S.A. recognizes that the resources consumption must be granted in an efficient way across the port sector. Piraeus' port nature and size favors a high amount of daily energy consumption (e.g. ship-to-shore cranes, terminals lighting, reefer containers, administration buildings, workshops). PPA S.A. raises awareness on the subject by promoting initiatives and behaviors to improve the balance of the demand and supply of energy and to reduce energy consumption.
In this scope, PPA's first photovoltaic station generating energy using solar panels operated in July 2016, generating up to 430 kWp. The photovoltaic Station is linked up to the grid of DEDDIE S.A. Administrator of the Greek Electricity Distribution Network).
PPA S.A. has recognized the need to reduce resource consumption and particularly the energy saving while continuing to provide a secure working environment. Electricity and oil usage has been identified in various energy efficiency reviews as an area for potential reduction. Indicative energy saving measures implemented by PPA S.A. are:
· Staff environmental awareness · Purchasing of electrical equipment with > A energy class and certification · Improvement of buildings' energy efficiency
1. Non- financial indicators for environmental performance The quantities of port -generated domestic and recyclable «blue bins» waste from all premises and activities of PPA S.A. 39 for the years 2018 and 2019 are presented in the Table below.
There is a very slight increase in the amount of waste generated from 2018 to 2019 respectively in both domestic and recyclable waste due to the increase in traffic and port operations.
It is noted that the table below does not include the hazardous and operational waste driven to recovery f the facilities (mainly produced at PPA's workshops).

The waste data and quantities of each company are finalized by submitting the annual Waste Report to the Electronic Waste Register (HMA) at the Ministry of Environment and Energy (submitted for each year until 31 March of the following year). The waste data for the year 2019 listed in this report are not yet finalized by registering at HMA. The waste data for the year 2018 listed in this report are final by registering the 2018 Annual Waste Report at HMA. Furthermore, the finalized waste data including the categories of

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
The above data show that in 2019 marine pollution incidents were respectively as 2018. In any case, in both years, all incidents were small and local and were immediately dealt without any problems, by implementing the contingency plans of PPA S.A.. 3. Results of noise measurements The following table presents the locations and results of noise measurements for the years 2018 and 2019. It is noted that the positions of the measurements are located at the boundary of the ownership of PPA S.A. and are suggested from PPA S.A. acoustical environment Monitoring Program. However, because of the close proximity of the ownership boundaries with the external vehicle routes, the determined measurement positions are greatly affected by out of port traffic. It is also noted that in the school yard of 1st EPAL of Perama (position 05) PPA S.A. has placed sound panels. Replacement of timeworn sound panels was carried out in 2019 for improved performance. Measurements prove the performance of the sound panels [the noise is reduced by 10-15 dB (A)]. It is noticed that the noise levels remain stable without significant changes per position in the last four semesters, as presented at the following diagram.
40
4. Results of air quality monitoring measurements For the year 2019, in preset time there are available figures for the first semester. Data from the first semester of 2019 show the following main conclusions:
· Volatile organic compounds are in low concentrations. The average concentration of benzene is lower than the limit value of 5,0 g m-3 and the rest are at low levers too.
· The suspended particles show a variation in their concentrations. During the measurements the exceedances of the 50 µg / m3 limit are associated with the winter smog due to the combustion of solid fuels (mainly in homes) and the summer season with the transfer of dust from other areas (mainly Africa).
· NO2, SO2, CO did not exceed the average hourly and mean eight hour limits. · The O3 didn't exceed the average daily limit.
hazardous and operational waste will be presented in the PPA' Corporate Responsibility Report.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
In general, the results do not differ from those of the previous measurement period. In 2019, a special study was carried out on the development of atmospheric pollutant models to evaluate the effects of port activities on neighboring areas (adjacent Municipalities) focused on the passenger and commercial port area. The main conclusions of the study by parameter are:
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
Generally NO2 hourly concentrations are relatively higher early in the morning and evening as a result of the combination of high emissions and limited dispersal conditions, with no exceedances of the limits, as proved by the results of the measurements. Generally higher concentrations occur in the passenger port area, except for the early morning hours where relatively higher concentrations occur in the commercial port area.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
In general, SO2 concentrations are low and do not exceed the limits. They are relatively higher early in the morning and at night as a result of the combination of high emissions and limited dispersal conditions, with no exceedances of the limits, which is proved by the results of the measurements. Generally higher concentrations occur in the passenger port area, except in the early morning hours when relatively higher concentrations occur in the commercial port area.
Particles (PM10) 41
In general, particle concentrations are low and do not exceed 20 µg/m3, a finding which agree with the limited quantities of particles emitted during ship movements and their stay in port. The emissions are related to road transport and in particular heavy vehiczle traffic, but also to the operation of port machinery and road traffic around the road network with a corresponding spatial distribution.
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide is emitted in small quantities by maritime transport, resulting in low concentrations. Mostly CO emissions are associated with road transport and emissions from off-road vehicles and machinery. Peak hourly concentrations, throughout the day, are at very low levels compared to existing levels. Comparison of the results of the models with the existing measurements shows that the results of the calculations are in agreement with the measurements and present an 80% correlation coefficient.
5. Complaint Management
One complaint was made about noise nuisance in 2019 and one complaint about noise nuisance in 2018, both focused on the adjacent Container Terminal area. The complaints were submitted by residents of the area neighboring to the Container Terminal specifically of the Neo Ikonio area and they were thoroughly investigated by PPA S.A. Within the framework of implementation of the Acoustic Environment onitoring Program, night- time measurements were performed in positions related to the complaint under representative port operation conditions in line with the complaint and moreover special 24-hours noise measurements were performed at the same area,for further investigation of the issue. The above measurements confined the results of the main Monitoring Program, which seemed to be directly affected by the traffic of Dimokratias Avenue located very near with residences. Especially during the night hours the operation

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

of the port (loading, stowage, Straddle Carriers' movement etc.) becomes audibly perceived to the residences in a lower degree compared to the neighboring street's noise.
Finally the complaint of 2019 was replied in writing with number of protocol 21891/21-05-2019 document of PPA S.A.

Employee Issues

Safety working conditions
In addition to those mentioned in the BoD report on working safety issues, it is noted that the Company recognizes the importance of providing safe conditions and workplaces to the staff and safe conditions of travel - circulation of all involved, tradesmen, passengers etc.
All areas of the port are regularly inspected to ensure that employees comply with health and safety rules of the company and the instructions of those responsible.
PPA S.A. also monitors and controls the compliance of third parties (contractors) with the Occupational Health and Safety legislation, requiring health and safety plans before and during the implementation of technical projects.
For this purpose two safety engineers (one of them exclusively for the Ship Repair Zone, since 2019) and a doctor are employed, reporting any safety issues to the management of the company, in accordance with Law no. 3850/2010. Potential accidents are recorded and investigated, and corrective actions are planned in order not to be repeated. Additionally at high-risk areas (Container Terminal and Perama Shipyards Zone) the Company provides two ambulances with trained rescue personnel that are available 24/7. The company carried out, training of Engineering, Project and Ship Repair Departments personnel on the field of Health and safety (July 2019). The following table illustrates the evolution in the number of accidents, the loss of working days and the number of transits from the Container Terminal premises of the Company.

The 66.7% increase in the number of accidents from 12 in 2018 to 20 in 2019, and at the same time reducing the days of accident due to ELSTAT's ESAW methodology, are attributed:
· to the increase in road accidents on arrival and departure (from 5 in 2018 to 6 in 2019) and · to the reporting through the SEPE electronic platform (www.sepenet.gr) and even pathological incidents (from
2 in 2018 to 16 in 2019).
Leave of absence (parental, sick)
Following to the mentioned in the BoD Management Report, in accordance with the applicable regulations, parental leave for employees in order to attend the school performance of children as well as sick leave is granted. Details are shown in the below tables.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Independent auditor's report
To the Shareholders of "Piraeus Port Authority S.A."
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Our opinion We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Piraeus Port Authority S.A. (Company) which comprise the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2019, the statement of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2019, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union and comply with the statutory requirements of Law 4548/2018.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), as they have been transposed 60 into Greek Law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence During our audit we remained independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) that has been transposed into Greek Law, and the ethical requirements of Law 4449/2017 and of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, that are relevant to the audit of the financial statements in Greece. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with Law 4449/2017, Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 and the requirements of the IESBA Code. We declare that the non-audit services that we have provided to the Company are in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of the applicable law and regulation and that we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided to the Company, in the period from during the year ended as at 31 December 2019, are disclosed in the note 24 to the financial statements.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

Recoverability of Deferred Tax asset calculated on bad debt provision
As described in Note 9, in the non-current assets of the financial statements and specifically in the Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) balance is included a balance of Euro 5,6 million . The most significant part of this DTA (Euro 4,8 million) was recognised on long outstanding trade receivables of approximately Euro 25 million for which a bad debt provision was formed in the IFRS books and records. The company estimates that the tax benefit will be utilised in the future when these receivables will be written off.
We focused on this key audit matter due to the magnitude of this DTA, as well as the significant level of judgement exercised by management for the accounting estimate and the outcome of the actions taken in order to gain the tax benefit from the write off of these receivables in the future.

Our audit approach included the following key procedures:
· For DTA calculated on the bad debt provision balance we have obtained the analysis of outstanding trade receivables that form the basis for the IFRS provision and on which balances, a tax provision will be formed in the future or these balances will be written off.
· We verified the calculation of the deferred tax asset with the appropriate tax rate expected to be applicable at the time (according to management's estimate) that the company will utilize the tax benefit of this bad debt provision.
· For a sample of these trade receivables we reviewed supporting documentation such as analytical ledgers and invoices that support the movement of the accounting balance during the year ended December 31 2019. We also reviewed any new/additional actions taken by management in order to collect those balances.

· We verified the actions taken by management in order to follow up with the tax authorities on the progress of the notice letter submitted in 2017 to the relevant tax authorities. With this letter management had stated their intention to utilize the tax benefit (use the DTA) at the time they will write off the long outstanding receivables.

Based on the work performed, we considered that management's

rationale for the recognition of the DTA on the long outstanding re-

ceivables was supported by the applicable tax legislation at the time

the provision was built. Nevertheless, until such time as a response is

61

received from the Ministry of Finance uncertainty exists as regards the

utilization of the tax benefit.

Contingent liabilities and provisions arising from litigation
The Company faces a number of threatened and actual legal proceedings (see Note 30 Commitments and contingent liabilities par. A and Note 16). The level of provisioning and / or the level of disclosures required involves a high level of judgement resulting in provisions and contingent liabilities being considered as a key audit matter.

Our audit approach included the following key procedures:
· We obtained the analysis of provisions established and we compared them to lists provided by the legal department with no exceptions.
· Where relevant we obtained external legal confirmations directly requested by us.
· We discussed a selection of open cases and their possible outcome with company's legal department and/or external lawyers.
Based on evidence obtained we determined the level of provisioning at December 31, 2019 to be appropriate (Note 16 Provisions). We also consider that disclosures in Note 30 are deemed to be sufficient.

Other Information
The members of the Board of Directors are responsible for the Other Information. The Other Information, which is included in the Annual Report in accordance with Law 3556/2007, is the Statements of Board of Directors members and the Board of Directors Report (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Other Information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this section of our Report, we do not express an audit opinion or other form of assurance thereon.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Other Information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
We considered whether the Board of Directors Report includes the disclosures required by Law 4548/2018 and the Corporate Governance Statement required by article 152 of Law 4548/2018 has been prepared.
Based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit, in our opinion:
· The information given in the Board of Directors' Report for the year ended at 31 December 2019 is consistent with the financial statements,
· The Board of Directors' Report has been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of articles 150 and 151 of Law 4548/2018,
· The Corporate Governance Statement provides the information referred to items c and d of paragraph 1 of article 152 of Law 4548/2018.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified material misstatements in the Board of Directors' Report and Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report. We have nothing to report in this respect.
Responsibilities of Board of Directors and those charged with governance for the financial statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union and comply with the requirements of Law 4548/2018, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the prepa62 ration of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019

1. ESTABLISHMENT AND ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY:

"Piraeus Port Authority S.A." (from now on "PPA S.A." or "Company") was established in 1930 as Civil Law Legal Corporation (C.L.L.C.) by Law 4748/1930, which was revised by L.1559/1950 and was ratified by L.1630/1951 and converted into a Societé Anonyme (S.A.) by Law 2688/1999.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
(a) Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (E.U.). These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost and going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements according to the IFRS requires estimates and assumptions to be made by the management, influencing the assets and liabilities amounts, the disclosure of potential receivable and liabilities as at the financial statements date, as well as the revenue and expenditure amounts, during the financial period. Actual results may differ from these estimations. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the accounting policies which have been adopted. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 2(c).
Management continuously assesses the situation and the possible future impacts in order to ensure that all necessary actions and initiatives are undertaken to minimize possible consequences for the Company's activities. Management cannot accurately forecast the possible developments in the Greek economy; however, based on its assessment, Management has reached the conclusion that no additional impairment provisions of the financial and non-financial assets of the Company are required on December 31, 2019.
Certain line items of the previous year's financial statements were reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation.
71
(b) Approval of Financial Statements
The Board of Directors of the Company approved the financial statements for the year ended at December 31, 2019, on February 20, 2020. The abovementioned financial statements are subject to the final approval of the Annual General Assembly of the Shareholders.
(c) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates
The Company makes estimates and judgments in order to select the most appropriate accounting principles taking into consideration the future outcome of events and transactions. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and judgments that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
(i)Allowance for doubtful accounts receivables and legal cases: Management periodically reassess the adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable following an expected credit losses (`ECLs') approach. The expected loss rate is assessed on the basis of historical credit losses adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive policy and taking into consideration reports from its legal department. For the allowance of legal cases management assesses the probability of negative outcome, as well as possible payment amounts for their settlement.
(ii)Provision for income taxes: According to IAS 12, income tax provisions are based on estimations as to the taxes that shall be paid to the tax authorities and includes the current income tax for each fiscal year, the provision for additional taxes which may arise from future tax audits and the recognition of future tax benefits. The final

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

clearance of income taxes may be different from the relevant amounts which are included in these financial statements.

(iii)Deferred tax assets on provisions of bad debts: Deferred tax assets are recognized for provisions of bad debts to the extent that it is probable that, based on tax law, the Company has the right to proceed with the tax deduction of the related provision. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the particular actions that have been taken (seizure, auction, filling of relevant lists to the tax authorities etc.) in order to record a provision for bad debts.

(iv)Depreciation rates: The Company's assets are depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives. These useful lives are periodically reassessed to determine whether the original period continues to be appropriate. The actual lives of these assets can vary depending on a variety of factors such as technological innovation and maintenance programs.

(v)Impairment of property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When value in use calculations are undertaken, management estimates the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit and chooses a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Company's management having assessed the segment report (Note 22) has identified indications of impairment for Pier I and has used discounted cash flows to calculate the value in use, using cash flow projections from financial budgets covering a period of thirty-three years. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.10%.  sensitivity analysis was performed on positive or negative discount rate changes and revenue of 0.25% and 0.50% respectively.

The value in use was higher than the carrying value of Pier I, consequently, no impairment loss was recog-

72

nized.

(vi)Contingent liabilities: The existence of contingent liabilities requires from management to make assumptions and estimates continuously related to the possibility that future events may or may not occur as well as the effects that those events may have on the activities of the Company.

(vii)P rovision for staff leaving indemnities: The cost for staff leaving indemnities is determined based on actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation requires management to make assumptions about future salary increases, discount rates, mortality rates, etc. Management, at each reporting date when the provision is re-examined, tries to give its best estimate regarding the above mentioned parameters.

(viii)Leases: The Company made a significant estimate on 1 January 2019 to determine the "incremental borrowing rate" that it used to recognize its lease contract with the Greek State because of its special nature. This contract is the Company's main lease agreement (note 3 (c)).

In addition, the Company has made judgments and assessments as to whether the lease agreements in which the Company is a lessor and effective as of January 1, 2019 relate to operating or finance leases. The contracts to which the Company is a lessor relate mainly to the contract with Piraeus Container Terminal S.A. note 3 (t) as well as contracts related to leased areas to ship repair zone. The management's judgment was based mainly on the duration of the leases.

Concerning the contract with Piraeus Container Terminal S.A., management concluded that it is an operating lease due to its duration and because the lease does not substantially transfer the risks and rewards of the right of use.

(ix)Share-based payments, cash-settled: At each reporting date, the Company makes estimates to measure the fair value of the share-based benefit obligation on the data to be included in the relevant valuation model as the dividend yield, expected volatility and free interest-risk. In addition, the Management of the Company, in assessing the fair value of the obligation of the specific benefits, makes estimates regarding the performance

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

of its specific financial figures, as well as estimates regarding the performance of the beneficiaries of those benefits.

3. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company applies the following accounting policies for the preparation of the accompanying financial statements:
(a)Tangible Assets: Buildings, technical projects and other building installations are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and possible impairment provision. The privately owned land, machinery and other equipment, acquired before PPA's conversion into an S.A., 1.6.1999, were valued at deemed cost, arising by the Evaluation Committee of article 9 C.L. 2190/1920, while those acquired afterwards are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and possible value impairment provision.
Acquisition cost of a building installation or equipment consists of purchase price include import duties, plus non-refundable purchase taxes as well as any cost required for the asset to become operational. Repairs and maintenance are posted to the financial period in which they were incurred. Significant additions and improvements made at a later stage are capitalized in the relevant asset cost.
Fixed assets constructed by the Company are posted to the self-construction cost which includes subcontractors' fees, materials and technicians' payroll costs involved in the construction (including relevant employer contributions) as well as part of general administration expenses.
Assets under construction include fixed assets under construction and are stated at their cost. Assets under 73 construction are not depreciated until the fixed assets are complete and operational.

(b)Depreciation: Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis according to the following useful lives per fixed asset category:

Fixed Asset Categories Buildings, technical & port projects Machinery & other equipment Motor Vehicles Floating transportation means Furniture, fixture & fittings

Useful Life (years) 25-40 10-30 5-12 20-35 5-10

The residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method of the Company's assets are examined annually and they are adjusted if necessary.

(c)Impairment of non-current financial assets: Property, plant & equipment and intangible fixed assets must be evaluated for possible impairment loss, when there are indications that the asset's book value is over its recoverable amount. When an asset's book value is over its recoverable amount, the respective impairment loss is posted to the period's financial results. An asset's recoverable value is the greater amount between the fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified separately (cash generating units). Impairment losses recognized in prior periods in non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date for any reversal.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
(d)Investment property: Investment property that includes land and buildings is held by the Company for longterm rental yields and not for own use. Investment property is measured at cost less depreciation and impairment.
When the carrying amounts of the investment property exceed their recoverable amounts, the difference (impairment) is charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income. Land is not depreciated. The depreciation of buildings is calculated using the straight line method over the buildings' useful life which is 30 years.
Transfers are made to investment property when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by the end of owner occupation.
(e)Fixed Asset Subsidies: Subsidies are considered as deferred revenue and are recognized as income at the same depreciation rate as the relevant subsidized fixed assets are depreciated. This income is deducted from the depreciation in the period financial results.
(f)Intangible Assets: Intangible assets include software purchase cost and any expenditure for software development. Software depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis and its useful life of 3-4 years.
(g)Borrowing Cost: The Company has adopted the basic accounting policy suggested by IAS 23, where the borrowing cost recognized as expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
(h)Financial Instruments: Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
i)Financial assets
74 Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets of the Company are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, and fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient, the Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the `solely payments of principal and interest' test and is performed at an instrument level. The Company's business model for managing financial assets refers to how the Company manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

· Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) · Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments) · Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon
derecognition (equity instruments) · Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
This category is the most relevant to the Company. The Company measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
· the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
and · the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. The Company's financial assets at amortised cost include trade and other receivables.

Derecognition of financial asset

75

A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is

derecognised when:

· the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired

or

· the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a `pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

The Company transfers a financial asset if, and only if, it either: · transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset
or · retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement.

When the Company transfers a financial asset, it shall evaluate the extent to which retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.
In this case:
· if the Company transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the entity shall derecognise the financial asset and recognise separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
· if the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Company shall continue to recognise the financial asset.
· if the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, shall determine whether it has retained control of the financial asset. In this case: (i)if the Company has not retained control, it shall derecognise the financial asset and recognise separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer. (ii)if the Company has retained control, it shall continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company recognises an allowance for expected credit losses for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. For trade and other receivables, the Company apply a simplified approach in calculating expected credit losses. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. For other financial assets, the ECL is based on the 12-month ECL. The 12-month ECL is the portion of lifetime ECLs that results from default events on a financial instrument that are possible 76 within 12 months after the reporting date. However, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL. The Company considered the risk of default, the days past due and the historical credit losses experienced adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information per debtor to measure the expected credit losses for each individual trade and other receivable balance. At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly from the initial recognition. The Company considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments past due over the Company's credit policy. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
ii) Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities of the Company are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts.
Subsequent measurement
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income. This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Loans and borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company has the right to defer settlement for at least twelve months from the date of financial position date.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business by suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade account payables subsequent to the initial recognition are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition 77 of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
iii) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(i) Cash on hand and in banks: The Company considers as cash (apart from cash on hand) time deposits and liquid investments maturing in three months from the acquisition date.
Provisions: Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase of the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a borrowing cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date, and if it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, they are reversed. Provisions are used only for expenditures for which they were originally recognized. No provisions are recognized for future operating losses. Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognized.
(k)Income Tax (Current and Deferred): Current and deferred income tax assessment are based on the relevant amounts of the financial statements, according to tax Laws effective in Greece. Current income tax concerns tax on the Company taxable profits, adjusted according to Greek tax Law and calculated using the current tax

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
rate. Deferred tax is assessed using the liability method in all temporary tax differences on the balance-sheet date between the tax base and the accounting value of assets and liabilities. The expected tax consequences from the temporary tax differences are assessed and stated either as deferred tax liabilities or as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are posted to the financial statements for all allowable temporary differences and tax losses carried forward as far as it is likely to set off these allowable temporary differences against available taxable profits.
The accounting value of deferred tax assets is revised at each balance- sheet date and it is reduced up to the point that it is not likely to have enough taxable profits, where part or all of the deferred tax assets may be set off against. Current income tax receivable and liabilities for current and previous financial years are valued at the amount expected to be paid to Tax Authorities (or be refunded by them), using the tax rates (and tax Laws) in force up to the balance- sheet date.
(l)Revenue Recognition: Revenue is the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring promised services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (value-added tax, other sales taxes etc.).
Revenue is recognized when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of a promised service to the customer. A customer obtains control of a service if it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that service. Control is transferred over time or at a point in time when the service is provided to the customer.
Management has determined that contracts in general comprise of a single performance obligation and prices are fixed, based on stand-alone selling prices derived from price lists. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the service is provided to the customer.
78
Revenue arising from services is recognised at a point in the time in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, and it is measured based on stand-alone selling prices derived from price lists.
A receivable is recognised when there is an unconditional right to consideration for the performance obligations to the customer that is satisfied.
A contract asset is recognized when the performance obligation to the customer is satisfied before the customers pays or before payment is due, usually when services are transferred to the customer before the Company has a right to invoice.
A contract liability is recognized when there is an obligation to transfer services to a customer for whom the Company has received consideration from the customer (prepayments) or there is an unconditional right to receive consideration before the Company transfers a service (deferred income). The contract liability is derecognized when the promise is fulfilled and revenue is recorded in the profit or loss statement.
(m)Inventories: Materials and spare parts related to the Company mechanical equipment maintenance are valued at the lower of acquisition cost and net realisable value and their cost is determined on the weighted average cost basis. Net realizable value is estimated based on the current selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses. Materials are posted to inventories on purchase and recognized as expenditure on consumption.
(n) L eases:
 a) Company as lessee
Until the 2018 financial year, leases were classified as either finance or operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
From 1 January 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Company.
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: · fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable, · variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, · amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, · the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and · payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate can not be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.
After the commencement date, the lease liability is measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The lease liability is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.
The Company elected to use the on-going recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option (short-term leases), 79 and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (low-value assets). Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.
Finally, the Company chose not to separate the non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets to which the right of use relates.
 Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: · the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability, · any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, · any initial direct costs, and · an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
When the right-of-use asset meets the definition of investment property, it is initially measured at cost, and subsequently measured at fair value, in accordance with the Company's accounting policy.

 b) Company as lessor

The leases in which the Company is a lessor relate solely to sub-leases and are classified as finance or operating. The Company's sub-lease agreements at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 relate exclusively to operating leases.

Revenue from rental income arising, from operating leases, is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

The Company reflects the future tax impacts of leases and recognises deferred tax. When recognising deferred tax, the Company has assessed the lease asset and lease liability together as a single or `integrally linked' transaction and assessed the net temporary difference.

(o)Defined benefit plan: The provision for staff termination indemnities recorded in the statement of financial position for the defined benefit plan is the present value of the liability for the defined benefit in addition to changes occurring from any other actuarial profit or loss and the past service cost. The discount rate is considered as the yield, at the balance sheet date, of high quality European corporate bonds which have a maturity which approaches the time period of the Company's liability.

The liability for this plan is determined using the projected unit credit method from an independent valuer and includes the present value of accrued services during the year, the interest on future liabilities, the prior service cost and the actuarial gains or losses.

Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net in-

terest and the return on plan assets, are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position with a

80

corresponding debit or credit to the actuarial differences through other comprehensive income in the period in

which they occur. Remeasurements are not classified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of:

· The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and

· The date that the Company recognizes restructuring-related costs

According to the Collective Agreement, employees of PPA S.A. (effective from 1/1/2018, article 8), employee who fulfills retirement conditions, leaving the Company, is entitled to a retirement allowance of  30.000.

According to the Collective Agreement Port Workers (dated 1/7/2019, article 6,) an employee who fulfills retirement conditions, leaving the Company, is entitled to a retirement allowance of  30,000.

According to the SAE of Supervisors / Planners of PPA S.A. (effective from 1/4/2019, article 8,) employee who fulfills retirement conditions, leaving the Company is entitled to receive a retirement allowance of  30,000.

(p)National Insurance Programs: The obligation for main or supplementary pension provision is covered by the main National Insurance Department (IKA- Social Insurance Institute) which concerns private sector and provides retirement, medical and pharmaceutical services. Each employee is obliged to contribute part of his salary to the National Insurance Department, while part of the total contribution is paid by the Company. On employees retirement the National Insurance Department is responsible for their pension payments. Therefore, the Company has no legal or presumed obligation for future payments according to this program.

The employees of PPA are entitled upon retirement an allowance from the Unified Fund for Supplementary Benefits and Lump-sum Benefits (P) according to the statutory provisions of the Fund and the Law N. 2084/92.

For the two welfare sectors, dockworkers and employees of PPA, the granted amount is currently determined on the basis of the provisions of article 35 of Law N.4387 / 12-05-2016 (FEK), considering the average of the total

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
remuneration ­ without accounting holiday bonus - on which were calculated social insurance contributions for welfare for the five-year period 2009-2013 and with the employee's work year experience until 31/12/2013.
To this amount is added the total of insurance contributions for welfare from 01/01/2014 and afterwards. Every employee is required to contribute a part of his monthly salary to the fund, while part of the total contribution is covered by the Company.
This fund is a legal public company and is responsible for paying the above benefits to employees. Consequently, the Company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay future benefits under this plan.
(q)Earnings per Share: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the financial period net profit, corresponding to ordinary shareholders, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares issued. The accompanying financial statements did not include any profit decreasing bonds or other stock, convertible to shares. Consequently, diluted earnings per share were not calculated.
(r)Dividends: Dividends are accounted for when receipt rights are finalized by the resolution of the shareholders general meeting.
(s)Concession Agreement to PPA S.A.: In persuasion of the 35th article of 2932/2001 Law, Greek Government and the Company signed on 13.2.2002 the Concession Agreement, by which the government transfers its exclusive right of use and exploitation of port zone lands, buildings and facilities of Piraeus Port to the Company.
This concession was agreed for fixed period initial duration of 40 years, beginning on the day the agreement and ending on 13.2.2042. The initial duration is possible to be extended once or several times by Law with new written agreement and modification of the 4.1 article of the Concession Agreement. With the Common Ministry Decision (CMD) no. 8322/3-12-2008, published in Government Paper 2372/21-11-2008, the Concession Agreement duration has been modified from 40 to 50 years, beginning on the 13/2/2002 (initial signature date) and 81 ending on the respective date of the year 2052.
Management has examined whether the contract for the concession of the exclusive right to use and exploit land, buildings and facilities at the Port of Piraeus Land Zone fall under the scope of the provisions of Interpretation 12. Management concluded that the concession does not fall under the scope of application of Interpretation 12, as it is a lease contract. As described in note 5, the contract, due to the adoption of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, recognized as right-of use asset.
Government has received 1% of the Company's consolidated annual income for each of the first 3 years of the concession. The above percentage has increased to 2% of the Company's consolidated annual income after the 3rd year, on the same calculation basis. Based on the new Concession Agreement signed on 24.6.2016 the percentage to Greek State has increased to 3.5% of the Company's consolidated annual income excluding finance income, with fixed minimum fee amounted to  3.5 million.
Until 2018, the concession consideration was fully recognized in the expenses and the liability was included in Accrued and Other Current Liabilities (Note 20). As of 1/1/2019, due to the adoption of IFRS 16, in the expenses is recorded only the variable amount of the concession fee while the fixed minimum fee is included to the rightof-use assets and lease liability (Note 5).
The Company most significant obligations arising from this agreement are:
· Constant rendering of port services
· Responsibility for the installation, improvement and maintenance of the security level in Piraeus Port.
· Ensure fair deal to all port users
· Payment of maintenance expenditure for all the property included in the Concession Agreement

(t)Concession Agreement of Piers II and III with COSCO Pacific Ltd (currently COSCO Shipping Port Ltd): The Law 3755/2009 ratified by the Parliament ruled the concession of use and operation of Piers II and III between the Company and COSCO Pacific Ltd. The contract term provided for 35 years at fair value of  4.3 billion, of which 79% is guaranteed by future income and additional investment at  620 million to be implemented. The Concession Agreement entered into force on 1/10/2009 and till 31/5/2010 the operation of Pier II was provided by the staff of the Company as a subcontractor. Within this period the project in Pier I, which was constructed by the Company, was completed and started its operation by providing services directly to Company's clients.
The Agreement B. Modification of the original Concession Agreement (OG 52 / 30.03.2009) between the Company and PCT S.A., following the `Practical Process Amicable Settlement', has been published in the Government Gazette 269 / 24.12.2014.
According to the above, the payment of the guaranteed consideration was suspended until 31.12.2021 and has been replaced by paying only Variable consideration that arises as a percentage on consolidated revenues of PCT S.A. from the previous contract year.

The calculation of fixed consideration I & II is adjusted regarding the length of exploitation and the corresponding sq. m. (Note 21). The concession consideration is calculated and recognized in income for the period, in accordance with the terms of the contract and considered as lease contract based on IAS 17 and IFRS 16 (Notes 2c and 3(n)).

The payment of Variable Consideration is performed on a monthly basis in arrears and the payment of the Standard Exchange every six months in advance (Note 21).

(u)The Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company's shareholders on September 23, 2019 approved the long-

term incentive bonus plan, which is cash settled of a certain number of Units. Beneficiaries of the program are

members of the Board of Directors, senior executives and other key management and business executives.

The amount payable to the beneficiaries is determined by the increase in the share price from the grant date

(8/10/2019:  22.53) and the redemption date. In addition, the redemption of the Units depends on the achieve-

ment of predetermined performance criteria of the Company and the Beneficiaries.

The Company in accordance with IFRS 2 measures the services it obtains and the liability it undertakes at the fair value of the liability. Until the settlement of the liability, the entity shall remeasure the fair value of the liability at the reporting date as well as at the settlement date, and any changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss for the period. The obligation is measured, initially and at each reporting date until the final settlement, at the fair value of the units on the increase in the share price from the grant date and the respective redemption date, with the application of a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions under which the units have been granted. The fair value of the long-term reward plan at December 31, 2019 was determined using the Binomial model taking into account the share price, the expected volatility of the share, the dividend yield as well as the free interest rate (Note 28) and the liability is recognized in other long-term liabilities.

(v)Foreign Currency Conversion: All the operations of the Company are all performed in Euro. Transactions made in foreign currencies are converted into Euro using exchange rates effective at transaction date. Receivable and liabilities in foreign currency are adjusted at the financial statements preparation date in order to state the exchange rates effective at that date. Gains or losses arising from these adjustments are included in the Statement of comprehensive income as foreign exchange gains or losses.

Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the annual financial statements, are consistent with those followed for the year ended December 31, 2018, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations applicable for

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
fiscal periods beginning at January 1, 2019. However, those standards have either no significant effect on the Financial Statement of the Company, or no application for the Company. New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations: Certain new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued which are mandatory for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Company's evaluation of the effect of these new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations is as follows:
Standards and Interpretations effective for the current financial year
IFRS 16 "Leases"
IFRS 16 has been issued in January 2016 (effective January 1, 2019) and supersedes IAS 17. The objective of the standard is to ensure that the lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. The Company has adopted IFRS 16 retrospectively from 1 January 2019, but has not restated comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2019. There is no impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in respect of the arrangements where the Company acts as a lessor, while the effect of this standard for the arrangements where the Company acts as a lessee is disclosed in detail in Note 5. The accounting policy in relation with lease contracts is described in note 3(n).
83 IFRS 9 (Amendments) "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation"
The amendments allow companies to measure particular prepayable financial assets with so-called negative compensation at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income if a specified condition is met--instead of at fair value through profit or loss.
IAS 28 (Amendments) "Long term interests in associates and joint ventures"
The amendments clarify that companies account for long-term interests in an associate or joint venture--to which the equity method is not applied--using IFRS 9.
IFRIC 23 "Uncertainty over income tax treatments"
The interpretation explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. IFRIC 23 applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is such uncertainty, including taxable profit or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.
IAS 19 (Amendments) "Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement"
The amendments specify how companies determine pension expenses when changes to a defined benefit pension plan occur.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Annual Improvements to IFRS (2015 ­ 2017 Cycle) The amendments set out below include changes to four IFRSs.
IFRS 3 "Business combinations"
The amendments clarify that a company remeasures its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains control of the business.
IFRS 11 "Joint arrangements"
The amendments clarify that a company does not remeasure its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains joint control of the business.
IAS 12 "Income taxes"
The amendments clarify that a company accounts for all income tax consequences of dividend payments in the same way.
IAS 23 "Borrowing costs"
The amendments clarify that a company treats as part of general borrowings any borrowing originally made to develop an asset when the asset is ready for its intended use or sale.
Standards and Interpretations effective for subsequent periods
84 IFRS 17 "Insurance contracts" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021). IFRS 17 has been issued in May 2017 and supersedes IFRS 4. IFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard and its objective is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. The new standard solves the comparison problems created by IFRS 4 by requiring all insurance contracts to be accounted for in a consistent manner. Insurance obligations will be accounted for using current values instead of historical cost. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. IFRS 3 (Amendments) "Definition of a business" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amended definition emphasizes that the output of a business is to provide goods and services to customers, whereas the previous definition focused on returns in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits to investors and others. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. IAS 1 and IAS 8 (Amendments) "Definition of a material" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments clarify the definition of material and how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance which until now was featured elsewhere in IFRS. In addition, the explanations accompanying the definition have been improved. Finally, the amendments ensure that the definition of material is consistent across all IFRS. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (Amendments) `Interest rate benchmark reform' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments modify some specific hedge accounting requirements to provide relief from potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the IBOR reform. In addition, the amendments require companies to provide additional information to investors about their hedging relationships which are directly affected by these uncertainties. IAS 1 (Amendment) `Classification of liabilities as current or non-current' (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022). The amendment clarifies that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current depend-

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A.
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT for the year ended December 31, 2019 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
ing on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date. The amendment also clarifies what IAS 1 means when it refers to the `settlement' of a liability. The amendment has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

Main leasing activities and new accounting policy
The major contract for the Company is with the Greek State for the concession to the exclusive right of use and exploitation of port zone land, buildings and facilities of Piraeus Port ("Concession agreement with the Greek State") granted to the Company until 13/2/2052, in exchange of an annual percentage payment based on Company's income with a minimum annual fee of  3.5 million (Note 2(s)).
Additionally, the Company has various lease contracts for motor vehicles, executive houses and other equipment. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 1 to 3 years, but may have extension or termination options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. Leases for house rentals and other equipment have been categorized as short-term contracts and therefore are not included in the above right-of-use assets.

Adoption of IFRS 16 and its effect on January 1, 2019
On December 31, 2018, the Company had only operating leases as a lessee. For these leases the Company due to the adoption of IFRS 16 recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019. Right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability.
The lease liabilities on 1 January 2019 can be reconciled to the operating lease commitments on 31.12.2018 as follows:

Operating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018

119,324,549.72

Weighted average incremental borrowing rate on 1.1.2019

3.80%

Discounted commitments using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at

the date of initial application 88
(Less): short-term leases recognised on a straight-line basis as expense

64,994,611.34 (51,454.54)

(Less): adjustments as a result of a different treatment of extension and

termination options

(30,692.67)

Lease liability recognized on 1.1.2019

64,912,464.13

Of which:

Long-term lease liabilities

64,843,310.99

Short-term lease liabilities

69,153.14

The Company has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:
· reliance on its assessment made by applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at the date of initial application,
· the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics,
· the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January 2019, as short-term leases,
· the exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application, and
· the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.
The Company had no impact on the application of the standard as a lessor. The Company reviewed the relevant contracts and concluded that relates to finance leases.
The judgments and estimates of the Company regarding the application of IFRS 16 are described in note 2 (c).

Receivables from project contractor of Pier I: This claim represents the difference found in incorrect data application on some review rates of the Ministry of Environment (IPEXODE) and was recognized by the project contractor of Pier I. At March 9, 2012 the Company and the project contractor of Pier I consigned an "extrajudicial agreement of debt acknowledgment", under which the requirement from the later would be paid in seven (7) instalments up to December 31, 92 2012. Then on the 24th of September, 2012, the request of the contractor of the project "Pier I' was partially approved and the debt settled in fourteen (14) monthly instalments starting from September 30, 2012 onwards until October 31, 2013.
Due to non-compliance of settlement, the PPA held in October 2013 in forfeiture contractor's guarantee letters for accrued interest of  1.5 million and is expected to debate the re-settlement agreement instalments.
Furthermore, due to this non-compliance of settlement, the Company, through its Board of Directors, decided on the 24th of February 2014 to exercise any remedy and recourse to any procedure for the forced recovery of its claim.
Receivable from compulsory seizure of Municipality: The Municipality of Piraeus proceeded to the compulsory seizure of the amount of  6,285,940.08 against the Company, for municipal charges of cleaning and lighting as well as electrified land taxes over the past years that were imposed on the Company (Note 11). After the final court decisions, the Municipality of Piraeus returned immediately on January 29, 2018 the amount of  4,608,844.90.

The Company's Legal Department estimates that the amount of  82,831.81 will be received in 2020 and that amount is transferred to other short-term receivables (Note 11).

9. INCOME TAX (CURRENT AND DEFERRED)

For the year 2018 the applicable tax rate was 28%. Article 22 of Law 4646/2019 amended Paragraph 1 of Article 58 of Law 4172/2013 to reduce the tax rate for on business profits. Under that provision, for the fiscal year 2019 onwards, the corporate income tax rate on business profits is reduced from twenty-eight (28%) to twenty-four percent (24%).

Greek tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretations by the tax authorities. Tax returns are filed annually but the profits or losses declared for tax purposes remain provisional until such time, as the tax authorities examine the returns and the records of the taxpayer and a final assessment is issued. Tax losses, to the extent accepted by the tax authorities, can be used to offset profits of the five fiscal years following the fiscal year to which they relate.
Tax Compliance certificate:
From the financial year 2011 and onwards, all Greek Societés Anonymes and Limited Liability Companies that are required to prepare audited statutory financial statements must, in addition, obtain an "Annual Tax Certificate" as provided by Article 65 of L.4174/2013. This "Annual Tax Certificate" must be issued by the same statutory auditor or audit firm that issues the audit opinion on the statutory financial statements. Upon completion of the tax audit, the statutory auditor or audit firm must issue to the entity a "Tax Compliance Report" which will subsequently be submitted electronically to the Ministry of Finance, by the statutory auditor or audit firm. For tax years commencing from 1/1/2016 onwards, the tax compliance report becomes optional according to the provisions of Law 4410/2016.

The deferred tax asset balance has been built mainly in previous years (before 2016) when the Company was operating under specific legislation Law 1559/1950 and Law 2688/1999. According to these the Company believes that they have taken the ultimate possible measure for collecting a long outstanding receivable balance which is to assign those balances to tax department for collection. For such balances of  25 million for which the Company has recorded  4.8 million deferred tax asset, the Company intends to utilize this deferred asset when they will write off these balances in the future. That intention was declared in a notice letter to the Ministry of Finance but no response has been received yet. A response is critical for any future action to be determined by the Company.

(41,116.80) 39,218,306.26

On 1 January 2018, the Company applied the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses (ECLs) on the trade and other receivables balances at the date of initial application. The result of the new requirements was an increase in the Company's impairment allowances of  138,455.83 with a corresponding impact in the opening retained earnings.

The reversal of the provision of  1,601,292.57 concerns two customers who, during the current period, repaid part of their debt and for which provision for doubtful debts had been made in prior years.

The provision utilized for the current year of  126,722.60 and  41,116.80 (in prior year) relates to the write-off of a customer's debt based on a decision of the Board of Directors and Managing Director respectively and for which a provision for doubtful debts had been made in a previous year.

96

For trade receivables and other receivables, the Company has calculated estimated credit losses (ECLs) based on lifetime expected credit losses. Taking into consideration that trade receivables are normally settled within 10 days from

the issuance of the invoice, the risk of default and the expected loss rate of 0.5% has been determined by management,

whereas for all balances that are outstanding for more than 10 days, the Company has considered the risk of default, the

days past due and the historical credit losses experienced adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information

per debtor to measure the expected credit losses for each individual trade receivable balance.

The ageing analysis of trade receivables (net of ECLs) is as follows:

22.SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company operates in Greece, regardless of the fact that its clientele includes international companies. Additionally, the Company has no other commercial or industrial activities other than the provision of services solely in the port area and does not have income or assets from foreign customers (based on the geographical area in which they operate).

The port of Piraeus is a port of complex activities, operating in many sectors of port activity, such as containers, Car-terminal, coastal shipping, cruise, Ro-Ro, ship repair, environmental and logistics services.

It is the main port of coastal shipping connecting mainland Greece with the islands, the main cruise ship port service in the country, the main container port and the main car ­ terminal port of the country.

PPA S.A. provides all the requested port services: water supply, marine fuels, solid and liquid slot tankers, jack residual oil, electricity, fiber optics and internet, victuals, repairs, environmental services and is fully connected to all activities with modern computer systems.

The management of PPA S.A. monitors at the level of results of the above activities and takes business decisions based on the implemented internal management information system.

Based on the above and in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8, the Company has determined to disclose the following segments:

· Container Terminal

· Car Handling

· Coastal Shipping

· Cruise

106

· Ship Repair

· Other segments (water supply, property management, merchandise management).

The other segments include activities representing less than 10 % of total revenue and profit in all segments and therefore are not disclosed as separate operating segments.

At the Company level are included revenues and expenses that are not allocated by operating segment, because management monitors them at entity level.

Management does not take business decisions and does not monitor periodically the assets and liabilities of the business sectors and for this reason does not make the relevant disclosures as required by the provisions of IFRS 8.

32.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value: The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying sheets of financial position for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, prepayments, trade and other accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities, approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

The fair value of variable rate loans and borrowings approximate the amounts appearing in the statements of financial position.

The Company categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value in three categories, defined as follows:

Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) values from active financial markets for identical negotiable assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Other techniques for which all inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value are identified or determined directly or indirectly from active financial markets.

Level 3: Techniques that use inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value and are not based on quoted prices from active financial markets.

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.

As at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held the following financial instruments:

Interest rate risk: The Company bank loans are expressed in Euro and are subject to floating interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives in financial instruments in order to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk fluctuation as at the balance-sheet date. The Company management believes that there is no significant risk resulting from a possible interest rate fluctuation.
