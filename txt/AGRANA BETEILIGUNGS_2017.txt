  Our many years of experience, our know-how, the responsibility for people and nature, the ability to react swiftly to market changes and customer needs, the diversity in our products, the skill and resources to identify and develop new markets, and the ex- ploiting of synergies in the three business segments Sugar, Starch and Fruit ...
...all these make AGRANA
strong and profitable
 
                                                STRONG AND PROFITABLE
                                                                                                                         
    SYNERGIES
make us
strong and profitable
We are more than the sum of our three segments Sugar, Starch and Fruit. We leverage synergies and, by diversifying risks, generate a degree of stability that is without equal in the market. Possible short-term weaknesses in one segment are balanced by strengths in the other segments. This sym- biosis of three strong pillars is unique to AGRANA and gives the Group a critical competitive advantage, both now and especially going forward.
 
 
 
    SPECIALISATION
makes us
strong and profitable
With our specialties strategy we will continue to develop new markets and ensure growth.
In the Starch segment, AGRANA both strives for even higher levels of value-added refining, and is already successfully positioned in the market with starch specialties such as clean label, organic, and GMO-free starches. In the fruit juice concentrate business as well, we continue the consistent exe- cution of our specialties strategy (with beverage bases and the expansion of aroma capabilities).
Specialisation is also pursued in the Sugar segment, where it means a stronger positioning as a supplier of a very diverse range of sugar products and as the leading organic sugar pro- ducer in Europe. In addition to being a dependable, trusted partner to the sugar-using industry, we deliver pleasant taste to consumers through our retail products.
 
    INVESTMENT
makes us
strong and profitable
Worldwide capital investment strengthens AGRANA’s market position.
We go where the global growth in the Fruit segment is and are expanding our production capacity in fruit preparations. The integration of the Argentine company Main Process S.A. is complete. The construction of the new, second plant of AGRANA Fruit in China, in the greater Shanghai area, has be- gun and is scheduled for completion at the end of 2018. And the purchase of a fruit preparations plant in India is another step in AGRANA’s expansion in the Asian growth market.
AGRANA’s answer to the rising demand for starch, which is driven by the high share of recycled paper and the growing packaging needs of the online mail order market, is the doubling of the wheat starch capacity in Pischelsdorf, Austria. As well, in the 2017|18 financial year the corn starch factory in Aschach, Austria, through its own capacity expansion, in- creased its grinding volume to more than 500,000 tonnes of corn per year.
 
 
 
    RESPONSIBILITY
makes us
strong and profitable
Our business success is also the fruit of our responsible, sustainable relationships with people and nature. We not only practice sustainability in our own business activities but are also establishing it in our supply chain. External audits in accordance with the standards of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) were conducted for the first time in the 2017|18 financial year at contract growers of agricultural crops for several business segments. The audits confirm that a large majority of AGRANA suppliers follow environmentally and socially sustainable practices. In order to further raise awareness among all our suppliers for the importance of eco- logically and socially sound production methods, last year we expanded the presentation of the AGRANA Sustainability Award for contract growers to all categories of raw materials.
 
    EXPERIENCE
makes us
strong and profitable
The formal qualifications, the experience and pioneering spirit of our approximately 8,700 employees at 581 production sites around the world inform our innovation, our continual product enhancements and the discovery of new products, and thus ensure the development of new markets.
AGRANA as a global company recognises its responsibility to people. We strive for continuous further improvement in our human resource activities. Thus, a number of initiatives were launched in the 2017|18 financial year, including prepa- rations for the future implementation of a global human resource management system.

ANNUAL REPORT
2017|18
of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG
for the year ended 28 February 2018
 AGRANA fulfils its obligation under the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (also known in German as NaDiVeG) to prepare a non-financial information statement in accordance with section 267a Austrian Commercial Code. This statement is provided from page 41. It is based on the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. In this report on the 2017|18 financial year, the reporting of the sustainability topics that are material to AGRANA’s business activities is integrated directly in
the corporate governance report and Group management report. To make the non-financial information easier to find, the relevant passages are cross-referenced in the non-financial information statement, and a content index of all GRI disclosures that are included in the report is provided from page 179. In addition, relevant passages are marked with a green fingerprint on the respective pages.

Letter from the CEO
 In the completed 2017|18 financial year we achieved a further significant improvement in operating profit (EBIT) at Group level. The Starch and Fruit segments reached new all-time highs in EBIT, which tells us that our growth and specialties strategy is working. We will consistently continue to execute this strategy of expanding our capacity and investing in even greater refining intensity. Our Sugar segment, thanks to a very good performance in the first half of 2017|18, also delivered an EBIT improve- ment. Since the second half of the year, however, the impacts of the new environment in the EU
are making themselves felt.
Taking up challenges – unity makes us strong and profitable
The AGRANA strategy of diversification across three pillars will prove its worth in 2018|19. Since
1 October 2017 there are no longer any quotas for the Sugar segment. Greater competition within Europe amid a more than adequately supplied EU market, higher world sugar stocks and lower world market prices led to massive downward pressure on prices and margins since the quota expiration. Besides the fact that we will meet the coming challenges through the expansion of our strong market position, a systematic brand-name product strategy and greater centralisation of administrative functions throughout the AGRANA Sugar segment, our diversification into three business segments will offer stability, as the Starch and Fruit segments provide solid support for the Group’s earnings.
Specialisation and customised solutions act as growth drivers
In 2017|18 we successfully brought the expansion of the starch plant in Aschach, Austria, on stream, which has increased the Starch segment’s capacity for specialty corn starches and enables maltodex- trins to be produced on site. In the fruit juice concentrate business as well, we purposefully continue to execute our specialties strategy (with beverage bases and the broadening of aroma capabilities).
Besides the unique selling point of products free from genetically modified ingredients, specialisa- tion for AGRANA also means a further expansion in organics activities. In the past several years
we have more than doubled the sales volume of organic products in the Sugar and Starch segments. We plan to further step up the superior growth in this higher-margin business area.
Responsibility makes us strong and profitable
Responsibility for people and nature is central to our understanding of sustainability. We honour this responsibility not just in our own production processes and by auditing our contract suppliers, but especially also in our products. At AGRANA we cater for modern nutritional trends such as GMO-free1 and organic products for human and animal nutrition and also rely on clean label tech- nologies, i.e., production without chemical additives. For example, our goal is to replace the market’s GMO soybean imports with premium GMO-free protein feed from our wheat starch and ethanol production in Pischelsdorf, Austria. Through the expansion of our wheat starch plant at this site
we also aim to heighten the recyclability of paper and carton board (this requires the type of starch that we make) and thus to generate additional environmental benefit.
  14 1 GMO-free or GM-free: not derived from genetically modified organisms.

Regarding energy efficiency, since the year 2000 we have reduced energy consumption in sugar production by about 30%. In the interest of climate protection, we believe the proportion of ethanol in blended petrol should be not just 5% but 10%. In Austria this would save a further 190,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year
and reduce particulate pollution from petrol engines
by a demonstrable1 20%.
Fair discussion on nutrition
AGRANA seeks a fact-based dialogue on nutrition. It is
an indisputable fact that the number of overweight people is rising despite reduced sugar consumption. We therefore actively support the communication of nutritional and health knowledge from the preschool age and also make a point of furthering the promotion of physical activity. On the subject of reformulation of product recipes,
we would like to point out that the focus of such efforts should not be on individual nutrients but on calorie reduction. From 2018|19 we are, for instance, producing a new potato fibre product as a component for low-calorie products (which also reflects our principle of utilising 100% of raw materials). A reduction in the consumption
of nutrients like sugar and fat alone will not be effective
if it does not lead to a lower energy intake.
Investments in know-how and factories
make us strong and profitable
Investments in employees, in research and development and in production facilities set the stage for our continu- ing success.
Our employees are the crucial success factor for the Group’s further profitable growth. Quite apart from the fact that, without our employees, our factories would only be halls of reinforced concrete with machinery in them, our specialties strategy does not require economies
of scale so much as “economies of ingenuity” – the entire growth in our range of specialty products is driven by our staff. The growth in the Fruit segment as well is not based merely on building new plants but is also powered by
the ability of our people to successfully address customers outside the dairy sector, too, such as in the ice-cream and baking industry.
Concerning our capital investment in plants, in 2017|18, besides the already mentioned expansion of the Starch activities in Austria, we continued to go where the global growth in the Fruit segment is, with various projects including facility expansions. Thus, the integration of the Argentine company Main Process S.A. was completed
and the production of fruit preparations in Argentina is now concentrated at this new site. In India, in addition to the existing production of mango puree, we are starting to produce fruit preparations as well.
Prompted by the attractive market growth in Asia, the third quarter of 2017|18 saw the groundbreaking for
the new, second fruit preparations plant of AGRANA Fruit in China, which is to begin operation at the end of 2018. This Fruit segment project as well as the capacity expansion at the potato starch factory in Gmünd, Austria, and the enlargement of the wheat starch facility in Pischelsdorf will dominate our investment programme in 2018|19. We are also moving the production of organic sugar from the Czech Republic (Hrušovany) to Tulln, Austria. All told, we plan to invest over € 170 million this year, which is more than last year and significantly above the level of depreciation, thus laying the foundation for further profitable growth.
Outlook
We are optimistic for the new 2018|19 financial year now underway, especially for the Fruit segment, where we expect further volume-driven growth in sales revenue and EBIT. In the Starch segment, given the volatility of ethanol quotations and the lower isoglucose prices, no new record high is expected in earnings. As we anticipate a very difficult financial year for the Sugar segment,
the overall EBIT for the Group is predicted at well below last year’s result.
However, based on a sound balance sheet structure and well-diversified business model, and despite the short- term weakness in the sugar outlook, AGRANA considers itself to be well positioned for the future both financially and strategically and will rigorously continue to pursue its goal of long-term growth in the company’s value.
On behalf of the whole Management Board, I would like to thank our employees for their commitment and loyalty; our commercial partners, for our good business relation- ships; and our shareholders, for their confidence and trust.
Sincerely
Johann Marihart Chief Executive Officer

Supervisory Board’s report
In the 2017|18 financial year AGRANA operated in an economic environment marked by numerous challenges. Despite this, the Group delivered good earnings results.
In the 2017|18 financial year as in the prior years, the Supervisory Board actively oversaw AGRANA’s performance and exercised its responsibilities and powers under the law and the Articles of Association while observing the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. Regular key agenda items of the Supervisory Board’s deliberations were the strategic orientation and further development of the Group, the business trend in all segments and the optimisation of corporate financing. In a total of five meetings, the Supervisory Board, through the reports of the Management Board and detailed written material, informed itself about the company’s business situation and financial position and about all relevant matters concerning the business performance and excep- tional business transactions. The Management Board briefed the Supervisory Board in a timely and comprehensive manner on measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board. All members of the Supervisory Board attended at least half of its meetings. Outside the regular meetings as well, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board had numerous conversations with the Management Board and was in frequent communication with the Chief Executive Officer to discuss ongoing developments in the Group’s environment, their impact on current business results, and the risk situation.
In its meeting on 11 May 2017, the Supervisory Board dealt with the audit of the parent company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2017 and the nomination of the independent auditor for election for the 2017|18 financial year. The independent auditor attended this meeting and reported on the audit priorities and results, which also included the accounting-related elements of the internal control system. The Supervisory Board adopted the parent company financial statements and approved the consolidated financial statements. In addition, at this meeting the Supervisory Board deliberated on the medium-term investment planning and a strategic equity investment project. In the meeting the Supervisory Board also extended the term of Chief Executive Officer Johann Marihart to 28 February 2021.
In the meeting on 7 July 2017 the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the expansion of the wheat starch plant at the biorefinery in Pischelsdorf, Austria, as well as an equity investment project and the medium-term planning. The conclusion of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG on 7 July 2017 marked the end of the Supervisory Board term of Jochen Fenner, who did not stand for re-election to the Supervisory Board. In his place, Helmut Friedl was elected to
the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board sincerely thanks Jochen Fenner for his many years
of valuable service to the company. In the meeting held immediately after the 2018 AGM, the newly elected Supervisory Board constituted itself, Erwin Hameseder was re-elected as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Wolfgang Heer was re-elected as its First Vice-Chairman and Klaus Buchleitner was re-elected as its Second Vice-Chairman.
The meeting on 10 November 2017 discussed the forecast financial results for 2017|18 and covered the subjects of corporate governance and financing. As well, the Management Board tenure of Fritz Gattermayer was extended to 31 August 2022.
 
In its meeting on 22 February 2018 the Supervisory Board deliberated especially on the financial planning and the capital investment projects for the 2018|19 financial year, as well as on strategic equity investment projects. In 2017|18 the Supervisory Board again performed a check of its effectiveness, based on a self-assessment, with the aim of evaluating its organisation and procedures so as to ensure the ability to fulfil its responsibilities appropriately in the interests of the shareholders and all other stake- holders. The results of this self-assessment were discussed in detail in the February 2018 meeting.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee convened for two meetings in
the 2017|18 financial year. With the independent auditor in attendance, the Audit Committee dealt exhaustively with the 2016|17 parent company and consolidated financial statements of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG and discussed the Management Board’s proposal for the appropriation of profit. Other topics of the Committee’s deliberations were the audit of the corporate governance report, the report from Internal Audit, and the risk management system. The Audit Committee also dealt with the planning and priori- ties for the audit of the 2017|18 financial statements and discussed the subjects of anti-corruption and compliance.
The Committee chairman reported to the Supervisory Board in detail on the work of the Committee.
Parent company and consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements, group management report, parent company financial statements and parent company management report of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG (“AGRANA”) for the 2017|18 financial year presented by
the Management Board, as well as the accounting records, were audited by and received an unqualified audit opinion from KPMG Austria GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, Vienna, the independent auditor appointed by the Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board has endorsed the result of this audit.
The compliance review of the corporate governance report under section 243c Austrian Commercial Code and the review of AGRANA’s compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (the ACCG) in the 2017|18 financial year were performed by KPMG Austria GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, Vienna, and found that AGRANA complied with the provisions of the ACCG in 2017|18, inasmuch as these were within the scope of the declaration of compliance. The Supervisory Board has endorsed the result of these compliance reviews.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the parent company annual financial statements and reported to the Super- visory Board in the presence of the independent auditor. The Supervisory Board has reviewed the consolidated financial statements, group management report, parent company financial statements and parent company management report (including the corporate governance report) of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG for the 2017|18 financial year as well as the Management Board’s proposal for the appropriation of profit. The final results of all of these reviews did not give rise to any reservations.
The Supervisory Board has approved the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements for the 2017|18 financial year prepared by the Management Board, which are thus adopted for the purposes of section 96 (4) Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The Supervisory Board endorses the group management report and parent company management report for
the 2017|18 financial year and is in agreement with the proposal for the appropriation of profit.
In the name of the Supervisory Board, I would like to express my special thanks to all employees and the members of the Management Board for their commit- ment, hard work and achievements in the year.

Corporate governance report
This corporate governance report combines the corporate governance report of AGRANA Beteili- gungs-AG and the consolidated corporate governance report of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG pursuant to sections 243c and 267a Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) in conjunction with section 251 UGB.
AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG is a public limited company (a stock corporation) under Austrian law
and is listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The legal framework for corporate governance at AGRANA is provided by Austrian stock corporation law and capital market law, the regulations on employee co-determination, the Articles of Association and the terms of reference (the charters) of the Super- visory Board and Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. In addition, the Austrian Code
of Corporate Governance (ACCG), which can be found on the website of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance at www.corporate-governance.at, provides the framework for the direction and oversight of the company with the aim of ensuring a high degree of transparency for all stakeholders.
The ACCG consists of binding so-called L rules (these are based on legal requirements); of C rules (comply-or-explain rules), which are expected to be adhered to, with deviations to be explained in order to achieve compliance with the ACCG; and of R rules (recommendations), non-compliance with which requires neither disclosure nor explanation.
Commitment to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance
AGRANA is committed to the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In the 2017|18 financial year, AGRANA applied the ACCG in the version of January 2015. At its meetings on 10 Novem- ber 2017 and 22 February 2018, the Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG discussed matters of corporate governance and unanimously adopted the statement of compliance with the ACCG.
In the 2017|18 financial year the implementation of and compliance with the individual rules of the ACCG was evaluated by KPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft. The evaluation was conducted mainly on the basis of the questionnaire (January 2015 edition) issued by the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance for the purpose of assessing com- pliance with the ACCG. The report on the external evaluation in accordance with rule 62 of the ACCG is available at www.agrana.com/ir/corporate-governance.
In the 2017|18 financial year, AGRANA adhered to all C rules of the ACCG except as explained below:
█ Rule 27 (Management Board compensation criteria)
The existing employment contracts of the Management Board members do not tie variable compensation to non-financial criteria and do not specify maximum amounts. Setting ceilings on the amount of variable compensation would reduce the flexibility to respond to unforeseeable developments and to honour special achievements. A retroactive change to existing contracts does not appear justified.
█ Rule 27a (severance pay)
In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, severance pay has been agreed in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act. The Management Board contracts do not contain a ceiling on severance pay.
The approach in respect of rules 27 and 27a was adopted by the Supervisory Board and imple- mented by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in the contracts of the Management Board members.

█ Rule 49 (contracts requiring approval)
Under section 95 (5)(12) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the approval of the Supervisory Board is required for contracts with members of the Supervisory Board by which members undertake, outside their role on the Supervisory Board, to provide a service to the Company or a subsidiary for a material consideration. This also applies to contracts with companies in which a Supervisory Board member has a significant economic interest. For business policy and compe- tition reasons, the object and terms of such contracts are not published in the Annual Report
as stipulated in rule 49. This divergence was adopted by the Supervisory Board at the time of the initial commitment to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in 2005.
The business culture of the AGRANA Group has always been marked by open and constructive teamwork between the Management Board and Supervisory Board, which together ensure that the ACCG’s requirements are fulfilled. The Management and Supervisory Boards of AGRANA, and especially their chairmen, are thus engaged in ongoing dialogue regarding the Group’s performance and strategic direction, both at and between the meetings of the Supervisory Board.
To safeguard open and transparent communication with all capital market participants and the inter- ested public, information provided to investors during conference calls and road shows is simultane- ously made available to all other shareholders via the Group website at www.agrana.com/en/ir.

The Supervisory Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG applies the guidelines for the definition of super- visory board independence as set out in Annex 1 to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance:
█ A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past five years, have been a member of the Management Board or other management staff of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.
█ A Supervisory Board member shall not have a business relationship of a size significant to him or her with the company or a subsidiary of the company, and shall not have had such a business relationship in the past year. This also applies to business relationships with companies in
which the Supervisory Board member holds a significant economic interest, but does not apply to board positions held within the Group.
█ The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board under L rule 48 does not automatically imply a member’s designation as non-independent.
█ A Supervisory Board member shall not, in the past three years, have been an external auditor of the Company or a partner or employee of the external audit firm.
█ A Supervisory Board member shall not be a management board member of another company in which a member of the Company’s Management Board is a supervisory board member.
█ A Supervisory Board member shall not serve on the Supervisory Board for more than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a strategic share- holding in the Company or who represent the interests of such a shareholder.
█ A Supervisory Board member shall not be a close relative (direct descendant, spouse, common-law spouse, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, nephew or niece) of a Management Board member or of persons holding any of the positions referred to in the foregoing points.

Committees and their members
Where the importance or specialist nature of a particular subject matter makes it appropriate, the Supervisory Board also exercises its advisory and supervisory functions through the following three committees:
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee deals with the legal relationships between the Company and the members of the Management Board. The Committee is responsible for succession planning in respect of the Management Board and approves the compensation schemes for the Management Board members. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee held two meetings
in the 2017|18 financial year. These dealt especially with the subjects of succession planning and the renewal of expiring Management Board terms. The Strategy Committee prepares strategic decisions of the Supervisory Board by providing decision support, and makes decisions in urgent matters. The Strategy Committee held no meetings in the 2017|18 financial year. The Audit Committee prepares
for transaction by the Supervisory Board all matters related to the Company’s separate financial statements and to the auditing of the accounting records and of the consolidated financial statements and Group management report, including the corporate governance report. It monitors the effective- ness of the internal control system and risk management system and of the Internal Audit function, and verifies the independence and qualifications of the external auditors. In the 2017|18 financial year the Audit Committee met twice. Its meetings focused particularly on the audit of the 2016|17 financial statements, the preparation of the audit of the 2017|18 financial statements, and the supervision
of the risk management system. The Audit Committee also dealt with the compliance report and the report of the Group’s Internal Audit function.
The Supervisory Board terms of reference include the procedures for the committees; an excerpt of the terms of reference is available on the AGRANA website at www.agrana.com/en/investor/ corporate-governance.
Supervisory Board committees consist of the Supervisory Board Chairman or a Vice-Chairman,
and of as many other members as the Supervisory Board shall determine. The only exception is the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which consists of the Supervisory Board Chairman and two members appointed from among the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting. If the Supervisory Board has two Vice-Chairmen, they shall be appointed as these two other members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

         Post-employment benefits granted to the Management Board under the Company’s plan are pension, disability insurance and survivor benefits. For the Management Board members Johann Marihart and Fritz Gattermayer, the following applies: The pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the Austrian public pension scheme under the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG4) are met. In the event of retirement before the age determined under the ASVG, the amount of the pension is reduced. The pension amount is calculated as a percentage of a contractually agreed assess- ment base. For the pension of Stephan Büttner, there is a defined contribution obligation, which can be claimed after the recipient has reached 55 years of age provided that the employment relationship has been terminated. For the 2017|18 financial year, pension fund contributions of € 352 thousand were paid (prior year: € 354 thousand). A follow-up payment of € 109 thousand was made to former Chief Financial Officer Walter Grausam, who retired on 31 December 2014.
The retirement benefit obligations in respect of the Management Board are administered by an external pension fund. In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, there are severance pay obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act (see note on rule 27a) or the Occupational Pension Plan Act (BMSVG5). In the balance sheet at 28 February 2018,
within the item “retirement and termination benefit obligations”, an amount of € 6,874 thousand was recognised for pension obligations (prior year: € 8,496 thousand) and an amount of € 2,283 thousand was recognised for termination benefit obligations (prior year: € 2,151 thousand).
No compensation agreements in the event of a public tender offer exist between the Company and its Management Board, Supervisory Board or other staff.

         In accordance with section 110 (3) of the Austrian Labour Act, those Supervisory Board members who are employee representatives do not receive Supervisory Board compensation.
Compliance
For AGRANA, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is integral to good corporate governance.
AGRANA has a dedicated Compliance Office led by the Director of Corporate Compliance, who reports directly to the Management Board member responsible and centrally looks after the compliance activities. Additionally, the CFOs of the segments and subsidiaries act as compliance officers in order to implement relevant Group requirements efficiently. The most important responsibilities of the Compliance Office include the implementation and expansion of the compliance management system in the AGRANA Group, with the aim of fulfilling the organisational and supervisory obligations of the Group’s management under the law. Key functions of the Compliance Office are the production and training of internal guidelines, provision of support in compliance matters, documentation of cases of non-compliance, and issuing of recommendations. In addition to the Compliance Office there
is a Compliance Board, which deliberates on an ongoing basis on fundamental questions in matters of compliance.

 AGRANA’s compliance management system comprises the following core elements and policies:
The AGRANA Code of Conduct forms the foundation of all business actions and decisions. The Code of Conduct is designed to give a clear and systematic understanding of the conduct which AGRANA expects from all employees, managers and directors in all activities and locations of the Group. Together with the mission statement, it guides the entire AGRANA Group, setting unambiguous standards of integrity, correct business conduct and ethical principles.
In addition to the rules on conflicts of interest set out in the Code of Conduct, AGRANA has a separate Conflict-of-Interest Policy. In the course of business activities, it is possible that the personal or financial interests of staff or board members come, or could come, into conflict with the interests of the AGRANA Group. A reporting and documentation system has been developed for this that applies for all AGRANA employees and board members.
Anticorruption laws apply worldwide and must be obeyed everywhere and at all times. In view
of Austria’s specific anti-corruption legislation, AGRANA has a separate Austria Anti-Corruption Policy, which complements the Code of Conduct. This policy sets out binding regulations and a reporting system. The policy is intended to mitigate the potential risk of violations of the law and of
the AGRANA Code of Conduct as well as to facilitate the proper handling of invitations and gifts.
AGRANA also has a Tax Policy, applicable in Austria, that governs the handling of sponsorships, donations and benefits in kind.
The purpose of the globally applicable Antitrust Compliance Policy is to ensure that all employees and board members know and abide by the essential provisions of competition and antitrust law and have the awareness to recognise situations with antitrust relevance. The overarching aim of this policy is to preserve employees from violating antitrust legislation and to provide practical, real-world support in applying the relevant rules.
The Policy on Information-Sharing in Joint Ventures was created to complement the applicable Anti- trust Compliance Policy and prescribes what information may be shared with joint venture partners.
As a publicly traded company, AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has issued a Capital Market Compliance Policy to ensure adherence to stock exchange and capital market laws and regulations. It sets out the principles governing the disclosure of information and prescribes organisational measures such as for safeguarding confidentiality and preventing improper use or transmission of insider information.
In the 2017|18 financial year the electronic training tool that has been in place since 2016|17 at the sites in Austria was rolled out to all locations worldwide. The AGRANA compliance e-learning covers all key topics relevant to compliance and must be re-taken annually. In the year under review it was completed by 2,951 (or 98.4%) of the 3,000 identified employees and board members (all salaried employees were identified). All members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board received the training.
The Internal Audit department verifies compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies. In the 2017|18 financial year it audited 16 of the 52 production sites/companies, i.e., 30% of sites/companies within the GRI reporting boundaries (see the section “Non-financial information statement under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code”, page 43), including audits for corruption and fraud in selected subject areas. No significant breaches of legal norms regarding anti-corruption were found. At one site, it was determined that an employee violated the obligation under the AGRANA Code of Conduct to report potential conflicts of interest. Although it could not be proved that the employee took advantage of the situation, this non-adherence to an internal AGRANA policy led to the mutually agreed departure of the employee.

 Corporate governance report
 Diversity strategy for the Management Board and Supervisory Board
New or vacant positions on the Management Board of AGRANA-Beteiligungs-AG are filled through structured processes supported by a recruitment consultant, with the aim of finding the most suitable candidate for the position, ideally from within AGRANA. In this search, women are neither discrimi- nated against nor given preference. The ultimate hiring decision is made by the Supervisory Board.
Under the Gender Equality on Supervisory Boards Act (also known in German as the GFMA-G), section 86 (7) Austrian Stock Corporation Act applies to elections and appointments to supervisory boards that occur after 31 December 2017, i.e., a ratio of at least 30% women must be achieved for all supervisory board members elected or appointed from 1 January 2018, failing which the non-compli- ant election or appointment would be invalid. The tenure of existing supervisory board members
is not affected. At the 2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM) of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG, all members of the Supervisory Board were elected for a term ending at the conclusion of the General Meeting that decides on board members’ discharge from liability for the 2021|22 financial year. As a result, the quota requirement does not enter into operation until any vacant positions are to be filled or, at the latest, at the elections to the Supervisory Board in the 2022 calendar year.
Promoting equity for women
For more and more people, the ability to balance work and family life ranks high on the list of expectations for the workplace and is a major element of job satisfaction. For women, it is frequently a critical career factor.
To provide the best possible conditions for achieving a balance between work and family responsi- bilities for the greatest possible number of employees, AGRANA offers flexible working hours and a Group-wide framework agreement for teleworking. As well, a company day-care centre is avail-
able at the headquarters in Vienna. Additionally, AGRANA provides financial assistance for the care of young children up to three years old in Austria and Germany. AGRANA also organises and majority-funds a summer holiday child care service at a production site in Austria, and makes avail- able a parent-child office at the Vienna headquarters where parents can, for example, supervise their children’s homework in the afternoon.

AGRANA’s strategy

A long-term, globally oriented partnership with shareholders
Fruit
Synergies
Exploit cross-segment synergies to gain an ideal positioning for the ever more volatile environment in
the business segments
As an Austrian industrial group with an international focus, AGRANA’s Sugar and Starch segments operate mainly in Europe and the operations of its Fruit segment are global. In these markets, AGRANA seeks or already commands a leading position in the industrial processing of agricultural raw materials. The Group pursues a growth strategy oriented to the respective local market opportunities. Long-lasting, stable customer and supplier relationships, respectful treatment of all stakeholders and continual growth in the company’s value are major cornerstones of the corporate strategy, which
is guided by the principles of sustainable management. AGRANA’s aim is to provide both its globally operating and its regional customers worldwide with high product quality, optimum service and innovative product development ideas and expertise.
AGRANA controls and manages the product value chain from the purchase of agricultural raw materials to the production of the resulting intermediate goods for industrial customers (and end products for consumers in the case of the Sugar segment). The Group utilises its strategic know-how across segment boundaries. This is especially true for agricultural grower contract management and
raw material procurement, the knowledge of customer requirements and markets, the opportunities for the development of inter-segment products, and synergies in logistics, purchasing, sales and finance. The cross-segment application of these competencies forms the basis for a robust market position relative to competitors in all product groups, and underpins AGRANA’s innovative strength and lean cost position.
In its business operations, AGRANA seeks to make the part of the value chain that it can influence as sustainable as possible. By sustainability in this context AGRANA primarily means the following three aspects, which apply to all business segments:
 █
█ █
Utilisation of almost 100% of the agricultural raw materials employed, and use of low-emission technologies to minimise impacts on the environment
Respect for all stakeholders and communities where the Group operates
Working together in long-term partnerships
Sugar
Strategic goal:
Customer- and market- oriented growth in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe
      32
Strategic goal:
Customer- and market-oriented global growth
Starch
Strategic goals:
Organic (non-acquisitive) growth and the creation of value-added in custom-made products

Sugar segment strategy
Strategic goal: Customer- and market-oriented growth.
In the Sugar segment, AGRANA is very well positioned as
a supplier in the Central, Eastern and Southeastern Euro- pean countries. AGRANA differentiates itself from the com- petition through high quality standards, market service,
an extensive sugar product portfolio, and by building the Group’s regional brands. In addition to the goal of posi- tioning sugar as a regional brand-name product, AGRANA continues to strive for full capacity utilisation everywhere (including yield improvement) and an intensification of marketing activities in Southeastern Europe. The Group’s own production of beet sugar is supplemented by the re- selling and refining activities of AGRANA’s Sugar segment, especially in the Southeastern European countries with beet sugar deficits.
Starch segment strategy
The strategic goals: Organic (non-acquisitive) growth and the creation of value-added in custom-made products. In the Starch segment, AGRANA focuses on highly refined specialty products. Innovative, customer-driven products supported by application advice and continuous product development, combined with cost optimisation, are
the key to the segment’s success. An example is the leading position in organic starches and GMO-free1 starches
for the food industry. As well, in the non-food sector, the Group is a leading supplier of specialty starches for the paper, textile, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and building materials industries.
AGRANA’s essential core competency – the large-scale processing of agricultural raw materials into industrial products – is also the basis for the bioethanol
business. In Austria, AGRANA is the leading vendor of this climate-friendly fuel thanks to the bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria. In bioethanol production, AGRANA effectively applies its principle of completely utilising the agricultural raw materials employed, thus enhanc- ing value-added through the optimal use of all residual components of raw materials in by-products.
Fruit segment strategy
Strategic goal: Customer- and market-oriented global growth. In the Fruit segment, the Group’s business a ctivities are fruit preparations (AGRANA Fruit, about 80% of the segment’s revenue) and fruit juice concentrates (AUSTRIA JUICE, about 20% of segment revenue):
█ AGRANA Fruit produces custom fruit preparations for the dairy, ice cream, baking and food service industries. With local production units in close proximity to customers, AGRANA is the world leader in this global market and intends to further expand its presence, follow its internationally operating customers into new markets and grow faster than the market.
█ AUSTRIA JUICE is a producer and reseller mainly of juice concentrates from apples, red fruits and berries. High quality is assured through manufacturing sites close to the crop-growing areas and by modern production facilities and frequent quality checks. The aim is to increase global sales into the beverage indus- try, including also the further expansion in not-from- concentrate juices and fruit wines as well as in aromas and beverage bases.
AGRANA wants to consolidate and strengthen its global market position through organic growth and with the help of acquisitions and cooperative new ventures.
Synergy strategy
Strategic goal: Raise inter-segment synergies to ensure the Group’s optimum positioning amid a volatile operat- ing environment in the business segments. The synergy strategy encompasses the strategies of the three individual segments and also includes the sustainability dimension. Specifically, AGRANA seeks to exploit synergies between the three business segments in raw material procurement, in production and in marketing. This collaboration across its businesses helps AGRANA to supply a broad portfolio
of high-quality products for a wide range of applications, both in the food and non-food sectors.
Capital market strategy
Strategic goal: A long-term partnership with share- holders. The Group’s sound equity base gives AGRANA strategic flexibility. For its overall financing needs, AGRANA not only has the ability to self-finance but can draw on committed credit lines and the proceeds of a Schuldscheindarlehen (a loan with bond-like charac- teristics, sometimes translated as “bonded loan” or
“promissory note loan”). AGRANA sees its shareholders as long-term partners in realising the Group’s goals and offers them an attractive long-run return on investment at a reasonable level of risk. With a policy of open and transparent communication, AGRANA aims to safeguard investors’ confidence in the Group and make its business performance and its management decisions predictable and easy to understand.

AGRANA share performance and stock market environment
In the equity market, the 2017 calendar year was dominated by an unusually steady rising trend
in share prices. The price gains are well supported by fundamentals, as corporate earnings worldwide expanded significantly, buoyed by the strong growth of the global economy and world trade. Upbeat economic forecasts and a continuing easy interest rate environment allowed market sentiment to soar and took indexes for many markets to historic highs. With an advance of 30.6% over the year, Austria’s benchmark ATX index ranked as one of the world’s best-performing stock market bellwethers. The high for the year was reached on 2 November 2017 (at 3,445.23 points); after a sideways move- ment in the last two months of 2017, the ATX ended the calendar year at 3,420.14 points.
On 1 March 2017, AGRANA started the 2017|18 financial year at a share price of € 106.00. In the already described positive setting for stock markets around the world and in Vienna, AGRANA shares rose after good annual results and a guidance increase in June (for a higher EBIT projection), achieving
a high for the year in the first half of the financial year (11 July 2017: € 115.80). In the second half
of the year the environment for sugar producers progressively deteriorated, which made itself felt in AGRANA’s share price. The closing price of € 99.10 at the balance sheet date represented a decrease of 6.5% from the opening price at the start of the financial year. The performance of the ATX index over the same period was significantly positive (up 26.6%). AGRANA’s average trading volume on the Vienna Stock Exchange rose significantly as a result of the February 2017 capital increase, to about 19,300 shares per day (prior year: approximately 6,400 shares per day2).

The market capitalisation at 28 February 2018, with 15,622,244 shares outstanding, was € 1,548.2 million (prior year: € 1,656.0 million).
AGRANA is listed in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and is also quoted in the VÖNIX, the Austrian Sustainability Index. This equity index com- prises those exchange-traded Austrian companies which are leading in social and environmental performance. Between 18 September 2017 and 19 March 2018, after an eleven-year absence, AGRANA was also a component
of the ATX again, thus forming part of the price index that consists of the approximately twenty most liquid shares on the Vienna Stock Exchange.
Active capital market communication
AGRANA’s investor relations activities are based on
the key principles of providing comprehensive and timely information, transparency and ongoing communication with investors and analysts. At the press conferences presenting the annual and half-year results, the Manage- ment Board thoroughly briefed the financial and industry media on the financial and business performance.
In addition, in press releases and one-on-one interviews with financial, agricultural and other trade journalists, AGRANA provided information on subjects of current relevance to its business activities. Media representatives were also invited on tours of operational sites.
At several road shows and investor conferences in Austria and abroad, the Management Board provided Austrian and international institutional investors and analysts with information on the performance and prospects of the AGRANA Group. This was supplemented by numerous individual conversations as well as by conference calls accompanying the publication of the quarterly and full- year results. Retail shareholders were invited on a tour of the biorefinery in Pischelsdorf, Austria, and also had
the opportunity at the GEWINN trade fair in Vienna to hear directly from the Management Board about current projects and the business operations. AGRANA encourages young people’s interest in the capital market; in 2017|18 the Group invited students to tour the corn starch plant in Aschach, Austria, as part of an Austria-wide stock market
investment game, and also supported the “Research Challenge” project of the CFA Institute in Austria.
An additional important channel of investor relations activities is the AGRANA website (www.agrana.com/en/ir), where all financial reports, financial news items, insider information announcements, voting rights notifications, management transaction disclosures and investor presentations are available as soon as they are published. AGRANA endeavours to make the same information available to all market participants at the same time.
In the 2017|18 financial year, Berenberg Bank, Erste
Bank Group, Goldman Sachs and Raiffeisen Centrobank published research reports on AGRANA. At the balance sheet date of 28 February 2018, the investment houses had two neutral ratings, one accumulate and one buy rating on AGRANA. A detailed overview of the research reports can be found on the Internet at www.agrana.com/ en/investor/agrana-shares (heading: Research).

 Organisational structure
 AGRANA is a globally operating processor of agricultural raw materials, with its Sugar, Starch and Fruit segments manufacturing high-quality foods and many intermediate products for the downstream food industry as well as for non-food applications. With about 8,700 employees (in FTE1) at 57 produc- tion sites on six continents, the Group generated revenue of approximately € 2.6 billion in the 2017|18 financial year. AGRANA was established in 1988 and has been quoted on the Vienna Stock Exchange since 1991.
Sugar segment Starch segment Fruit segment
Business segments and procurement models
In the Sugar segment, AGRANA processes sugar beet from contract growers and also refines raw sugar purchased worldwide. The products are sold into downstream industries for use in, for example, sweets, non-alcoholic beverages and pharmaceutical applications. Under country-specific sugar consumer brands, AGRANA also markets a wide range of sugars and sugar specialty products to con- sumers through food retailers. In addition, in the interest of the most complete possible utilisation of its agricultural raw materials, AGRANA produces a large number of fertilisers and animal feed- stuffs. These not only help the economic bottom line but also ecologically close the material cycle by returning minerals and other nutrients to the land and the food chain.
In the Starch segment, AGRANA processes and refines raw materials grown by contract farmers
or purchased in the open market – mainly corn (maize), wheat and potatoes – into premium starch products. These products are sold both into the food and beverage industry and the paper, textile, cosmetics and building materials sectors and other non-food industries. The starch operations as well produce fertilisers and high-quality animal feeds. The production of climate-friendly bioethanol for blending with petrol is also part of the Starch segment’s activities.
The Fruit segment custom-designs and produces fruit preparations (fruit ingredients) and fruit juice concentrates. AGRANA is the world’s leading manufacturer of fruit preparations for the dairy, bakery, ice cream and food service industries. The fruit used in the fruit preparations is sourced largely from primary processors, in frozen or aseptic form. In some countries, AGRANA operates its own primary processing plants where fresh fruit (in some cases from contract growers) is received and readied for processing into fruit preparations. In the fruit juice concentrate business, at production sites located mainly in Europe, AGRANA produces apple and berry juice concentrates, not-from-concentrate juices, fruit wines, beverage bases and aromas. In the Fruit segment too, AGRANA seeks to achieve the most sustainable and complete utilisation of raw materials possible. While fruit preparations production generates very little usable residue, the press cake from apple juice production, known as apple pomace, is utilised by the pectin industry and as a feedstuff.

In line with its business activities and its sustainability priorities in the areas of energy efficiency, complete raw material utilisation, attention to environmental and social criteria in procurement, and business ethics, AGRANA supports especially the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8, 13, 15 and 16 adopted in September 2015 by the General Assembly of the United Nations. For the first time these goals also engage the private sector in further- ing the achievement of development goals. In addition, AGRANA contributes to the attainment of Goals 2 to 7, 12, 14 and 17.
Group management report

 Non-financial information statement
under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code1
AGRANA reports non-financial sustainability matters (i.e., topics)2 that are material to its business activities3 by integrating them in the Group management report, with the relevant pages visually marked by a green fingerprint. This non-financial information statement provides an overview of AGRANA’s understanding of sustainability, the AGRANA materiality matrix, management approaches for the key non-financial matters/topics, and the organisational and content boundaries of the sustainability reporting. Management measures taken, performance indicators as well as goals in the individual areas are presented in the business segment reports, the section “AGRANA’s people” and the corporate governance report.
AGRANA’s understanding of sustainability
AGRANA as an industrial processor of agricultural raw materials defines sustainability in its business activities as a harmonious balance of economic, environmental and social responsibility. This under- standing of sustainability is summed up by three sustainability principles, which serve management and all employees as a practical and intuitive guide to daily sustainable action:
At AGRANA we:
█ Utilise almost 100% of our agricultural raw materials and use low-emission technologies
to minimise impacts on the environment
█ Respect all our stakeholders and the communities where we operate
█ Engage in long-term partnerships with suppliers and customers
AGRANA has developed its understanding of sustainability through regular interactions with its stakeholders:
      Service providers, contractors
Industrial customers
Neighbours, local com- munities

     1 This non-financial information statement by AGRANA under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code is based on the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and has been prepared in accordance with GRI Standards: Core option.
2 Terminology note: In this report, in the context of non-financial and sustainability reporting, the words “matters”, “topics”
and “aspects” all mean the subjects of such reporting and are used synonymously. The background is that the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act and the EU Non-financial Reporting Directive refer to non-financial information subjects as “matters”, while the GRI Standards now refer to sustainability subjects as “topics”, replacing the old term “Aspects” used under the GRI G4 Reporting Guidelines.

Material non-financial matters and sustainability topics
In the 2017|18 financial year, AGRANA’s Sugar, Starch and Fruit segments processed a world- wide total of approximately 9.7 million tonnes of agricultural raw materials (prior year: 10.6 million tonnes) and sold 5.8 million tonnes of high-quality products (prior year: 5.9 million tonnes).
Based on its business activities, AGRANA in 2012|13 identified six issues of interest along its product value chain:
1. Environmental and social criteria (i.e., labour practices and human rights)
in the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products
2. Environmental and energy topics in AGRANA’s production operations
3. Working conditions and human rights in respect of AGRANA employees
4. Product responsibility and sustainable products
5. Compliance and business conduct
6. Social engagement and stakeholder inclusiveness
As part of a revision of the materiality analysis in the 2017|18 financial year, the AGRANA sustain- ability core team assessed the environmental, economic and social impacts of individual sus- tainability aspects of AGRANA’s business activities. The AGRANA Group’s most significant impacts overall arise in the area of environmental and energy topics, as a result of its value-added pro- cessing of agricultural raw materials, which is energy-intensive especially in the Sugar and Starch segments. However, within the Fruit segment, due to the global scale of its raw material sourcing, the highest impacts are those of the supplier operations from which AGRANA procures its fruit.
In order to evaluate the significance of the cited sustainability topics for the assessment of the Group by external and internal stakeholders, AGRANA commissioned a survey of representative stakeholders1, using a structured questionnaire. For the stakeholders the issues of product
safety, compliance with legal requirements, workplace safety, and energy consumption and emissions were, on average, the highest priority across all business segments. Only stakeholders of the globally operating Fruit segment saw the topic of environmental and social criteria in pro- curement as being more significant. They expect AGRANA to implement uniformly high standards both in its own product value chain and its supply chain. This applies particularly to suppliers’ use of sustainable agriculture practices that employ energy and water efficiently and to suppliers’ compliance with the social criteria of the AGRANA Code of Conduct. The stakeholders surveyed regarded the issue of “social engagement and stakeholder inclusion” as having very little significance. In the future it will therefore no longer be considered a material topic, but will continue to be reported on a voluntary basis.
This report covers all topics under which AGRANA has material impacts or that have high significance for AGRANA’s stakeholders (see GRI content index from page 179).

The organisational boundaries for the reporting of the non-financial (i.e., sustainability) infor- mation integrated in this 2017|18 annual report encompass all AGRANA Group companies world- wide and match the set of companies included in the Group’s financial consolidation, with the exception of the new AGRANA company for fruit preparations in India, which was only consoli- dated for the first time towards the end of the 2016|17 financial year and only began production towards the end of 2017|18.
For organisational boundary reasons, the non-financial (i.e., sustainability) data continue to exclude the equity-accounted joint ventures of the AGRANA Group – the AGRANA-STUDEN group (in the Sugar segment) and the HUNGRANA group (in the Starch segment).
AGRANA’s business activities are divided into three business segments. The reporting of non-finan- cial information and GRI indicators follows this structure, as the differences in business processes between these segments could reduce or distort the significance of data consolidated at Group level (for example, data on energy consumption and emissions).
   1 Representatives of the following stakeholder groups: customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders and local communities. 43

 Management approaches for
material non-financial matters/topics, and resulting content boundaries
For ease of understanding of the reporting scope and the underlying management approaches, a more detailed demarcation in terms of content is necessary for the following matters/topics of particular relevance to AGRANA’s stakeholders.
Supply chain matters/topics
Environmental and social criteria in the procurement
of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products In view of its core business of processing agricultural
raw materials and of the associated very significant procurement volumes and costs, as well as the potential for negative environmental and social impacts of crop production, AGRANA concentrates its sustainability work in the supply chain on suppliers of agricultural raw materials and intermediate goods (such as frozen fruit pieces) and limits its non-financial reporting scope to this area of procurement. In accordance with the precau- tionary principle, AGRANA seeks to avoid or minimise environmental risks from the growing of raw materials (such as detrimental effects on soil health and retention, water availability and quality, and biodiversity) and social risks (such as negative impacts on working conditions and human rights, and particularly the risk of child labour) by promoting good agricultural practices and compliance with social standards, such as the standards of the International Labour Organization, in its supply chain. Although AGRANA has no direct control over its suppliers’ practices, its procurement contributes to the potential for the impacts described and the Group’s business relationships thus indirectly link it to effects in the supply chain. AGRANA has set out its requirements for agri- cultural suppliers in its principles for the procurement
of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products, a document which, for the social criteria, refers to
and thus incorporates AGRANA’s Code of Conduct. The principles for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products are incorporated
in supply contracts.
Documentation in connection with
the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI)
In order to work on and document sustainability topics
in the agricultural supply chain in a structured way regard- less of the procurement model, AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has since July 2014 been an active member of the Sustain- able Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI, a food industry initiative founded in 2002), and, with its Sugar, Starch
and Fruit segments, participates in all working groups and committees relevant to its raw materials.
The SAI gives processors of agricultural raw materials like AGRANA several helpful tools particularly for the evaluation and documentation of conformity with good environmental and social practices in the agricultural supply chain and for comparing the value of different documentation types and international certifications.
The underlying tool is always the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) created by the SAI. This assessment is carried out using a 112-point questionnaire covering
all features relevant to sustainability, such as farm management, working conditions (including questions on child and forced labour), soil and nutrient manage- ment and crop protection. Depending on the fulfilment of the various criteria, each farm receives a sustain- ability rating designated by a status of “gold”, “silver”,
“bronze”, or “not yet bronze”.
For procurement sectors without direct access to the agricultural producers of the raw materials, the SAI makes available a very comprehensive benchmarking of the FSA requirements against the national legislation of many countries, against relevant international certification standards (such as Global GAP, Rainforest Alliance, Bonsucro, etc.), and even against some company-specific sustainability programmes. The verified compliance
with national legal requirements or the certification to certain international or company standards, as well as the external verification of farm self-assessments under the FSA in conformity with the rules of the SAI Implemen- tation Framework, enable agricultural producers and the processing industry to advertise their SAI sustainability status.
Details on the activities for the implementation of AGRANA’s principles for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products and regarding the SAI sustainability status in the Sugar, Starch and Fruit segments are presented in the respective segment reports (see pages 61, 68 and 74ff.).
Building awareness of good agricultural practice – BETAEXPO
Awareness-building and ongoing training are basic building blocks of AGRANA’s collaboration with its approximately 9,700 contract growers. Besides many training measures in all segments, AGRANA therefore twice annually holds BETAEXPO, featuring Austria’s largest field of demonstra- tion plantings of AGRANA raw material crops. The June 2017 BETAEXPO field symposium on crop protection, which reflected the political debate over the use of specific groups of crop protection agents, attracted about 2,000 visitors to the event site on the grounds of the AGRANA sugar factory in Tulln, Austria. Next to the panel discussion

 on crop protection, the BETAEXPO symposium offered plenty of information for forward-thinking farmers
and anyone interested in agriculture, on the subjects of crop breeding, crop protection, fertilising and machinery. A lecture series presented by experts showcased modern agriculture, rounded out with equipment demonstra- tions by well-known manufacturers.
In the run-up to BETAEXPO in June 2017, AGRANA publicly recognised outstanding raw material suppliers with the AGRANA Sustainability Award 2017 for especially sustain- able farming operations in the categories of sugar
beet, potato, corn (maize) and, for the first time, inter- nationally in the categories of fruit and juice.
The BETAEXPO family day in September 2017 was attended by more than 4,000 farmers and visitors with an inter- est in agriculture or in Tulln as an industry location.
In live demonstrations of farm equipment, they were able to learn about the latest agricultural insights and receive practical tips on harvest technology from experts, gain an inside view of sugar production at the open house
of the Tulln sugar plant and thus follow the process from beet processing and sugar crystallisation all the way to the finished product, “Wiener Zucker”.
Biodiversity
Biodiversity is important to AGRANA especially in its upstream value chain, i.e., in the farming landscape. In this annual report, to the extent possible, biodiversity aspects of raw material procurement from contract grow- ers are published in the respective business segment’s section of the report. Additionally, once a year AGRANA evaluates the biodiversity or conservation value of the local ecosystem at its own production sites, based on local legal requirements and criteria of different conservation groups. Although none of the production sites within
the GRI reporting boundaries (see page 43) are located in a nature reserve or area with high biodiversity value, AGRANA also carries out some projects at its business loca- tions to protect or increase species diversity. Thus, since the previous year, AGRANA maintains a bee conservation project, which involved installing bee hives at all Austrian locations of the Group. For further projects, see pages 64, 71 and 78.
Water in the upstream value chain
Due to limited data availability and reliability, data on water use in the upstream value chain (i.e., in the production of agricultural raw materials) do not exist for all raw materials used worldwide and are therefore not reported.
Environmental and energy topics
in AGRANA’s production operations
The basis for AGRANA’s management of environmental and energy matters is its environmental policy, which follows the precautionary approach and underpins the avoidance or reduction of negative economic, environ- mental and social impacts of AGRANA’s production activities. The environmental policy also provides a griev- ance mechanism.
Energy consumption and emissions
The processing of agricultural raw materials, which
is especially energy-intensive in the Sugar and Starch segments, entails economic risks for AGRANA, such
as potential scenarios like the prohibition of some or
all fossil fuels by law, the loss of operating licences, and a lack of affordable renewable sources of energy. It also holds environmental and social risks through green- house gases emitted during production and their impacts, such as health hazards or commodity scarcity as a result of increasing extreme weather conditions, i.e., of climate change. These potential impacts are within AGRANA’s direct control. AGRANA is committed to operating respon- sibly and strives to minimise or progressively further reduce actual negative impacts to the extent possible.
In keeping with its environmental policy, AGRANA’s
goal is therefore to use low-emission sources of energy at all of its production sites, and to use them as effi- ciently as possible. To achieve this, AGRANA began in 2014 to introduce energy management systems. The energy management systems of 50% of all AGRANA production sites within the GRI reporting boundaries (see page 43) are certified to ISO 50001.
All AGRANA segments have energy targets, relevant to their business activity, with a current target period
up to and including the 2020|21 financial year. The prog- ress towards goals to date is presented in the respective segment reports (see pages 62f., 69 and 76f.).
AGRANA’s reporting of energy consumption and emissions is confined to specific values per tonne of product out- put (core products and by-products) in its own production operations, and is limited to Scope 1 (direct energy consumption and emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect energy consumption and emissions).
Since as long ago as 2008, AGRANA calculates carbon footprints for a representative selection of its products. However, as the EU to date does not have a binding norm for the methodology for calculating the CO2 footprint
of foods and food ingredients such as sugar, starch, fruit preparations and fruit juice concentrates, AGRANA elects
Non-financial information statement
  45

 not to publish results. For example, the carbon foot- print of sugar can vary by plus or minus 50% depending on the calculation method. Nonetheless, the European Association of Sugar Manufacturers (CEFS), based on its calculations, cites a footprint range of 242 to 771 grammes of CO2 equivalent per kilogramme of beet sugar.
For the carbon footprint of bioethanol, however, the application of the EU energy allocation method is manda- tory in documenting the energy consumption reductions from biogenic fuels targeted under the EU Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC), which supports the use of energy from renewable resources. The carbon footprint
of bioethanol is therefore reported (on AGRANA’s website).
Water and effluent (wastewater)
Water, the most important resource globally for the world’s population, is one of many inputs in the produc- tion processes of the AGRANA Group. General water scarcity and the withdrawal of water in water-stressed regions, as well as poor water quality and too high
a temperature of discharged wastewater, are frequently a significant economic, environmental and social risk. Although scarcity of good-quality water is not an issue at AGRANA’s production sites, the sustainable, responsible use and discharge of water, in compliance with all legal standards, is a major aspect of the AGRANA environ- mental policy. In its quest for efficiency, AGRANA utilises the water contained in the agricultural raw materials
for its processes.
AGRANA reports water and wastewater figures solely for its principal business, the processing of agricultural
raw materials in its production plants, on a specific basis per tonne of product (core and by-products), as absolute values do not provide a meaningful indication of water use efficiency, owing to the fact that processing volumes fluctuate from year to year. Some AGRANA segments have water-related targets, relevant to their business activity, for the target period up to and including the 2020|21 finan- cial year. The progress towards goals to date is presented
in the respective segment reports (see pages 61 and 63, 70, 74 and 77).
Waste
The economic, environmental and social risks, and impacts, of waste generation and disposal in AGRANA’s business activities are limited thanks to the Group’s policy and practice of minimising waste through the virtually complete utilisation of raw materials. For AGRANA as an agricultural processor, its raw materials are far too valuable not to be utilised to the fullest. The Group-wide principle
of complete utilisation is entrenched in the environmental
policy and is practiced by producing both a wide range of high-quality foods and intermediate products for down- stream industries and – particularly in the Sugar and Starch segments – manufacturing a very broad portfolio of by-products, especially feedstuffs and fertilisers. These not only contribute significantly to the economic bottom line but also close nature’s material cycle by returning minerals and other nutrients to the land and the food chain.
In some countries, the by-product feeds and fertilisers marketed (or in some cases given away free) by
AGRANA must be declared as waste for regulatory report- ing purposes, solely to comply with the local regulatory regimes. Since the 2015|16 financial year, AGRANA no longer reports these as waste in the annual report,
as they are directly used as valuable feedstuffs in animal husbandry or as fertilisers in crop cultivation.
Measured against total product output, hazardous waste
in 2017|18 only amounted to 0.01%, or about 100 grammes per tonne of product (core and by-products). In accor- dance with legal requirements, this material was collected and transferred to qualified waste disposal providers for appropriate treatment.
Transport
Although the transport of raw materials and products only represents a comparatively low share of mostly less than 10% of the carbon footprint of AGRANA products (depending on the calculation method and country), the Group strives to make transport activities as sustainable as infrastructure and economics will allow.
Thus, the long-term modal split for inbound and outbound logistics in the AGRANA Group, based on tonne- kilometres, is approximately 70% road, 25% rail and 5% water.
Employee matters, including working conditions
and human rights, in respect of AGRANA employees The basis for AGRANA’s relationship with its employees
is set out in the AGRANA Code of Conduct, which,
for instance, prohibits any discrimination or harassment, forbids child labour and forced labour, addresses issues of health and safety in the workplace, and affirms the rights of free association and collective bargaining.
By complying with its Code of Conduct, the Group expects to avoid or minimise economic risks for AGRANA (for example, difficulties in employee recruitment, inefficient operating processes, strikes and reputational damage) and social risks for employees (e.g., a work environment that
is unsafe, hazardous to health, discriminatory or unfair).
Group management report
  46

 The employment relationships of about 73% of AGRANA employees worldwide fall under collective agreements. The interests of approximately 78% of staff are represented by a local employee council or union representative. At those sites where neither of these forms of representation exists, AGRANA has set up complaint boxes as a formal channel available to all employees for reporting griev- ances regarding labour practices or human rights. A process is in place for the prompt and fair handling of the com- plaints received.
SEDEX membership and SMETA audits
Since 2009, AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG is a member of the Supplier Ethical Exchange Database (SEDEX). All AGRANA production sites perform an annual SEDEX self-assess- ment, which focuses primarily on working conditions, workplace safety and human rights (including questions on child labour and forced labour). In the 2017|18 financial year, all Sugar segment plants within the GRI reporting boundaries (see page 43) and all Austrian manufacturing sites of the Starch segment had their self-assessments verified through so-called “4-Pillar SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audits” (SMETA) performed by independent third parties. Overall, at the balance sheet date, about 58%
of the AGRANA production sites within the GRI reporting boundaries had valid SMETA or comparable social audits. No significant violations were found. The SMETA audit reports on the AGRANA plants are available to SEDEX members on the organisation’s online platform.
The areas of focus in 2017|18 regarding working conditions and human rights in relation to AGRANA employees
are discussed in the section “AGRANA’s people” (see from page 82).
Anti-corruption and anti-bribery, compliance with laws and regulations, and business conduct
The risks, management approaches and activities in 2017|18 surrounding compliance and business conduct, anti-cor- ruption and anti-bribery are presented in the compliance section (see from page 27) of the corporate governance report.
Social matters
Product responsibility and sustainable products
Product safety and quality
The foremost aim of the AGRANA quality policy is to produce foods and feedstuffs that meet customer require- ments and are safe for consumption. For AGRANA, adher- ing to the many applicable national and international regulations for product safety at all production sites world- wide is not just a legal obligation but also a cornerstone of the Group’s social responsibility and essential to sustain- able development.
Foods manufactured at facilities within the European Union meet the requirements of the EU’s General Food Law Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, as amended. This regulation lays down the general principles and require- ments of food law, establishes the European Food Safety Authority and sets out procedures concerning food
safety. In addition, AGRANA is guided by the international minimum standards for food safety, such as the Codex Alimentarius (the food code of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the World Health Organisation). In the Codex Alimentarius, the General Principles of Food Hygiene introduce the so-called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system. The HACCP system permits the analysis
of potential hazards to human health, whether chemical, physical or microbial in nature. The principle of an HACCP system is also found, for example, as a legal require- ment in the EU hygiene regulation (Reg. (EC) No 852/2005). AGRANA has already been using HACCP systems in its plants for many years, adapted to the particular produc- tion processes. The introduction and especially the regular auditing of an HACCP system ensure that only safe products leave the facility.
Animal feeds produced at facilities in the EU meet
the requirements of the EU’s General Food Law Regulation No 178/2002, its Regulation No 767/2009 on bringing
to market and using feeds, and Regulation No 183/2005 on feed hygiene. Here too, HACCP systems are integral to ensuring product safety.
In its assurance of food and feed safety, AGRANA goes beyond the legal requirements and has implemented inter- nationally recognised standards of product safety, under which it is externally certified.
The AGRANA quality management system seeks to identify and optimally fulfil the expectations and requirements
of customers and other interested parties. It is based on the principles of ISO 9001, the international norm for quality management systems. AGRANA’s quality manage- ment system is supplemented by numerous certifications for food safety and food defence. The most important standards in this respect globally for AGRANA are
FSSC 22000 (Food Safety System Certification), ISO 22000 and IFS (International Food Standard). Depending on
the country or region and customer demand, additional certifications are also offered, such as Organic, GMO-Free, Kosher (following Jewish dietary laws) and Halal (adher- ing to Islamic dietary laws). The key standards for feed safety are GMP Feed and the EFISC Feed Standard. Overall in the 2017|18 financial year, 100% of AGRANA’s feed production sites held certifications to at least one of these standards, or to the locally relevant international ones.

 The hygiene and quality standards of the foods and feeds produced by AGRANA are continually raised further through external certifications, customer and supplier audits and an internal audit system. No product recalls were required in 2017|18.
Disseminating knowledge on nutrition and health
In 2017|18, sugar continued to encounter a negative perception in the public debate and in media reporting related to nutrition and health. The impression is created that sugar is responsible for most of the ills of our modern society, and none more so than obesity.
Thus, in the past several years, eight EU countries have introduced taxes on sugar-containing beverages, mostly by raising the related consumption taxes. Worldwide
as well, some industrialised nations and emerging-market countries have taken comparable measures.
Prompted by the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the proportion of sugar in daily energy intake, there is growing pressure on the European Commission and the EU member states to act regarding product reformulations. In 2016 the EU member states agreed that by 2020, relative to the base year 2015, the amount of so-called added sugars in the total food supply is to be reduced by 10%. However, as it has turned out,
a sugar tax does not make people slim. Weight gain in healthy individuals is simple to explain: More calories are taken in than expended. Whether these calories come from fat, protein, sugar or other carbohydrates makes no difference to the energy balance. This is also why the reformulation efforts that aim to reduce products’ sugar content in favour of other ingredients will not lead to a breakthrough in the fight against obesity: Most such refor- mulated products – contrary to consumers’ assumption – are not significantly lower in calories.
AGRANA therefore works to raise the level of public knowledge about nutrition in general, the importance of lifestyle to health, and the properties of sugar.
In the 2017|18 financial year, AGRANA supported initiatives that communicate nutritional and health knowledge, such as Austria’s Forum Health Today (“Forum Ernährung heute”), the Austrian Nutrition Society (“Österreichische Gesellschaft für Ernährung“) and the platform “Land Grows Life” (“Land schafft Leben”).
Through its sponsorship of SK Rapid, a Vienna football club, AGRANA wants to motivate the public to adopt a healthy, active lifestyle that includes more exercise in daily life. AGRANA sees young people as a particularly important audience in this regard, as the foundations for a healthy
way of life are laid at an early age. In the year, AGRANA thus supported numerous events of SK Rapid for children and youth, like “Greenie Day” (when the professional team plays with the kids’ teams, in the club’s green uniforms), the Wiener Zucker Kids Run, the Wiener Zucker U9 tournament and the youth camps of SK Rapid Vienna.
AGRANA also supported the Charity Walk of the Austrian umbrella organisation for environmental protection, which links physical exercise in nature to a donation that will benefit local biodiversity.
In parallel with this, AGRANA helps foster its
own employees’ knowledge and awareness of balanced nutrition and a healthy lifestyle through many activities (see the section “AGRANA’s people” from page 82).
Customer satisfaction
At the end of the 2017|18 financial year a customer satisfaction survey was conducted in the fruit preparations business. For the first time the survey was carried
out not just online but also through telephone interviews. The results were not yet available at the reporting date. The next global survey of the customers of all business segments is planned for March 2019.
Organic products
AGRANA holds the necessary certifications in its plants and supply chain to be able to fill customer needs for organically made foods, feeds and other products.
As significant volume of demand for organics is limited mostly to Austria, Germany and the USA, the organic portion of AGRANA’s total sales quantities is a percentage in the single digits.
Social engagement
Memberships in sustainability-related initiatives and
in industry associations and advocacy groups
Beyond striving to maximise the environmental and social sustainability of its core business activities, AGRANA is also engaged as a responsible corporate citizen in its host communities. As part of this engagement, AGRANA is involved in various sustainability-related initiatives and in industry associations and advocacy groups.
Sponsorship engagements
As in the previous years, in 2017|18 the AGRANA Group supported a large number of social projects in the communities where its companies operate, and many cultural events in Austria.

           The AGRANA Group’s revenue in the 2017|18 financial year was € 2,566.3 million and thus remained steady on balance at the prior-year level. While revenue in the Sugar segment, at € 652.6 million, showed a slight sugar-price-related decrease of 2.9%, revenue in the Starch segment rose somewhat, by 2.5% to € 752.3 million, thanks in part to higher volumes of core products. Fruit segment revenue, at € 1,161.4 million (up 0.5%) was closely in line with the prior year.

Operating profit (EBIT), at € 190.6 million, grew by a significant 10.6% from the prior year. EBIT in
the Sugar segment improved substantially, to € 34.8 million (prior year: € 24.4 million), thanks largely to higher selling prices in the first six months than one year earlier. The largest EBIT contribution
(of € 80.2 million) was achieved in the Starch segment, where this earnings measure improved further (by 5.2%) from the prior year’s record level, buoyed mainly by a positive trajectory in the ethanol business. In the Fruit segment, EBIT increased by 5.3% to € 75.6 million despite a reduced contribution from the fruit juice concentrate business. Details on the share of results of equity-accounted joint ventures and on exceptional items can be found in the segment reports and the consolidated financial statements.

Net financial items amounted to a net expense of € 14.5 million in the 2017|18 financial year (prior year: net expense of € 17.9 million), an improvement driven by two developments. First, an optimisa- tion of the credit and interest rate structure reduced the interest expense by € 2.3 million. Second, the prior year included a non-recurring expense for an impairment charge of € 4.8 million on a current finance receivable in Ukraine in the Fruit segment. Compared to this base, the year under review saw an improvement of € 4.3 million in other financial items. Currency translation differences (including currency derivatives) deteriorated by about € 2.7 million, due primarily to negative movements in foreign currency financings in Argentina and Brazil (euro and US dollar financings).

            Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was up € 44.7 million year-on-year at a
new total of € 302.7 million. After an increase of € 43.1 million in working capital (prior year: decrease
of € 31.8 million) and a higher income tax expense, net cash from operating activities decreased to
€ 213.9 million (prior year: € 255.8 million). Net cash used in investing activities was € 133.3 million. This significant decrease from one year earlier came despite higher outflows for purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, and is explained by the prior year’s expenses for the acquisi- tion in Argentina (prior year: net cash use of € 171.5 million in investing activities). Net cash use of
€ 153.7 million in financing activities reflected the dividend payment and the repayment of borrowings. The prior year’s net cash of € 9.3 million from financing activities had resulted mainly from the capital increase in February 2017. Free cash flow in the year under review eased by 4.4% year-on-year.

An expansion of € 25.7 million in non-current assets was driven especially by investment in property, plant and equipment that exceeded depreciation. Inventories declined moderately for volume and price reasons, by € 41.5 million; trade receivables also showed a moderate reduction, of € 27.0 million. In combination with markedly lower cash and cash equivalents (down € 77.5 million), this led to a significant decrease in current assets.

AGRANA’s equity ratio of 61.7% represented an improvement of 4.8 percentage points from the year-earlier level of 56.9%. On the other side of the balance sheet, non-current liabilities rose signifi- cantly, due primarily to an increase of € 130.1 million in long-term borrowings. Current liabilities showed a pronounced decrease, reflecting among other factors the reduction of current borrowings (down € 215.1 million) and a drop of € 51.8 million in trade payables.
Net debt as of 28 February 2018, at € 232.5 million, was down € 7.4 million from the 2016|17 year-end level. The gearing ratio thus amounted to 16.0% at the balance sheet date (28 February 2017: 17.0%).

The Sugar segment’s revenue in 2017|18, at € 652.6 million, was off 2.9% from the year before. The decrease resulted in part from a slight reduction in average sugar selling prices for the year.
Until the end of September, average sugar prices in 2017 were still significantly higher than one year earlier. Since the new, 2017|18 sugar marketing year (which began on 1 October 2017 and runs to
30 September 2018), prices plummeted both for retail sugar and for sugar sold to industrial customers. Revenue from by-products rose moderately, driven primarily by a higher sales volume of dried beet pulp, and revenue with ancillary goods (INSTANTINA products, seed, services, etc.) increased slightly. The Sugar segment accounted for 25.4% of Group revenue (prior year: 26.2%).
EBIT grew from € 24.4 million to € 34.8 million, still benefiting in the first six months from an environ- ment of higher sales price compared to the year-earlier period. Since the financial third quarter – the first to fall into the new 2017|18 sugar marketing year – the earnings measure “operating
profit before exceptional items and results of equity-accounted joint ventures” declined significantly. Exceptional items in 2017|18 amounted to a net expense of € 2.9 million and stemmed largely
from costs of restructuring (prior year: net expense of € 9.0 million, on negative one-time effects in Romania).
Further details on the results in the Sugar business are given in the segment report from page 58.

Revenue in the Starch segment in 2017|18 was € 752.3 million, up slightly by 2.5% from the previous year. Key positive drivers were higher sales volumes of starches (particularly organic and specialty grades) and saccharification products, and higher bioethanol prices in the first nine months, than one year earlier. The significant decrease in reselling volume of feedstuffs caused a moderate reduction in by-product revenue compared to the prior year, despite higher in-house production. The Starch segment accounted for 29.3% of the Group’s revenue (prior year: 28.7%).
The segment’s EBIT of € 80.2 million surpassed the prior year’s record result by 5.2% and translated into an EBIT margin of 10.7% (prior year: 10.4%). Raw material prices were in line with the prior year. While the start-up costs for the commissioning of the facility expansion in Aschach, Austria (primarily as a result of increased staff costs and depreciation) in themselves detracted from earnings, lower energy prices and higher annual average ethanol quotations allowed EBIT improvements to be achieved in the Starch segment. As well, there was a moderate increase in the profit contribution from the equity-accounted HUNGRANA facility, due largely to the year-on-year increase in sales prices of bioethanol.

Fruit segment revenue in 2017|18 was € 1,161.4 million (up 0.5%), or very close to the year-earlier level. In the fruit preparations business, a small increase in sales volumes together with stable selling prices added up to slight revenue growth. In the fruit juice concentrate activities, revenue decreased

slightly as a result partly of lower concentrate prices for product from the 2016 crop compared to 2015. The Fruit segment was responsible for 45.3% of Group revenue (prior year: 45.1%).
EBIT reached a new high of € 75.6 million, rising by 5.3% from the prior year. While the fruit pre- parations activities generated significant earnings growth, EBIT in the fruit juice concentrate business declined significantly in the third quarter as a result of underutilised capacity amid lower avail- ability of apples.
Further details on the results in the Fruit business are supplied in the segment report from page 72.

The overall sales volume of sugar products decreased slightly in 2017|18 compared to the prior year, with differences between markets. While sales quantities with the reseller market rose somewhat, volumes with the sugar-using industry were off. Export volumes – sales both within and outside the EU – fell short of the prior year’s level.
Sugar revenue was below the value of the prior year, which was partly explained by the lower average sales prices in the year under review. The sugar price reduction was particularly noticeable in prices with wholesalers and retailers in the Eastern European countries; in Austria the prior-year levels were largely maintained.
The earnings growth was driven predominantly by higher sugar sales prices in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period one year earlier. Since the financial third quarter – the first to fall into the new 2017|18 sugar marketing year which began 1 October 2017 – operating profitability in terms of the earnings measure “operating profit before exceptional items and results of equity- accounted joint ventures” declined significantly.
The result of the AGRANA-STUDEN group, which is included in the consolidated financial statements by the equity method of accounting, had a negative effect on the Sugar segment’s EBIT in 2017|18.
The reduction of € 3.5 million in the earnings contribution compared to the prior year was attribut- able to the end of the sugar quotas and the resulting negative impacts for sugar refining operations in the Western Balkans, as lower beet sugar prices led to measures such as the placing of the AGRANA- STUDEN refinery in Bosnia and Herzegovina on stand-by at the beginning of November 2017.

The net exceptional items expense of € 2.9 million in the 2017|18 financial year resulted largely from restructuring costs of € 4.1 million, which were partly offset by one-off income of € 1.9 million from the refunding of excess amounts of sugar production levies collected by the EU in the 1999|00 and 2000|01 sugar marketing years.
In the prior year, the net exceptional items expense of
€ 9.0 million represented tax liabilities of € 11.5 million in connection with a tax audit in Romania, the creation of
a provision of € 1.5 million for a legal dispute in Romania, and the release of a € 4.0 million provision for a settled legal dispute in the Czech Republic.
Market environment
World sugar market
For the end of the 2017|18 sugar marketing year (SMY,
1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018) the analytics firm F. O. Licht in its estimate of 23 January 2018 for the world sugar balance is forecasting a production surplus, coming after two years of deficits. The forecast calls for a production increase to 189.7 million tonnes (SMY 2016|17: 179.5 million tonnes) which, despite predicted further growth in consumption to 183.9 million tonnes (SMY 2016|17: 180.7 million tonnes), is to lead to an expansion in global sugar stocks to 71.1 million tonnes (SMY 2016|17: 67.2 million tonnes).
While the very volatile world market prices for sugar in the 2016|17 financial year still saw a four-year high in September 2016 for white sugar at US$ 612.0 per tonne, and in October 2016 for raw sugar at US$ 524.9 per tonne, the following months brought continuing highly volatile quotations, with a declining trend that accelerated further in the course of the 2017|18 financial year. One of the main reasons for this is the latest set of estimates for the global sugar surplus in SMY 2017|18, which is driven partly by the good to very good harvests in major beet and cane production regions such as the EU, India and other Asian countries.
For 2018, although Brazil is expected to use more sugar cane for ethanol production than before, analysts predict significant growth in global sugar output, reflecting very good crop expectations in India and Thailand and con- tinuing high beet sugar production in Europe. The actual extent of the expected global production surplus will very much depend on developments in Brazil. The movements in the Brazilian real, especially in connection with the 2018 presidential elections, and the currency’s resulting effect on the relative production of sugar versus ethanol will represent another important factor.
At the end of the reporting period (28 February 2018), white sugar quoted at US$ 361.3 per tonne and raw sugar at US$ 297.2.
EU sugar market
The first predictions in May 2017 for the 2017|18 sugar beet harvest already estimated a 16% increase in planting area in Europe. Ultimately, the 2017|18 campaign
brought an increase of 18% in the area planted to sugar beet. Favourable weather during the final growth stage
of the sugar beet led to a harvest with an average yield of 76.7 tonnes per hectare, which was 6.7% above the five-

year average. The European Commission is forecasting sugar production in the EU for SMY 2017|18 at about 20.6 million tonnes (prior SMY: 17.3 million tonnes)1. In Austria, AGRANA’s main beet production region, the cultivation area of about 41,400 hectares yielded
an average of around 72 tonnes of beet per hectare.
According to the official sugar price reporting of the EU, prices in the past months were on a clear downward trend; while the average price of sugar in the EU in September 2017 was still € 490 per tonne, in January 2018 it was only € 374 per tonne.
Currently the sugar imports under the EPA/EBA2 agree- ments and the treaty with the ACP3 countries in the ongoing 2017|18 sugar marketing year are also far below the volumes of the prior year. Applications for sugar import licences are subdued as well. These developments are related to the high EU production volume and the decline in EU prices. The EU is thus developing from a net importer into a net exporter.
Customers in industry and resellers
The high sugar selling prices in the first seven months of the financial year were still due largely to the low European sugar inventories prevailing until the start of the new 2017 harvest and to the initially still high world market prices in the first half of 2017|18.
Sugar sales in the last five months of the year were defined by the renegotiated prices with customers in industry and resellers. The fact that the sugar quota has expired, com- bined with the low world market prices and expected high sugar production, confronts the entire European sugar industry – as well as its customers – with new challenges.
The sugar prices contractually set for SMY 2017|18 are now significantly lower than for the previous year.
Even after the expiration of the European quota rules, AGRANA firmly intends to cement and where possible expand its existing market shares with industrial custom- ers and resellers. The product and brand strategy adopted was validated by a positive overall business performance in the first three quarters of 2017|18, even if sales prices came under pressure since autumn 2017.
Especially in the resellers segment and in exports
to markets outside the EU, growth in sales quantities was achieved relative to the prior year. In sales to resellers, this positive trend across all countries was due primarily to an increase in the use of sugar for fruit preserving and for baking. Overall, the sales volume of sugar specialties and certified organic sugar is rising, with further potential for growth especially in Eastern Europe.
EU sugar policy
Since 1 October 2017 the European sugar industry is operating in a new environment. The biggest changes are the end of the production quotas for sugar and isoglu- cose and the abolition of the minimum beet prices.
However, the use of contracts between the sugar industry and sugar beet growers remains a requirement. The European Commission also retains the option to apply exceptional measures in the event of crises. One of the instruments available to it for this purpose is government- funded private storage, through which the Commission can temporarily remove sugar from the market.
A key element of the liberalisation of the EU sugar market is that, since 1 October 2017, the European sugar manufacturers have unrestricted freedom to export their product.
Protective features remaining in place unchanged for imports to the EU from countries not party to preferential treaties are the duties of € 419 per tonne for white sugar and € 339 per tonne for raw sugar. The preferential agree- ments (for duty-free access) with the Least Developed Countries and the ACP Group of States remain intact, as do the duty-free or lower-duty preferential imports that are subject to volume limits.
Free trade agreements
The European Commission is currently negotiating
the terms of a free trade agreement with the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The European beet farmers and sugar companies seek to prevent concessions by the EU to the Mercosur countries on sugar and products with a high sugar content, as Brazil already has extensive preferential access to the EU sugar market and the Brazilian government continues
to intervene in the sugar policy of the world’s largest sugar producer through a multitude of direct and indirect state subsidies. As a result of these subsidies, sugar
from Austria and Europe suffers unfair competition from Brazilian sugar.

Raw materials and production
The area of sugar beet fields harvested by AGRANA’s approximately 6,900 contract beet farmers in SMY 2017|18 was about 96,300 hectares (prior SMY: about 93,200 hectares); almost 1,700 hectares of this (prior SMY: 1,300 hectares) represented organic production. From the organic acreage
the Group produced around 9,000 tonnes of organic beet sugar (prior year: about 8,500 tonnes).
In many production regions the relatively low precipitation and very hot temperatures during
the entire growing period did not allow the beet stocks to develop well. Not until autumn 2017 did the situation improve, thanks to cool weather and ample rain. In many regions the beet stocks recovered and exhibited superior growth until up to the harvest. Only in the eastern part of the Austrian production areas, in the whole Slovak cultivation region and those Hungarian areas bordering on Austria did the beet stocks remain sub-average. The crop was harvested under relatively good conditions, except for a brief interruption in September due to heavy precipitation. As a result of the weather conditions described, the mean sugar content of the beet, at 17.2%, was above average (prior year: 16.7%). The AGRANA Group processed about 6.2 million tonnes of beet,
or approximately 0.5 million tonnes less than in the prior year despite a small increase in acreage.
AGRANA’s seven beet sugar factories processed a combined daily average of about 51,500 tonnes
of beet during the campaign (prior year: 49,400 tonnes). Over an average campaign length of
120 days (prior year: 136 days), the beet was used to produce approximately 941,000 tonnes of sugar (prior year: about 1 million tonnes). In the 2017|18 financial year AGRANA also refined approxi- mately 200,100 tonnes of white sugar equivalent from raw sugar (prior year: 263,200 tonnes). To also assure a sustainable supply chain for raw sugar as an input product, AGRANA since 2014 holds a Chain of Custody certification under the internationally recognised Bonsucro standard for all
its refining facilities. The Chain of Custody certificate, which confirms the adherence to high social and environmental standards in the entire value chain, entitles AGRANA’s customers to display the Bonsucro logo on their products. Bonsucro is accorded gold status, the highest rating, by the benchmarking tool of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI).
For beet purchasing, AGRANA follows a beet price arrangement with a variable price schedule tied to the sugar sales price.
Engagement in the upstream value chain
Supplier environmental and social assessment
The AGRANA principles for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products stipulate the use of good agricultural practice (GAP) and fair working conditions.
In accordance with these principles, the Sugar segment has elected to use the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) for documenting sustainable management for its sugar beet contract growers. For details on the SAI and FSA, see the section
“Non-financial information statement under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code”, page 44.
In the 2017|18 financial year the previously voluntary completion of the FSA questionnaire became mandatory for some contract suppliers. In accordance with the SAI FSA Implementation Frame- work published in June 2016, selected farmers in all five beet-growing countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia) participated in the mandatory FSA self-assessment and the external audits to SAI standards. Based on the results of the external verification, AGRANA’s Sugar segment is entitled to claim gold or silver status under SAI standards for more than 75% of the statistical population of all sugar beet growers. AGRANA’s minimum requirements are fulfilled by all contract beet growers; areas of potential for improvement identified by the audits are addressed through existing training programmes.

 Building awareness of good agricultural practice
In June 2017 the annual BETAEXPO field symposium focused on crop protection and reflected the political debate over the use of specific groups of crop protection agents (see the section “Non-financial information statement under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code” from page 44). In the 2017|18 financial year, AGRANA also again carried out many awareness-building events under its “Mont Blanc” efficiency improvement programme, which aims to increase sugar yield per hectare and reduce production costs. In fields of contract farmers in Austria, AGRANA took about 1,100 soil samples for EUF analysis1, with the sample locations mapped by GPS, to support needs-appropriate, precision fertiliser planning. At the
85 demonstration farms across the entire beet-growing region of the AGRANA Group, 150 field tours and eight field days with a total of more than 7,500 participants were held during the growing season. Strong audience interest was also shown in a one-day organic agriculture con- ference for all organic crops processed by AGRANA, which was organised by the Sugar and Starch segments in collaboration with BIO Austria.
Biodiversity in the supply chain
In 2017, about 5,000 hectares were greened in Austria with the catch-crop mix from Österreichische Rübensamen- zucht GmbH, a not-for-profit subsidiary of AGRANA Zucker GmbH that makes GMO-free seed (largely produced in-house) available to the contract farmers. The catch-crop loosens the soil structure, mobilises nutrients, activates

soil fauna and improves field biodiversity. In addition, flowered areas of annuals and perennials were estab- lished; together, the flowering fields provide ideal forage for wild animals, offer honey plants for bees, and add
to the beauty of the landscape.
Transport
Although the transport of raw materials and sugar products only represents a comparatively low 5% to 10% of the Sugar segment’s carbon footprint (depending
on the calculation method and country), AGRANA strives to make transport as sustainable as infrastructure and economics will allow. In total across all production countries in the 2017|18 processing season, about 36% of the beet was delivered to the sugar factories by rail, with the proportion highest in Hungary at about 65%.
Environmental and energy topics
in AGRANA’s production
Energy consumption and emissions in processing
The average specific direct energy consumption per tonne of product (both core and by-products) in the Sugar segment eased by about 3.8% in the 2017|18 financial year compared to one year earlier. This reduction is due to improved modes of operation in the extraction stage and better waste heat recovery in low-temperature drying operations, especially at the sugar plant in Leopoldsdorf, Austria. At the factory in Tulln, Austria, the weather-in-

The increase in average specific water consumption per tonne of product (core and by-products) of about 32.5% was attributable to a higher need for cooling water at several sites. As a result of the higher water consumption, the average specific amount of wastewater per tonne of product also rose, by 14.9%.

 duced bottlenecks in beet supply were made up for through increased processing of so-called thick juice, thus holding energy consumption per unit of product output at a good level. The Group’s improved specific processing capacity of 4% as well has a positive effect on this energy indicator.
The Kaposvár sugar plant in Hungary generated about
31.3 million cubic metres of biogas from beet pulp in the 2017|18 financial year. This would have been sufficient
to cover approximately 71% of the site’s primary energy requirement for the 2017|18 beet campaign. About 9.2 mil- lion cubic metres of the biogas produced at the facility (containing about 54% methane) were refined by the biogas upgrading plant installed in autumn 2015 into approxi- mately 5.2 million cubic metres (prior year: 4.8 million cubic metres) of biomethane (100% methane) for feeding into the local natural gas grid. The biomethane injected into the grid was equivalent to the annual heating requirement of about 2,090 single-family homes (prior year: 1,950 homes)
In the 2017|18 financial year the Sugar segment thus already met the target for 2020|21 of reducing direct energy consumption per tonne of product output to 2.49 GJ.
As a result of the lower steam requirement thanks
to the efficiency measures taken, the cogeneration plants also generated less electric power. This lower internal generation of electricity had to be compensated for by higher external sourcing of power, which led to an increase of about 7.4% in specific indirect energy use per tonne of product compared to the prior year.
On balance, the average specific emissions from direct and indirect energy consumption per tonne of product thus decreased by about 3.5% from the prior year (see chart
on page 62).
Water use at AGRANA’s sugar plants in 2017|18, by source1
In the 2017|18 financial year the energy management systems of the Sugar segment’s production sites already certified to ISO 50001 in 2014|15 were recertified.
One hundred percent of the production sites within the GRI reporting boundaries (see page 43) thus hold a current certification.
Water use and discharge in processing
The water required by a sugar factory is partly obtained from the beet itself. Sugar beet has a water content of about 75%, which must be separated from the sugar during the manufacturing process. This water is used both to leach the sugar out of the beet cossettes and to trans- port and clean the beet. The water is continually cleaned and returned to the process cycle. In-house or municipal wastewater treatment plants at all sites ensure the environ- mentally responsible treatment of the effluent in compli- ance with local government requirements. When the cleaned wastewater is discharged into the receiving water, it thus meets the applicable environmental standards.

Waste from processing
The absolute amount of waste eased by 3.5% from the previous year. The increase in hazardous waste resulted from the disposal, performed only on an irregular basis every few years, of materials such as used oil and used laboratory chemicals, railway ties, fibre cement panels, fluorescent tubes replaced by new lights, etc.

Biodiversity at (former) production sites
The settling ponds on the grounds of AGRANA’s former sugar plant (closed in 2006) in Hohenau an der March, Austria, were repurposed, working together with the AURING conservationist club. Located in an area of high diversity value identified under the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands2, the ponds now serve as a staging area
for water birds, most notably waders.
EcoVadis
In summer 2017, AGRANA Zucker GmbH updated its sustainability data, first provided in 2014, for the purposes of EcoVadis, the international supplier evaluation platform, and improved its status from bronze to silver.
Investment
In the Sugar segment, AGRANA invested € 32.1 million during the 2017|18 financial year (prior year: € 23.3 million) in, among other things, product quality and energy efficiency. The most significant projects included the following:

In the Starch segment, revenue grew by 2.5% in the 2017|18 financial year compared to the year before. In core products the revenue growth was about 6%, while revenue with by-products was down moderately, owing particularly to lower volumes in reselling of feedstuffs. The overall sales volume was approximately in line with the prior year, while the quantity of core products sold increased by nearly 4%. In large part the growth was based on higher production as a result of the commissioning of the plant expansion in Aschach, Austria (starch and saccharification products), but all other factories also ran at high levels of utilisation.
The market prices for native starches reflected the rise in demand; in modified starches the market position was expanded, especially in the areas of specialty and organic products. Since the liberalisation of the European sugar market at the beginning of October 2017, sugar prices in Europe are moving within a low band, owing to greater competition in the EU, beet sugar surpluses and low world market quotations. As a consequence, the starch-based saccharification products too are marked by mounting pressure on prices and margins. In the financial year under review, bioethanol quotations remained volatile but were above the prior year’s levels on average. Prices for feedstuffs eased slightly.

Regarding costs, grain prices moved sideways in the year. Savings were realised on energy prices. The higher average ethanol prices for the year also had a positive effect on earnings. The commissioning (the start of production) of the plant expansion in Aschach, Austria, led to one-time start-up costs. Specifically, the project-related investment and the additional personnel resulted in significantly increased plant depreciation and staff costs. The above factors were reflected in the growth rates of earnings: EBITDA was up by 9.2% to € 76.5 million; at the same time, operating profit before exceptional items and results of equity-accounted joint ventures increased by 3.5% to
€ 49.8 million.
In the 2017|18 financial year, revenue of the HUNGRANA group, the joint venture in Hungary, declined by 3.2%, even if price gains were achieved in the isoglucose product area. In bioethanol, lower production and sales quantities were juxtaposed with higher sales prices, but the net effect was still a decrease in HUNGRANA’s revenue. With raw material prices stable at the prior year’s
levels and with a reduced corporate tax rate in Hungary, HUNGRANA’s net profit surpassed the prior year by 8.3% and its contribution to the earnings of the Starch segment thus also rose moderately.
Market environment
The food starch segment was steady in terms of sales quantities and the prices for native and modified starch products moved higher, thanks not least to impetus from the non-food sector.
The principal upside driver in non-food starches was the demand from the paper and corrugated board industry. This positive trend is fuelled by the steady growth of
the online mail order market, which stimulates consump- tion of corrugated board and container board. Numerous capacity expansion projects by the paper industry are contributing to the firm demand.
The strategic further development of the customer and market portfolio of AGRANA Stärke GmbH towards greater specialisation is visible in sales volume growth
in the international markets for construction starches and for adhesives, as well as in starch products with higher value-added and made from special raw materials. For example, significant growth was recorded in spray-dried saccharification products, where AGRANA gained market share, especially in the organic segment.
The European market for potato starch is established;
the growing Latin America and Asia regions are becoming attractive export destinations for AGRANA Stärke GmbH.
In by-products, prices of high-protein products main- tained a firm trend; vital wheat gluten in particular showed an upward movement in prices. Aside from the bakery industry, fish feed and pet food were the main market segments generating impetus for demand. Medium-protein feeds (Actiprot® and corn gluten feed) on the other hand are closely coupled to the soy, grain and corn markets and are thus subject to greater pressure on prices.
The environment for starch-based saccharification products, especially the isoglucose business, is determined mainly by the trajectory of the sugar market and sugar prices.
The isoglucose quota in the final year of the volume limits under the EU sugar regime was unchanged at about 720,000 tonnes, of which HUNGRANA held the largest single share at 250,000 tonnes (the amount for this equity- accounted joint venture is stated at 100% of the total). This quota was abolished on 1 October 2017 as part of the liberalisation of the EU sugar market.
For liquid saccharification products, the anticipation
of this full liberalisation of the sugar markets led to very high competitive and price pressure even before the actual date of the quota expiration. Currently, as a result of the low sugar prices, customers’ willingness to substi- tute isoglucose for sugar is not very high.
The volatility of the European market for bioethanol remained substantial in the 2017|18 financial year; after months of a close correlation between supply and demand in the EU market and firm prices in a range from € 530
to € 590 per cubic metre FOB Rotterdam, a significantly lower price range of € 455 to € 480 per cubic metre established itself since the beginning of October. Supported by the very good sugar beet crops of the 2017 campaign, more sugar beet thick juice and molasses were used for ethanol production again.
More information on the economic policy environment and market conditions for ethanol is provided in the section “Risk management” (subheading “EU Renewable Energy Directive”).

Raw materials and production
World grain production in the 2017|18 grain marketing year (1 July to 30 June) is estimated by the International Grains Council (IGC)1 at 2.09 billion tonnes, which marks a small decrease from the prior year’s level and is less than the expected consumption. Global wheat production is forecast at 757 million tonnes (prior year: 754 million tonnes), compared to expected consumption of 743 million tonnes. The world’s corn production is projected at
1,048 million tonnes (prior year: 1,088 million tonnes), versus expected consumption of 1,068 million tonnes. Total grain stocks are estimated to decline by about 13 million tonnes to a new balance of 610 million tonnes.
Given the good worldwide supply situation for grains, futures prices declined over the financial year. On
28 February 2018 on the NYSE Euronext Liffe commodity derivatives exchange in Paris, wheat quoted at € 167 per tonne and corn at € 156 per tonne (prior year: € 172 per tonne for wheat and € 171 for corn). The reason lay in the very good US corn harvest and the good grain crops in Western Europe in 2017.
Potatoes
In the 2017|18 campaign the potato starch plant in Gmünd, Austria, in a campaign lasting 164 days (prior year: 149 days), processed about 260,700 tonnes of starch potatoes (prior year: 238,900 tonnes) with an average starch content of 18.0% (prior year: 19.6%). Approximately 25,600 tonnes of food potatoes (prior year: 24,800 tonnes) were converted into about 4,200 tonnes of long-life potato products (prior year: 4,400 tonnes).
Corn and wheat
The corn processing volume of AGRANA Stärke GmbH in Austria for starch products (excluding ethanol) increased in the 2017|18 financial year to about 442,700 tonnes (prior year: about 416,000 tonnes) due to the expansion of the corn processing capacity in Aschach, Austria. Of
this total, about 113,7002 tonnes was wet corn (prior year: about 121,000 tonnes). The share of specialty corn processed (waxy corn, organic corn and certified non-GMO corn) increased to approximately 132,200 tonnes (prior year: about 131,000 tonnes).
At the wheat starch factory in Pischelsdorf, Austria, in 2017|18, a net raw material volume of about 191,200 tonnes of wheat was used in the production of wheat starch (prior year: 198,000 tonnes). In the attached bioethanol plant, about 656,000 tonnes (prior year: 637,000 tonnes) of grain were processed, with a ratio of about 60% wheat (including triticale) to 40% corn. Of the 2017 crop, about 86,400 tonnes of ethanol wheat and ethanol triticale were secured in advance through delivery contracts with growers. As in the prior years, cultivation contracts for ethanol grains were offered for the 2018 crop.
At the HUNGRANA plant in Hungary, a total of about
1.1 million tonnes of corn was processed in 2017|18, down slightly from the prior year as a result of a technical malfunction; the amounts for this equity-accounted joint venture are stated at 100% of the respective total. The wet-corn processing here already began in the middle
of August 2017 thanks to dry weather and was completed at the end of December, at a total volume somewhat below that of the previous year. The plant in Romania processed about 69,000 tonnes of corn, a slight increase from the year before.

Supplier environmental and social assessment
In 2016|17 the Starch segment too, in accordance with the AGRANA principles for the procurement
of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products, which stipulate the use of good agricultural practice (GAP) and fair working conditions, continued to employ the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) for the documentation of sustainable manage- ment for its contract potato farmers. (For details on the SAI and FSA, see the section “Non-financial information statement under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code”, page 44).
In the 2017|18 financial year the previously voluntary completion of the FSA questionnaire became mandatory for some contract suppliers. In the Starch segment, Austrian contract potato growers selected in accordance with the SAI FSA Implementation Framework and its Audit Guideline participated in the mandatory FSA self-assessment and the external audits to SAI standards. Based on the results of the external verification, AGRANA’s Starch segment is entitled to claim gold or silver status under SAI standards for more than 75% of the statistical population of all Austrian contract potato growers. AGRANA’s minimum requirements are fulfilled by all Austrian contract potato growers; areas of potential for improvement identified by the audits are addressed through existing training programmes.
In the sourcing of sustainable raw materials for the production of wheat starch and bioethanol, AGRANA has been relying for years on inputs certified under systems recognised by the European Commission, such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) and the Austrian Agricultural Certification Scheme (AACS). Both the ISCC and AACS are accorded silver status in the SAI system.
BETAEXPO – Austria’s largest demonstration field for AGRANA raw material crops
The BETAEXPO field symposium in June 2017, featuring Austria’s largest demonstration field for AGRANA raw material crops, focused on crop protection and reflected the political debate over the use of specific groups of crop protection agents (for more details, see the section “Non-financial information statement under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code” from page 44).
Besides organising BETAEXPO, AGRANA also arranged many other dialog-rich events for its contract growers in the Starch segment. As in the previous years, AGRANA held a one-day event for new growers to provide information on the production of starch potatoes for industrial use, and arranged several field tours with potato and ethanol grain suppliers. AGRANA also supported a knowledge transfer conference of the Austrian Starch Potato Growers Association (VÖSK) by providing funding and content, with presentations on crop cultivation and economic efficiency of potato production; the well-attended event drew about 300 visitors. A field day for suppliers of industrial starch potatoes in October 2017 and an organic agriculture conference (see page 62) rounded out the programme for awareness-building about good agricultural practices. In the context of corn supply for starch production, a training in gentle, loss-free harvesting technique for contract farmers was held for the first time.
Biodiversity in the supply chain
The successful bat conservation project launched in summer 2013 in Austria’s Waldviertel district (see annual report 2014|15, page 64) was continued last year. Population counts in the spring
and autumn of 2017 showed dense bat colonisation and the arrival of a fifth species of bat. Barbastelle bats, a species identified in the Austrian Red List of endangered mammals, continued to make up more than seventy percent of the animals tallied.

Energy consumption and emissions in processing
The average specific direct energy consumption per tonne of product (both core and by-products) in the Starch segment rose by about 2.1% in the 2017|18 reporting period compared to one year earlier. This increase was due to the generation of more process steam at the plant in Pischels- dorf, Austria, as production volumes increased.
The average specific indirect energy consumption per tonne of product in the Starch segment fell by about 5.7% from the previous year thanks to the implementation of two heat recovery projects in Pischelsdorf.
On balance, the average specific emissions from direct and indirect energy consumption per tonne of product declined by about 2.2% from the prior year, due to
the greater use of renewable energy sources especially in the corn starch plants in Aschach, Austria, and Ţăndărei, Romania.
At the three Austrian starch manufacturing sites of Aschach, Gmünd and Pischelsdorf, an energy management system was introduced in autumn 2014 and certified under ISO 50001. In the 2017|18 financial year they were recertified. The site in Romania holds a current energy audit certification. Aiming for continual improvement, the Starch segment is targeting site-specific efficiency gains amounting to a cumulative reduction of 50 GWh of energy use by 2020|21 through efficiency-boosting projects in individual sections of the plants. By means of the energy conservation projects in 2017|18, this target was already exceeded. To date about 54 GWh of reductions were achieved, through conservation projects such as the pre- warming of the mash and purge in ethanol distillation
at the site in Pischelsdorf, Austria, replacement of the protein decanters in Gmünd, Austria, and a new steam boiler in Aschach, Austria.

 Water use and discharge in processing
At the AGRANA starch plants, in keeping with the Group’s environmental policy, water use and effluent are managed sustainably. Process water in the starch operations is repeatedly recycled and cleaned.
Waste from processing
The specific amount of waste from processing per tonne of product (core and by-products) was 62.3% higher
in 2017|18 than the year before. This change is explained largely by the higher volume of product waste associated with the commissioning of the expansion of the Aschach, Austria, corn starch plant. However, this additional waste was reused.

 The reported average specific water consumption
per tonne of product (core and by-products) in the Starch segment increased by about 11.8% in the financial year compared to the prior year. This year-on-year change
was attributable solely to the more exact measurement of water use at the combined wheat starch and bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, through the installation of additional meters. Average specific water discharge eased by about 1.4%.

Biodiversity at production sites
At the site of the combined wheat starch and bioethanol factory in Pischelsdorf, Austria, a project was launched
in the 2016|17 financial year to return the grounds of the complex to a more natural state. In addition to planting flowering hedges as honey plants for the facility’s own bee hives, the number of cuttings of meadows has been reduced to one mowing per year. In 2017|18, AGRANA also installed a falcon nest at this location. This led to the introduction of a falcon, which not only contributes to species conservation but is also intended to deter pigeons and thus help protect the production facilities.
EcoVadis
In summer 2017, AGRANA Stärke GmbH updated its sustainability data (first provided in 2014) for the purposes of EcoVadis, the international supplier evaluation plat- form. AGRANA Stärke GmbH again achieved a gold rating, putting it in the top 5% of performers scored by EcoVadis.

         Revenue in the fruit preparations business rose by just under 2%, as a result partly of higher sales volume. Detracting from the revenue growth were foreign currency effects in individual countries, particularly in Argentina, China, Egypt, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine and the USA.
Revenue increased in all AGRANA regions with the exception of North America and India/Middle East/ Africa (IMEA). In the Eastern Europe region as well (Russia and Ukraine), the business performance remained positive despite the challenging political environment. In the EU, the most important region in revenue terms, AGRANA also succeeded in selling higher volumes, despite the market contraction.
The diversification in fruit preparations towards an increased focus on the customer segments of food service, bakery and ice-cream continued and sales quantities in these areas rose.
AGRANA further improved its market position through gains in market share paralleling the growth of its global key accounts, with long-term customer contracts securing this positive evolution. As well, opportunities for sustained future growth lie in the non-dairy product areas (for instance, fruit preparations for global convenience food chains, and ice-cream components for global brands).

4 Average number of full-time equivalents in the reporting period.

Operating profit (EBIT) in the fruit preparations business increased in every region except IMEA. Significant EBIT improvements were achieved especially in the Europe, Latin America and Asia/Australia regions.
In 2017|18 the integration of the Argentine company Main Process S.A. was completed and the fruit preparations production in Argentina was concentrated at the new site. The company in India newly founded in the prior year recently launched sales of purees; its production of fruit preparations had not yet begun at the balance sheet date.
In July 2017, AGRANA Fruit (Jiangsu) Company Limited, Changzhou, was founded as a new company in the south of China in the Shanghai region; here, construction began in the third quarter of 2017|18 on a new plant that is to open in November 2018.
Revenue in the fruit juice concentrate business was down slightly in 2017|18 compared to the year before. This was a result mainly of lower concentrate prices for product from the 2016 crop compared to 2015. AUSTRIA JUICE operates globally, with the EU as its core market. Other major geographic markets are North America, Russia, the Middle East and Far East. The apple juice concentrate made at the Chinese plant is marketed largely in Japan, the USA, Russia and Australia, as well as Europe.
In the 2017 apple campaign AUSTRIA JUICE saw a significant increase both in raw material prices and the market prices of its products. This was a consequence of significantly limited availability of raw materials in the wake of regional spring frost damage.
EBIT in the fruit juice concentrate activities was hurt by the reduced utilisation of the European production plants, above all in Poland and Hungary. Due to a historic poor apple crop in Europe, only about 50% of capacity was able to be utilised.
Market environment
As estimated by Euromonitor, the global market for spoonable fruit yoghurts (which is relevant to the fruit preparations business) is to grow at an average annual rate of 0.6% to 2021. The markets in the Western Europe and North America regions are predicted to stagnate, while positive sales volume trends are seen in Asia-Pacific and some parts of Africa. The category of drinkable yoghurts is projected to have significantly higher average
annual growth of 7.4% over the same period. In the bakery and ice-cream sectors as well, the global market is forecast to grow overall.
Current product trends for all categories named above include new and recent products based on fancy recipes in order to offer consumers an extraordinary taste experience. Especially in the dessert segment, premium products with several layers (including fruit) or inclusions are popular and in growing demand.
Trends towards more plant-based dairy alternatives con- tinue, and in a once purely soy-dominated market, other plant bases are increasingly gaining ground, such as almond, coconut, lupine and rice. The movement towards milk alternatives derived from plants is a trend not just in yoghurts but also in ice-creams and desserts.
In the development of new products the theme of natural- ness is an important one, addressed through locally inspired flavours or seasonal products. A major dimension which complements the naturalness trend is that of clean label, which centres on achieving a list of ingredients
as short and simple as possible. This trend is already very prominent in Europe and North America in particular, but in other regions such products are also increasingly in demand. Products rich in protein, or with added seeds or cereals, and fruit yoghurts with a reduced sugar content are also in vogue. In the drinkable yoghurt segment, besides kefir, the addition of exotic ingredients such as turmeric is currently popular.
The concentrate business remains marked by the trends both towards lower fruit content in beverages and towards not-from-concentrate 100% juices. There is rising demand for beverage bases with a reduced fruit juice content. Sales of apple juice concentrate for the production of cider remain stable and cider consumption is growing globally.
Prices in Europe for apple juice concentrate had stabilised at a solid level in the first half of 2017|18 as a result
of a rise in demand coinciding with limited quantities of supply in the main growing regions. The low crop volumes in the major apple production regions Poland, Hungary, Germany and Italy caused the prices of concentrate from the 2017 apple campaign to rise significantly from the prior year.
Apple juice concentrate from China showed only a mildly rising price trend year-on-year, leading to an increase in demand for Chinese product in Europe.

Raw materials and production
In the fruit preparations business about 560,000 tonnes of product were manufactured and sold in 2017|18. Compared to the prior year, almost 5% more raw materials were processed. Fruit prices remained stable overall relative to the prior year.
In terms of processed volume, strawberry was the leading fruit, with the supply for the European and Eastern European market coming mainly from Southern Europe, North Africa and Poland, while strawberry for the US market was sourced mainly in Mexico and Egypt. China, Korea and Australia were supplied largely with Chinese product. Across all regions, the processing volume and purchasing prices for strawberry were at the year-earlier levels.
The second most important fruit by processing volume was peach, of which approximately 11% more was processed than in the prior year. The most competitive procurement markets for peaches are Greece and Spain, followed by China. As the harvests were predominantly very good, prices were significantly lower than in the year before.
Blueberry, the third most important fruit in the 2017|18 financial year, had a processing volume
in line with the prior year, but was about 50% more expensive in Europe as a result of small harvests. In all other procurement regions, such as the USA and Canada, prices increased in the course of the year from an initially good level during the harvest.
The purchasing prices for other ingredients were stable. In countries like Russia, Turkey and Egypt, weak local currencies were advantageous for procurement.
In the fruit juice concentrate business, available supplies of apples in the foremost European process- ing regions (Poland and Hungary) were significantly below levels of the year before. Local frosts, especially in Poland, Europe’s largest apple producer, led to the poorest European apple crop in the past ten years. The capacity utilisation rate of the European fruit juice concentrate plants in the 2017 campaign was thus only about 50%. In China the production season was very satisfactory.
The berry processing season was on the whole marked by normal available volumes of the principal fruits, with the exception of sour cherry. The prices for the most important raw materials (strawberry, sour cherry and black currant, though not raspberry) were up from the prior year.
Engagement in the upstream value chain
Supplier environmental and social assessment
In the 2017|18 financial year the Fruit segment continued to advance the implementation of the AGRANA principles for the procurement of agricultural raw materials and intermediate products.
AGRANA Fruit Services GmbH (AFS), Vienna, the purchasing organisation responsible for the procure- ment of raw materials and intermediate products in the fruit preparations business, for the 2017|18 financial year again documented the certification status of primary processors and resellers of fruits and intermediate products under defined sustainability standards (see procurement models from page 38). In the year under review, 13.7% of the raw materials procured by AFS had a sustainability
Group management report
      74

 certification; most of these were certified organic, and
the remainder were certified under another customer standard of industry-wide relevance or under the Rainforest Alliance (RA) standard. The RA standard and
the customer-specific standard are accorded silver status in the benchmarking to the requirements of the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) of the Sustainable Agri- culture Initiative (SAI). As organic standards focus exclusive- ly on agricultural practices and do not touch upon social topics such as worker safety, human rights, etc., organic certification alone is not enough to achieve a sufficiently high score in the SAI benchmarking. The situation is similar for GlobalGAP certification; however, the so-called GRASP add-on module to GlobalGAP also covers social sustainability aspects. In the future, this add-on will also be available for the organic sector (for details on the
FSA assessment, see page 44). Until then, for interested customers, raw materials are also procured with organic and fair trade certification, entitling them to claim
SAI silver status. To also evaluate its suppliers for their adherence to social aspects, AFS invites new suppliers
to participate in the Supplier Ethical Exchange Database, or SEDEX (for details on SEDEX, see page 47). In the 2017|18 financial year, suppliers representing 81.7% of the procurement volume of AFS were already SEDEX mem- bers. For suppliers representing 61.3% of its procurement volume, AFS can view the suppliers’ self-assessments and existing audit documents and use them for supplier evaluation.
In 2017|18 the project (supported by the Austrian Develop- ment Agency since 2014) for the improvement of social and environmental standards with contract farmers in the South Pacific island nation of Fiji was continued. In Fiji, since 2014, AGRANA supports small farmers by acting as the holder of a group certification for bananas, guavas and mangoes under the internationally recognised Australian Certified Organic standard (ACO). Since 2016 the AGRANA plant also processes passion fruit, albeit not yet in an organic grade. In the course of the project, the number of certified farmers was increased by 255 operations; additionally, 50 farms are in the process of conversion to organic methods and will soon receive their organic certification. In the year under review, most new partici- pants recruited to the project were young, well-motivated farmers with a high willingness to acquire the necessary expertise through training and to invest in their farms. The aftermath of Cyclone Winston, which raged across Fiji
in February 2016, remained a reality throughout the 2017|18 financial year. Nearly a full year’s banana harvest was lost, and as a result of the high demand for fresh product on the domestic market, very little banana was available for puree production. The propagation of virus- free planting stock (banana and pineapple) in the local AGRANA-owned organic laboratory was launched as planned, and was all the more important in view of the storm damage. At the end of 2017, ten thousand seedlings were already distributed to the contract farmers for planting. The development project, which was conceived to run for three years, was completed in October 2017; the intensive collaboration with the organic farmers and the production of organic fruit purees continue.
As all procurement for custom recipes in the fruit prepa- rations business is done to customer specifications,
the future trend in the volume of certified raw materials will depend on these customer requirements.
The fruit juice concentrate business, as a result of its procurement structures, is confronted with an especially significant challenge in supply chain management, as most of the raw materials it processes are sourced from dealers. This is a consequence of legacy structures evolved nationally over time which are focused primarily on the fresh market and retail trade and on fruit exports. Fundamentally, the Group would like to purchase more raw materials directly from farmers in the future.
AUSTRIA JUICE currently maintains two projects for
direct procurement from growers. In Hungary, since the year 2000, AUSTRIA JUICE has supported local farmers in growing pest-resistant apple varieties that require about 60% to 80% less pesticide than conventional cultivars. Besides financial assistance for the new planting of the trees and ongoing advice over the growing season,
the fruit growers also receive purchasing guarantees and a price premium from AUSTRIA JUICE. A further project with contract growers was begun in Poland in 2007. In the financial year about 11% of all apples processed by AUSTRIA JUICE into apple juice concentrate worldwide came from these two projects.

Group management report
 In contract crop production, for the documenting of sus- tainable environmental and social criteria at its suppliers’ operations, AUSTRIA JUICE uses the Farm Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative
(for details, see the section “Non-financial information statement under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code”, page 44). The financial year was the first in which Hungarian suppliers of disease- and pest-resistant apple varieties, who were selected according to SAI standards, also participated in the mandatory FSA self-assessment and the external audits. As a result, AUSTRIA JUICE is entitled under SAI standards to claim silver (and in some cases gold) status for the majority of Hungarian growers of resistant varieties. The minimum requirements are met by all Hungarian contract growers of resistant varieties; areas of potential for improvement are addressed through training events. In the 2018|19 financial year the FSA questionnaire and external verification are also to
be used with the contract apple farmers in Poland.
Environmental and energy topics
in AGRANA’s production operations
Energy consumption and emissions in processing
The average specific direct energy consumption per tonne of product (both core and by-products) in the Fruit segment declined by about 13.4% in 2017|18 compared
to the prior year. This reduction was driven by both of the segment’s businesses, fruit preparations and fruit juice concentrates.
Average specific indirect energy consumption in the Fruit segment as a whole rose by about 5.9% from one year earlier. This increase also occurred in both business activities.
On balance, the average specific emissions from direct and indirect energy consumption per tonne of product fell by 12.7% from the prior year, thanks partly to the greater use of renewable energy in the fruit preparations business (reflecting especially the fact that the fruit preparations site of Main Process S.A. in Argentina was included for the first time).

Water use and discharge in processing
The average specific consumption of water in the Fruit segment increased by about 2.7% in the financial year. This resulted from higher water use in the fruit preparations business, especially at the site of Main Process S.A. in Argentina, which was included in the sustainability data for the first time. The average specific amount of water discharge, by contrast, eased by 1.1% as a higher discharge in the fruit preparations activities was more than offset by lower discharge on the fruit juice concentrates side.

Waste from processing
The increase in the specific waste amount in the Fruit segment from 26.5 kilogrammes per tonne of product (core and by-products) in the prior year to 38.5 kilogrammes in 2017|18 was attributable to both business areas. The reported rise in the amount of hazardous waste resulted only from a broadening of the definition of hazardous waste at the fruit preparations site in Russia.

Biodiversity at production sites
The fruit juice concentrate business at its headquarters in Kröllendorf/Allhartsberg, Austria, as part of its biodiversity activities, supports a project of the “Forum for Nature
and Species Conservation” aimed at the reintroduction of the little owl. This species, one of the smallest of the
owls, is considered endangered as a breeding population in Austria. For its survival it needs a fine-structured land- scape (ideally including orchard meadows) with cavity trees in a rural setting – conditions that are common near this AGRANA site.
EcoVadis
In the 2017|18 financial year, AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH updated its sustainability data for the purposes of EcoVadis, the international supplier evaluation platform. It moved up from an initial silver status to a rating of gold, putting it in the top 5% of performers scored by EcoVadis.
Investment
The capital expenditure of € 49.4 million in the Fruit segment in 2017|18 (prior year: € 33.8 million) represented capacity expansion and plant modernisation projects, among others. It encompassed various projects across all 42 production sites, prominent examples being the construction start of the second fruit preparations plant in China and a new carrot concentrate production line in Hungary.

Research and development
In a highly competitive marketplace, it is crucially important for AGRANA to identify market trends, satisfy the markets’ needs through product innovations and develop customised solutions for
its clientele. In close partnership with customers, AGRANA’s research and development (R&D) teams are always working on new technologies, specialty products and innovative applications for existing products, thus supporting the Group’s strategic focus on lasting success.
The AGRANA Research & Innovation Center (ARIC) in Tulln, Austria, is the Group’s central research and development hub for the Sugar, Starch and Fruit businesses, and works together with AGRANA’s 16 local NPD1 centres. A key goal of ARIC, which is structured as a separate company wholly owned
by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG, is to develop innovative products from sugar beets, potatoes, corn (maize), waxy corn, wheat and fruits. ARIC is active nationally and internationally as an in-house R&D service provider for sugar technology, food technology, starch technology, microbiology, biotechnology and fruit preparations development. The research center also offers its specialist R&D know-how to third parties and acts as a government-accredited laboratory for sugar beet quality control.
The collaboration of R&D specialists from the different segments (Sugar, Starch and Fruit) under one roof not only drives administrative synergies but also promotes a creative exchange between different groups of researchers, particularly on subjects that cut across segment boundaries. The complemen- tarity between the groups’ experience is particularly valuable in cross-segment areas of research, such as technologies, thickeners and aromas, microbiology, product quality and safety, and organic products.

   The systematic selection of sugar beet varieties for the further optimisation of sugar production
is becoming increasingly important especially in growing regions with a higher risk of pest damage, crop disease and drought. Besides selecting varieties with a high tolerance to such stressors,
a high degree of “storage stability” (a long storage life) of the beet is a decisive factor in ensuring the viability of factory locations in the long term, as this stability in storage is the prerequisite for extending the processing period.
While the storability of beet is also affected by the amount of soil clinging to it, the degree of injury and the storage temperature, a critical determining factor is the genetic make-up of the beet varieties used. In a project supported by Austria’s Research Promotion Agency (Forschungsförderungsgesell- schaft, FFG) and conducted jointly with the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) and other partners, work is underway to characterise the genetic material and thus allow the identification of suitable varieties to be greatly accelerated.
Technology
A major research priority remains the optimisation of yield in sugar extraction. In the extraction
area of the individual sugar factories, according to whether they have a beet pulp drying facility or not, R&D staff is at work to adjust the – desirable – controlled microbial activity so as to achieve
an optimal balance between minimising sugar losses to bacteria and allowing enough microbial action to optimise the processability of the spent beet pulp. In addition to establishing the use of automated analysers for the monitoring of microbiological activity, AGRANA stepped up its continual efforts to optimise disinfection measures in the sugar plants.

As a result of new recommendations in spring 2017 from the European Commission for controlling the nitrite
and nitrate content in animal feed raw materials produced by the sugar industry, the European Food Safety Authority was tasked with evaluating these guidelines in terms of animal health aspects.
By-products
Yield fluctuations in the production of beverage alcohol prompted a detailed investigation of the fermentability of molasses. In the laboratory the underlying variations in the fermentability of molasses from different origins were confirmed. Based on extensive analytical study, a process was developed to level out these variations in molasses quality as far as possible and ensure a constant yield in beverage alcohol production.
The by-products of sugar production, such as molasses residue and pressed beet pulp, are currently utilised as feedstuffs. Together with the Department of Agrobiotech- nology (Tulln campus) of Vienna’s University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences and three external companies, a project supported by the FFG was launched to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from molasses residue and pressed beet pulp. PHAs are building
blocks for the manufacture of a wide range of bioplastics on a sustainable basis.
Starch segment
Raw materials
The effect of advanced degrees of ripeness of Austrian- grown varieties of corn and waxy corn on starch proper- ties was studied in systematic tests. The study found
that the starch attributes, such as chemical modifiability, correlate with the stage of ripeness. As these results are very dependent on factors like weather and site quality, the study must be expanded to more planting sites and especially to several growing seasons. The insights gained are to be used in raw material management.
Food applications
Naturalness, clean label, GMO-free and organic grades are trends in the food industry that have become very important to many consumers. Manufacturers must there- fore find and develop new raw materials, new technolo- gies and new applications that address this demand. Thus, at AGRANA, technologies were developed that permit the production of starches with properties previously achiev- able only by chemical modification. The optimisation
and adjustment of treatment methods makes it possible to use starches that can be labelled as additive-free.
Given the growth in the number of consumers choosing
a vegetarian or vegan diet, and the rising demand for allergen-free products and health-promoting ingredients, product development teams in particular are working hard to accommodate these trends. For instance, AGRANA developed and successfully established plant-based products on the market that permit the replacement of whole egg in a wide range of applications and that
can also be substituted for gelatin in products like gums and jellies. Another important area of development is the creation of food ingredients with properties conducive
to gut health, such as soluble and insoluble dietary fibre.
Non-food applications
The subject of sustainability and the continual rise
in environmental consciousness also defined the develop- ment of new products and optimisation of processes in starches for non-food use.
At the forefront of the research and development efforts were new thermoplastic starches for use in biodegrad- able bioplastics. In collaboration with external scientific partners, the product portfolio of modified starches was expanded. Under the name Amitroplast®, a product group has been created that fully answers the needs of the market for sustainable, biodegradable blown films. The development work resulted in novel starch products for different film types that enable better processing on the blown film line. It generated environmental value-added, raising the sustainable content in packaging without a loss of quality to the customer.

Another focus of development was process optimisation for the existing product range to achieve more frugal
use of raw materials and energy resources. Technical inno- vations and new insights in the process control of starch derivatization permitted savings in the consumption
of chemicals and energy. This made starch product manu- facturing significantly more efficient. These technical
and technological adjustments not only improved process stability but were also positive for the utilisation of pro- duction capacity.
Bioethanol
In the bioethanol activities, the evaluation of new enzymes and yeasts for their impact on the efficiency and profit- ability of the production process remained a priority. Through permanent improvements in process conditions and fermentation control, the yield of bioethanol was further optimised.
Fruit segment
Fruit treatment
The results from the prior year regarding a new tech- nology for the microbial inactivation of fruit were further refined through continued industrial-scale trials. The
use of the new technology resulted in residue-free raw material with significantly reduced microbial activity. The fruits treated by this method can be further processed more gently than would otherwise be possible, which permits an improvement in the organoleptic properties of fruit preparations.
Another research focus was on improving the preserva- tion of fruit texture during processing. Going forward, the technology involved will be used to safeguard constant product quality during the entire harvest and processing. It is also employed in products where greater visual recog- nition of the fruit (as distinct individual pieces) is desired.
In partnership with Vienna University of Technology, modelling in computational fluid dynamics furthered the understanding of best-practice facility design for the production of fruit preparations, which will ultimately lead to a reduction in thermal and mechanical stresses on
the fruit. The planned implementation at industrial scale is expected to result in both increased productivity and lower energy consumption.
Product development
Consistent with the trend towards greater naturalness in fruit preparations, stabiliser-free concepts were developed and the use of new technologies led to a reduction in manufacturing time. As well, mango, apple, pear and fig were successfully used in mixtures with other raw materials.
R&D also developed concepts based on various natural sweeteners.
Fruit juice concentrates
In 2017|18 in the fruit juice concentrate business, the product categories of beverage bases and aromas were successfully expanded further. For these development areas, strategic investments were made in infrastructure and human resources. Among other milestones,
the expansion of the R&D and analytics departments was completed and brought into service.
The in-house production of composite aromas continued to be further developed in order to build up the growth segment of beverage bases and the aroma business.

In the Sugar segment the employee count remained steady relative to the prior year. Meanwhile
in the Starch segment, the expansion of the corn starch plant in Aschach, Austria, and of wheat starch production in the combined wheat starch and bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, led to an increase in staff numbers. In the Fruit segment, the number of employees (in full-time equivalents) was down slightly from one year earlier. This was due primarily to a decrease at the fruit preparations site in Coronda, Argentina, which outweighed the addition of personnel at the new company in India. Other, volume-related rises and falls in local staff levels had no impact on the average number of FTE.
The average age of permanent employees3 on 28 February 2018 was 42 years, as in the prior year (for details of the age structure, see the GRI content index, page 182). Of the permanent employees, 29.3% (prior year: 29.4%) were women, and 56.7% of salaried staff held an academic degree (prior year: 57.1%). The turnover rate for permanent staff in 2017|18 was 12.6% (prior year: 11.5%). The proportion of employees with a part-time contract was 3.1%.
Human resources management
Dedication, entrepreneurial thinking and action, and employee development are the cornerstones of AGRANA’s personnel strategy. Likewise, mutual respect, social consciousness and sustainable business form essential elements of the corporate culture. Diversity too is embraced as a day-to-day practice at AGRANA, which is especially evident in the collaboration of its international business units.

 AGRANA’s people
 AGRANA promotes the potential of its people. Only through the long-tern development of its people can AGRANA ensure its continuing strength as a competitor in the marketplace. Training and development programmes thus continued to be a high priority last year.
As a global company, AGRANA also makes a point of main- taining a high standard of quality in its human resources activities and seeks to continually enhance them further. Thus, a number of initiatives were launched in the 2017|18 financial year, including preparatory work for the future implementation of a global human resource management system.
Variable compensation
The incentivising and recognition of performance is a major element of the personnel strategy and a significant factor for the Group’s success. To help achieve the company’s strategic and operational objectives, a Group- wide performance management system is in place for managerial staff. Next to targets related to the corporate financial position and profit, the variable compensation plan also involves personal targets to encourage and honour outstanding individual performance. In the 2017|18 financial year, 8.5% of all employees (prior year: 8.5%) were covered by this performance-related compensation system.
Multiple awards for AGRANA HR team
AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG again placed third in 2017|18 in the BEST RECRUITERS sector ranking for the Austrian food industry and again numbered among the top 100 recruiters in the overall ranking.
BEST RECRUITERS is the largest recruiting study in
the German-speaking countries. It annually reviews the quality of recruiting practices of the top employers in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The study considers more than 130 scientific criteria in assessing job advertisements, recruiting presence and the treat- ment of applicants.
The awarding of the BEST RECRUITERS mark attests to the fact that AGRANA attaches great importance to the respect- ful and friendly treatment of potential new employees. The Group sees this recognition as an affirmation of its efforts to continually refine the quality standards it applies to the process of searching for new talent, and takes it as motivation to adopt promising new recruiting trends.
In Slovakia the HR team of Slovenské Cukrovary s.r.o. won distinction as “Leading HR Organisation of 2017” in the manufacturing sector. The field of contestants for this award includes most of the leading companies in Slovakia, and the ranking is based solely on the evaluation of about 100 HR performance indicators.
AGRANA subsidiary Magyar Cukor Zrt. was honoured as “Employer of the Year in 2017” in Hungary.
Staff development and training
AGRANA systematically supports the steady improvement of its employees’ knowledge and the development of their skills. Besides many job skills trainings and personal development offerings, intensive Group-wide programmes were also available. These training courses not only

 improve the Group’s competitiveness but also help raise employee motivation and self-esteem. Every employee matters to AGRANA, and appropriate development oppor- tunities are therefore offered for all levels of staff.
The top training priorities in 2017|18 remained manage- ment development and the development of trainings for subject experts in some selected functional areas. In the year under review, AGRANA provided training to a total of 75 apprentices (the average number for the year) in Austria, Germany, France, Slovakia and Brazil in prepara- tion for careers as, among others, mechanical engineering technicians, electrical engineering technicians, plant electricians and process control technicians, metalworking technicians, chemical lab technicians, food technicians, mechatronics technicians, industrial sales representatives and computer technicians.
As well, two international trainee programmes in the areas of purchasing and production were successfully implemented. For these, AGRANA received the TraineeNet Award 2017 for “true and fair trainee programmes” in
July 2017. The certification process reviewed whether AGRANA’s trainee programmes meet the defined require- ments (academic degree, job rotation, fair salary, and talent development) for such a programme. The AGRANA trainee programmes are the result of intensive design work and include internal mentoring by AGRANA mentors, project work, job rotations within the AGRANA Group, and intensive training modules.
Workplace safety data for the AGRANA Group1
In the 2017|18 financial year, 25 members of staff
and managers from across the Group continued the fifth iteration of the international AGRANA Competencies Training (ACT) programme for prospective new managers. ACT is designed for individuals seen as having high potential, excellent performance and exceptional motiva- tion. In January 2018 the participants completed the
ACT V curriculum. Following their graduation from the programme, the junior managers were given the oppor- tunity, as a new initiative, to have access to an AGRANA mentor at the senior management level for their further in-house development.
AGRANA-wide onboarding programmes and welcome
days are conducted on an on-going basis to give new staff
a comprehensive view of the Group as a whole and of their own area of activity. Employees gain perspective and understanding as a result. They are also able to participate in Group-wide exchanges known as INCA, or International Communication at AGRANA. AGRANA values harmonious working relationships, and team-building activities
help improve communication and effectiveness in working together in the various departments.
The Group’s expenditure for external training and develop- ment in the 2017|18 financial year was about € 2.9 million (prior year: € 2.6 million), equivalent to 1.2% (prior year: 1.2%) of total wages and salaries.

 AGRANA’s people
 Workplace health and safety
For AGRANA as a manufacturing company, nothing is more important than workplace safety. To facilitate the comparability and analysis of workplace accidents
and enable informed corrective action, AGRANA collects fully standardised worldwide health and safety data.
Health programmes
Under the AGRANA Fit programme, with the goal of maintaining and improving employees’ health and well- ness, AGRANA in many locations offers preventive health checkups and/or vaccinations (for influenza, tick-borne encephalitis, etc.) as part of the routine occupational health services. As well, some locations have individual arrangements with local fitness facilities and health care organisations.
AGRANA provides a broad sports offering for its employees, such as ski days, in-house football tournaments, bowling, American football, walking groups, bouldering, fitness boxing, Nordic walking, and yoga, Pilates and boot camp courses.
In September 2017, as every year, AGRANA staff partici- pated in force in the Wien Energie Business Run. The 56 teams of three persons each that were fielded by the company came from all of its business areas.
Alongside numerous health and sports offerings, the Group locations provided many other related opportunities, such as workshops for employee information, sensitisation
Workplace safety targets for the AGRANA Group1
in the 2017|18 and 2018|19 financial years
and continuing development in the areas of work-life balance management, stress reduction, burnout preven- tion, and for the right ergonomics in the workplace.
Healthful nutrition is a major element of personal well- being, and AGRANA thus also raises its own employees’ awareness of the importance of balanced and healthy eating and drinking. Besides holding workshops, this is done through local initiatives such as making free fresh fruit available at work on a self-serve basis. AGRANA Fruit US was again recognised in the year under review as a Gold-Level Fit-Friendly Worksite by the American Heart Association for its work in this sphere.
Balancing work and family
Harmonising the demands of work and family is import- ant from a social sustainability perspective and plays a prominent role in AGRANA’s human resources strategy.
For this reason, AGRANA joined the “Business for Family” network of the Federal Ministry for Family and Youth back in spring 2016.
Across the Group, this is reflected in several initiatives and offerings for employees. Teleworking, support for and even the direct provision of child care (including special such services during the holidays), variable working hours, and a parent-child office at the Vienna headquarters
are all part of this effort. In addition, employees’ families are included in a number of events, group meals and sports activities (also see the corporate governance report, page 29).

Risk management
and system of internal control
The Management Board of the AGRANA Group recognises the importance of active risk management. The basic aim of risk management at AGRANA is to identify risks and opportunities as early as possible and take appropriate measures to safeguard the profitability and continued existence of the Group.
The AGRANA Group uses integrated monitoring and reporting systems that permit regular, Group- wide assessment of the risk situation. For the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the Group, two mutually complementary control tools are in place:
█ An enterprise-wide operational planning and reporting system forms the basis for the monthly reporting to the appropriate decision-makers. Under this reporting process, a separate risk report is prepared for the Group and for each business segment. Its focus is on the determination of sensitivities to changing market prices for the current and next financial year. The individual risk parameters are assessed on an ongoing basis in relation to the current budget (prepared at the start of the year) or the current forecast (as updated in the course of the year), so as to be able to calculate the impacts on the profit measure “operating profit before exceptional items and results of equity-accounted joint ventures”. Besides these ongoing reports, the business situation and the use of risk mitigation measures are regularly discussed by the risk managers from the business areas directly with the Management Board.
█ The strategic risk management aims to identify material individual risks and evaluate their implications for the overall profile of risks and opportunities. Twice every year, the medium- to long-term risks in the individual business areas are analysed by a designated risk manage-
ment team together with the Group’s central risk management function. The process involves risk identification and risk assessment by probability of occurrence and potential magnitude of risk/opportunity, the definition of early warning indicators and the taking of countermeasures. Also, the aggregate risk position of the AGRANA Group is determined for the current financial year using a Monte Carlo simulation (which is an established standard calculation in risk management). This allows a judgement to be made as to whether a combination or accumulation of individual risks could pose a threat to the ability to continue in business as a going concern. The results are reported to the Management Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
Risk management representatives have been designated for the business segments of the AGRANA Group. These representatives are responsible for initiating loss-minimising measures as required, subject to Management Board approval.
The design and implementation of risk management under rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance is evaluated annually by the independent audit firm, which submits the findings in a final report on the viability of the Group-wide risk management. The evaluation uses the recommendations of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as the reference model against which to compare AGRANA’s risk management.
Risk policy
AGRANA sees the responsible management of business opportunities and risks as an essential basis for purposeful, value-driven and sustainable business management. The Group’s risk policy seeks to ensure risk-aware behaviour, sets out clearly defined responsibilities and stipulates independent risk control as well as integrated internal controls.
Throughout the Group, risks may be assumed only if they arise from the core business of the AGRANA Group and if it does not make economic sense to avoid, insure or hedge them. The policy is to minimise risks to the extent reasonably possible while achieving an appropriate balance of risks and returns. The assumption of risks outside the operating business is prohibited without exception.
 86

AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG is responsible for the Group- wide coordination and implementation of risk manage- ment arrangements determined by the Management Board. The use of hedging instruments is permitted only to hedge operating business transactions and financing activities, not for speculative purposes. The positions
in hedge contracts and their current value are regularly reported to the Management Board.
Significant risks and uncertainties
The AGRANA Group is exposed to risks both from its busi- ness operations and from its national and international operating environment.
Operational risks
Procurement risks
AGRANA is dependent on the availability of sufficient amounts of agricultural raw materials of the necessary quality. Beyond a possible supply shortfall of appropriate raw materials, a risk is also posed by fluctuation in the prices of these inputs (to the extent that the difference cannot be passed through to customers). Major drivers of availability, quality and price are weather conditions in the growing regions, the competitive situation, regulatory and legal requirements, and movements in the exchange rates of relevant currencies.
In the Sugar segment, sugar beet and raw sugar are used as raw materials. Besides weather factors, an important determinant of sugar beet availability is how profitable
it is for farmers to grow beet rather than other field crops. The availability of sugar beet is gaining additional impor- tance as a result of the changed market situation in Europe since 1 October 2017 (also see the section “Risks from sugar market regulation” below), as beet prices are increas- ingly determined by the price of sugar. For the refining facilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Romania, the basic driver of AGRANA’s profitability is how much value can be added by processing the purchased raw sugar, given the market prices achievable for white sugar. Next to the risk of high raw sugar purchasing prices, another procurement risk lies in the regulations on the import of white and raw sugar into the European Union. The prices for the required raw sugar are hedged with commodity derivatives where financially appropriate. Additionally, exports of white sugar and contracts with industrial cus- tomers are hedged using commodity derivatives. Hedging is performed in accordance with internal policies and must be reported to the Management Board.
In the Starch segment, sufficient supply contracts are concluded to secure the required quantities of raw materials. When economical, the hedging can also take the form of futures contracts and over-the-counter derivatives, both of which require management approval. The volume and results of these hedges are included
in the monthly reporting and are reported to AGRANA’s Management Board. Thanks to the utilisation of national and international procurement markets, the availability of raw materials can largely be regarded as assured.
For specialty grades and varieties, the required volumes are also secured through contract farming.
In bioethanol production, when prices change for the grains used as input materials, the selling price of
the co-product ActiProt® generally changes in the same direction. This acts as a natural hedge by partly offsetting the grain price movements. Selling prices of bioethanol in Europe are driven largely by the quotations on
the Platts information platform, which do not reflect raw material prices but fluctuations in the ethanol market. The volatility in bioethanol prices is correspondingly high.
In the Fruit segment, crop failures caused by unfavourable weather and by plant diseases can adversely affect the availability and purchasing prices of raw materials. In the fruit preparations business, with its worldwide presence and its knowledge of procurement markets, AGRANA is able to anticipate regional supply bottlenecks and price volatility and take appropriate remedial action in response. Also, where possible, one-year contracts are used both with suppliers and customers.
In the fruit juice concentrate business, the risks related
to raw materials, production and sales are managed supraregionally. Both foreign-currency purchases of raw materials and sales contracts in foreign currency are hedged using derivatives. In these derivatives contracts, no short or long positions are taken that exceed the amount necessary for hedging the underlying transaction.
The production processes, especially in the Sugar and Starch segments, are energy-intensive. AGRANA therefore continually invests in improving the energy efficiency of its manufacturing facilities and designs them for the most cost-effective use of different sources of energy. The quantities and prices of the required energy are also to some extent secured, for the short and medium term.

Product quality and safety
AGRANA sees the manufacturing and marketing of high- quality, safe products as a fundamental requirement for long-term economic success. The Group applies rigorous quality management that is continually refined and that meets the requirements of the relevant food and beverage legislation, standards and customer specifications. The quality management covers the entire process from raw material procurement, to manufacturing, to the delivery of the finished product. The compliance with legal and other quality standards is regularly verified by internal and external audits. In addition, product liability insurance is carried to cover any remaining risks.
Market risks and competitive risks
In its worldwide operations, AGRANA is exposed to intense competition from regional and supraregional competitors. The market entry of new competitors or the addition
of more production capacity by existing rivals may intensify competition in the future.
The Group’s own market position is continually monitored so that any required corrective action can be rapidly initi- ated. In response to demand and other factors, AGRANA frequently adjusts its capacity and cost structures in
order to maintain its competitiveness in the core markets. The early detection of changes in demand patterns and consumer behaviour is based on the constant analysis of sales variances. In this context, AGRANA also monitors new technological developments and production processes in the market that, in the future, could lead to a partial backward integration on the part of customers into core businesses of individual segments of the AGRANA Group.
To strengthen existing market positions, AGRANA invests extensively in all its business segments. As well, invest- ments in new markets are evaluated and undertaken. Inten- sive negotiations are currently underway for the acquisition of the Serbian sugar company Sunoko. As well, the construction of a second fruit preparations plant in China is in progress and AGRANA is preparing to manufacture fruit preparations in India. An important upcoming challenge will be to integrate these new activities into the Group organisation as rapidly as possible.
The still unstable political situation between Ukraine and Russia could have a negative impact on the market environment in the Fruit segment. Currently, however, the region continues to show a stable earnings situation.
Regulatory risks
Risks from sugar market regulation
As part of the risk management process, potential scenarios and their impacts are examined and assessed from an early stage. Current developments and their implications are also reported from page 59 of this report, in the section on the Sugar segment.
Sugar regime: Since 1 October 2017 there is no longer
a minimum beet price and the quota system for sugar and isoglucose is abolished. Both of these sweeteners can now be produced and sold in the EU without quantity restric- tions. Even before the end of the quotas in autumn 2017, the anticipation of this change already affected the European sugar market through an expansion of the beet planting area in the 2017|18 sugar marketing year (SMY). As well, high crop yields per hectare in SMY 2017|18 increased the sugar supply in the EU area. With the aboli- tion of the quotas, a partial substitution of isoglucose for granulated sugar is also expected to occur.
The fact that the quota has expired should lead to continu- ing high beet sugar production, especially in prime growing regions. The European market prices are likely
to correlate more closely with prices on the world market, making it possible that sugar prices will show a wide range of fluctuation. The new sugar market rules also do not provide minimum prices for sugar beet. However, beet prices will continue to be negotiated between the beet producers and the beet-using industry. The reform of the sugar regime does not involve a change in the system
of import duties for sugar imports from outside the EU nor in the treatment of imports from LDC/ACP countries (Least Developed Countries and African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States) with preferential EU agreements.
Free trade agreements: The free trade agreements cur- rently being negotiated by the European Union could have economic impacts on AGRANA. The company is following the ongoing trade talks and analysing and evaluating the individual results.
EU Renewable Energy Directive
In September 2015 the EU’s adoption of Directive 2015/1513 amended the EU Renewable Energy Directive. With respect to the EU target of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (from 1990 levels), the rules for the share of biofuels were modified.
Group management report

In November 2016 the European Commission presented a new proposal that calls for a renewable energy share of at least 27% within the EU, but does not set a specific target for the transport sector. The proposal includes
a reduction of biofuels made from agricultural raw materials (“first-generation”, i.e. conventional, biofuels), beginning in 2021, from 7% to a maximum of 3.8% in 2030. Conversely, the use of ethanol produced from straw, wood and waste (“second-generation”) is to be increased incrementally from 1.5% in 2021 to 3% by 2030.
The Council of the European Union reached agreement on 18 December 2017 on its position regarding the Commission’s proposal and will enter into negotiations with the European Parliament on this basis. For the trans- port sector, the Council position seeks a binding target, for every member state, of at least 14% renewable energy by 2030. Renewable fuels from field crops are to be permitted at an unchanged share of up to 7%. The share of biofuels from waste and residues is to increase to
at least 3%.
A changed position on these matters was adopted on
17 January 2018 by the plenary of the European Parliament with proposals for biofuel policy from 2021 to 2030 (RED II). For grain-based fuels it decided that the amount of biofuels produced in 2017 in the member states should represent the maximum reference amount, which would set the maximum share at 7% and thus maintain the status quo. Overall, however, the Parliament seeks to increase the total share of all forms of renewable energy to 12%.
The tripartite negotiations between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission to decide the final form of
the biofuel policy for the period from 2021 have begun. A decision is expected in the 2018 calendar year, possibly as soon as the first half of the year.
It should be noted that the current debate over the appropriate share of biofuels is narrowly focused on the reduction of greenhouse gases. Biofuel advantages that are not being taken into account are the demonstrable reduction in particulate emissions, the production
of GMO-free protein feed and capture of fermentation- derived carbon dioxide as by-products, and the utilisation of surplus grain as a raw material.
AGRANA is following current developments and advocat- ing at the national and European level for a growing share of renewable fuels.
Legal risks
AGRANA continually monitors changes in the legal setting relevant to its businesses or to their employees that could lead to a risk situation, and takes risk management actions as necessary. Areas of law to which particular attention is devoted are antitrust, food and environ- mental legislation, as well as data protection, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism finance provisions. AGRANA maintains dedicated staff positions for matters of compliance, employment law and general areas of law.
There are currently no pending or threatened civil actions against companies of the AGRANA Group that could have
a material impact on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
As noted in previous annual reports, the Austrian Federal Competition Authority in 2010 sought a fine under an antitrust case for alleged competition-restricting arrange- ments with respect to Austria filed against AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, and Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany. To date the Cartel Court has not ruled on the case. AGRANA continues to regard the allegation as unfounded and the fine sought as unwarranted.
Financial risks
AGRANA is subject to risks from movements in exchange rates, interest rates and product prices. It also has exposure to risks related to obtaining the financing required by
the Group from financial institutions and/or the capital market. The Group’s financing management is largely pro- vided centrally by the Treasury department, which regularly reports to the Management Board on the movement in and structure of the Group’s net debt, on financial risks and the amount and results of the hedging positions taken.
The AGRANA Group operates worldwide and must observe different tax regimes, levy requirements and currency regulations. Changes in provisions of the various legislators and their interpretation by local authorities can have an effect on the financial results of individual Group com- panies.
Risk management
89

Interest rate risks
Interest rate risks arise from fluctuation in the value of fixed interest financial instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates; this is referred to as interest rate price risk. By contrast, floating rate investments
or borrowings are subject to minimal price risk, as their interest rate is adjusted to market rates very frequently. However, the fluctuation in market interest rates entails risk as to the amounts of future interest payments;
this is referred to as interest rate cash flow risk. AGRANA strives to employ interest rate hedging instruments
that match the amount and maturity of debt financing. In accordance with IFRS 7, the existing interest rate risks are determined by calculating Cash-Flow-at-Risk and
the modified duration and are presented in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Currency risks
Currency risks arise mainly from the purchase and
sale of goods in foreign currencies and from financing in non-local currencies. For AGRANA, the principal relevant exchange rates are those between the euro and the
US dollar, Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, Romanian leu, Ukrainian hryvnia, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan.
As part of its currency management, AGRANA, on a monthly basis for each Group company, determines the net foreign currency exposure arising from the purchasing, sales, and cash and cash equivalent positions, including the hedging positions held. Open purchasing and sales contracts in foreign currencies that have not yet been settled are also taken into account. For the hedging of currency risks, AGRANA primarily employs forward foreign exchange contracts (also known as currency forwards). Through these, the value of cash flows denominated in foreign currencies is protected against exchange rate movements. In countries with volatile currencies, these risks are further reduced through the shortening of credit periods, indexing of selling prices to the euro or US dollar, and similar methods of risk mitigation.
Currency risk is determined using the Value-at-Risk approach and presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Liquidity risks
Liquidity risks at single-company or country level are detected early through the standardised reporting, thus allowing timely mitigative action to be taken as appro-
priate. The liquidity of the AGRANA Group is sufficiently assured for the long term through bilateral and syndicated credit lines.
Risks of default on receivables
Risks of default on receivables are mitigated by trade credit insurance, strict credit limits, and the ongoing monitoring of customers’ credit quality. The residual risk is covered by raising appropriate amounts of provisions.
The financial risks are explained in detail in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements, in the section “Notes on financial instruments” (from page 143).
Non-financial risks
Both through its business operations and its national
and international operating environment, the AGRANA Group is exposed to non-financial risks and to risks
that are not primarily financial. For example, as a globally operating processor of agricultural raw materials, climatic changes and their impacts on the availability of raw materials pose potential risks for AGRANA. With its energy- intensive production activities, particularly in the Sugar and Starch segments, AGRANA is also subject to risks from energy-related and environmental legislation in the various countries. Not least, compliance with sustainable environmental and social criteria in the upstream supply chain is also increasingly gaining significance from a risk perspective, as non-compliance would involve potential quality and reputational risks.
AGRANA has taken appropriate measures to counteract detrimental effects from non-financial risks associated with strategic and operational business conduct.
These measures relate to environmental, employee and social matters and are in accordance with national
and international standards for the protection of quality and reputation in the interest of the AGRANA Group (see details in the section “Non-financial information statement under section 267a Austrian Commercial Code” from page 41).
Aggregate risk
The Group’s aggregate risk exposure was marked by con- tinuing high volatility in selling prices and raw material purchasing prices, and, on balance, remained the same as in the prior year. At present there are no discernible risks to the AGRANA Group’s ability to continue in business.

System of internal control and of risk management1
The Management Board of AGRANA is responsible for the establishment and design of an internal control system and risk management system in respect of both the accounting process and of compliance with the relevant legal requirements.
The internal control system, standardised Group-wide accounting rules and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) assure both the uniformity of accounting and the reliability of the financial reporting and externally published financial statements.
Most Group companies use SAP as the primary ERP2 system. All AGRANA companies send the data from their separate financial statements to the central SAP consoli- dation module. This ensures that the reporting system operates on the basis of uniform data. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group Accounting department. The department is responsible for ensuring the correct and complete transfer of finan- cial data from Group companies, for carrying out the financial statement consolidation, performing analytical processing of the data and preparing financial reports. On a monthly basis, the Controlling and Group Accounting departments validate and assure the congruence of the internal and external reporting.
The primary control tool for AGRANA’s management
is the enterprise-wide, uniform planning and reporting system. The system comprises a medium-term plan
with a planning horizon of five years, budget planning for the next financial year, monthly reporting including a separate monthly risk report, and, three times per year, a projection for the current financial year that incorporates the significant financial developments. In the event
of material changes in the planning assumptions, this system is supplemented with ad-hoc forecasts.
The monthly financial reporting produced by Controlling portrays the performance of all Group companies. The contents of this report are standardised across the Group and include detailed sales data, the balance sheet, income statement and the financials derived from them, as well
as an analysis of significant variances. This monthly report also includes a dedicated risk report both for each busi- ness segment and the whole AGRANA Group, calculating the risk potential for the current and next financial year for the key profitability factors, based on the assumption of current market prices for not yet contractually secured volumes versus budgeted prices.
A Group-wide risk management system (see “Risk manage- ment” section from page 86) at both the operational
and strategic level in which all sources and types of risk relevant to AGRANA – such as the regulatory and legal environment, raw material procurement, competitive and market risks, and financing – are analysed for risks and opportunities, enables the management to identify changes in the Group’s environment at an early stage and to take timely corrective action as required.
Internal Audit monitors all operational and business processes in the Group for compliance with legal provisions and internal policies and procedures, and for the effectiveness of risk management and the systems
of internal control. The unit’s audit activities are guided by an annual audit plan, which is based on a Group-wide risk assessment and approved by the Management Board. When requested by the Management Board, Internal Audit also performs ad-hoc audits focusing on current and future risks. The audit findings are regularly reported to AGRANA’s Management Board and the respective managers responsible as well as the Supervisory Board (represented by the Audit Committee). The implementa- tion of the actions proposed by Internal Audit is assured by follow-up verifications.
As part of the audit of the financial statements, the external independent auditor annually evaluates the inter- nal control system of the accounting process and of the information technology systems. The audit findings are reported to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

Capital, shares, voting rights and rights of control1
The share capital of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG at the balance sheet date of 28 February 2018 was
€ 113.5 million (28 February 2017: € 113.5 million), divided into 15,622,244 voting ordinary no-par value bearer shares (28 February 2017: 15,622,244 such shares). There are no other classes of shares.
Z&S Zucker und Stärke Holding AG (“Z&S”), based in Vienna, is the majority shareholder, directly holding 78.34% of the share capital of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Z&S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGRANA Zucker, Stärke und Frucht Holding AG, Vienna. In this latter company, Zucker-Beteiligungs- gesellschaft m.b.H. (“ZBG”), Vienna, in turn holds 50% less one share (that share being held by AGRANA Zucker GmbH, a subsidiary of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG) and Südzucker AG (“Südzucker”), Mannheim, Germany, holds the other 50%. The following five Vienna-based entities are shareholders of ZBG: „ALMARA“ Holding GmbH (a subsidiary of RAIFFEISEN-HOLDING NIEDERÖSTERREICH- WIEN registrierte Genossenschaft mit beschränkter Haftung); Marchfelder Zuckerfabriken Gesell- schaft m.b.H.; Estezet Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H.; Rübenproduzenten Beteiligungs GesmbH; and Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest Beteiligungs AG. Under a syndicate agreement between Südzucker and ZBG, the voting rights of the syndicate partners are combined in Z&S, there are restrictions on the transfer of shares, and the partners in the syndicate have certain mutual rights to appoint members of each other’s management board and supervisory board. Thus, Johann Marihart has been nominated by ZBG and appointed as a member of the management board of Südzucker AG, and Thomas Kölbl has been nominated by Südzucker and appointed as a member of the management board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG.
The Management Board is authorised until including 4 September 2020 to increase the share capital, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, by up to € 4,940,270.20 by issuing up to 679,796 new ordinary bearer shares of the Company against payment in cash or contributions in kind, in one or more tranches, and to determine, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, the issue amount (which shall not be less than the proportionate amount of the share capital), the terms of the issue and the other details of the implementation of the capital increase.
There are no shareholders with special rights of control. Employees who are also shareholders of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG exercise their voting rights individually.
The Management Board does not have powers to issue or repurchase shares except to the extent provided by law.
The agreements for the Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) and credit lines (syndicated loans) contain change of control clauses that grant the lenders an extraordinary right to call the loans.
With this exception, there are no significant agreements that take effect, change materially, or end, in the case of a change of control resulting from a takeover offer. No compensation agreements
in the event of a public tender offer exist between the Company and its Management Board, Super- visory Board or other staff.

Outlook
With its diversified business model and sound balance sheet, AGRANA regards itself as well positioned for the future. As a result of the current challenges in the Sugar segment, however, the Group’s operating profit (EBIT) is expected to decrease significantly in the 2018|19 financial year. Revenue is projected to be in line with the year before.

In the Sugar segment, AGRANA foresees decreasing sugar sales volumes and prices and therefore expects revenue to decline significantly. The ongoing cost reduction programmes will only be able to soften the margin reduction to some extent, and a significant decrease in EBIT is thus expected for the 2018|19 financial year.
The capital expenditures planned for the Sugar segment amount to approximately € 30 million. Besides asset replacement and maintenance investment, the spending will especially be directed to measures to boost revenue and efficiency.

   For the Starch segment, a moderate increase in revenue is forecast for the 2018|19 financial year. Sales volumes are to rise significantly, thanks also to the full utilisation of the additional corn grinding capacity in Aschach, Austria. The positive impetus for specialty products (including organic grades) and generally for starches and by-products is expected to continue. For bioethanol and starch-based saccharification products, however, sales prices are likely to decrease amid the challenging market environment, and with expected slightly rising raw material prices, a moderate decline in EBIT is thus predicted for the Starch segment.

Investment of approximately € 86 million is budgeted for the Starch segment. The largest single share of this is allocated to the expansion of the wheat starch plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria. Other planned projects are the expansion of potato processing capacity in Gmünd, Austria, and investment in productivity increases in Aschach.

  In the Fruit segment, AGRANA expects the 2018|19 financial year to bring significant growth
in revenue and EBIT. Revenue of the fruit preparations business is predicted to increase, driven by rising sales volumes in all areas (particularly in non-dairy). The synergy effects in Argentina, the start of fruit preparations production in India and the planned opening of the new Chinese produc- tion site in Jiangsu, China, in November 2018 are expected to contribute to a moderate EBIT improve- ment in comparison with the 2017|18 financial year. In the fruit juice concentrate business, revenue and EBIT are projected to rise significantly in the new financial year.
The capital investment budgeted in the Fruit segment is approximately € 53 million. In the fruit preparations business, the construction of the second plant in China will be the largest single project; the focus in the fruit juice concentrate operations is on asset replacement and maintenance invest- ment, production optimisation and the continuous improvement of product quality.

  For ever more consumers, the safeguarding and documentation of sustainable business practices along the entire product value chain is becoming a buying criterion. This has been reflected
in the sourcing criteria of AGRANA’s customers for a number of years. As a result of the EU Non- financial Reporting Directive applicable since the 2017 calendar year and of national legislation in the EU member states, the AGRANA Group is now also legally obliged to report on non-financial sustainability topics.
Since the 2012|13 financial year, AGRANA has been reporting annually on relevant matters in an integrated form. The Group as early as 2014|15 set goals and targets for further improving environ- mental and social performance in its own production facilities and for its employees, and added further objectives in 2015|16, particularly regarding sustainability in the supply chain. The current target period runs to the end of the 2020|21 financial year. Each year the target achievement progress will continue to be reported in the non-financial information integrated in the annual report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG (“the Company”) is the parent company of the AGRANA Group and has its registered office
at Friedrich-Wilhelm-Raiffeisen-Platz 1, A-1020 Vienna. The Company together with its subsidiaries constitutes an inter- national group engaged mainly in the worldwide industrial processing of agricultural raw materials.
The consolidated financial statements of the AGRANA Group for 2017|18 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in effect at the balance sheet date and with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union, as well as with the additional requirements of section 245a Austrian Commercial Code (UGB).
1. Segment information
The segment reporting, which conforms with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 8, distinguishes between three business segments – Sugar, Starch and Fruit – and thus follows the AGRANA Group’s internal reporting structure.
The AGRANA Group has the three reportable segments Sugar, Starch and Fruit, which correspond to its strategic businesses. The segments differ in terms of their product portfolios, production technologies, raw material procurement, and sales strategies, and are managed separately. AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft (“AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG”), the Group’s holding company, is considered part of the Sugar segment.
The internal reporting for each segment is provided monthly to the Group’s chief operating decision-maker (the CODM). The CODM is the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Information on the results of the reportable segments is found in the overviews below. Segment profitability is evaluated primarily on the basis of operating profit (EBIT), which
is a key performance indicator in every internal management report.
In the reporting of the reportable segments to the CODM, AGRANA uses the performance indicator “operating profit before exceptional items and results of equity-accounted joint ventures”. This item differs from the metric “operating profit” (EBIT) used in the consolidated income statement in that operating profit (EBIT) reflects the results of equity-accounted joint ventures and exceptional items. Exceptional items are infrequent or non-recurring expenses or income that exceed
a defined amount and that do not arise in the ordinary course of business.

           The revenue and asset data represent consolidated amounts. Inter-segment charges for products and services are based on comparable market prices.
Exceptional items included restructuring expenses as well as income from the refunding of excess amounts of sugar production levies collected by the EU in the 1999|00 and 2000|01 sugar marketing years.
The items “segment assets” and “segment liabilities” match the allocation used in internal reporting. The inter-segment consolidation consisted of liability and dividend consolidation of € 679,509 thousand (prior year: € 650,764 thousand) and capital consolidation of € 351,642 thousand (prior year: € 351,642 thousand).

      Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros (€000) unless otherwise indicated. As a result of automated calculation, rounding errors may occur in totals of rounded amounts and percentages.
In the presentation of the income statement, the nature of expense method was used. The separate financial statements of the fully consolidated companies represented in the consolidated financial statements are based on uniform accounting policies.
In the 2017|18 financial year, the following standards became effective (i.e., their application became mandatory) for the first time. The changes had no material impacts on the presentation of AGRANA’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

  Content and expected impacts on AGRANA
 Under the amended standard, if an amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs in a defined benefit plan, the current service cost and the net interest for the remainder of the reporting period (after the change to the plan) must be recalculated using
the actuarial assumptions that were applied in the required remeasurement of the net liability or asset. In addition, the amended standard clarifies how a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement affects the asset ceiling requirements. Provided that no events within this scope occur, the amendments are not relevant to AGRANA.
No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
The amendment clarifies that IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) applies to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but that are not accounted for using the equity method. The amendment is not relevant to AGRANA.
The amendment is not relevant to AGRANA. The standard is not relevant to AGRANA. The standard is not relevant to AGRANA.

Content and expected impacts on AGRANA
The new rules for classifying financial assets according to the business model within which they are managed will in some cases lead to changes in measurement and presentation. Differences result primarily for investment fund units, which to date have been classified to the “available-for-sale” category. Valuation differences will in future be recognised in net financial items instead of directly in equity as before, as the payments in connection with the investment funds do not consist only of interest and principal payments. In the 2017|18 financial year, the measurement through profit or loss, if applied, would have led to an improvement of about € 0.1 million in net financial items. In future, the new rules on impairment will in some cases lead to the earlier recognition of expected losses as an expense. As a high proportion of receivables carries credit insurance, the new approach of recognising impairment for credit risks on receivables in accordance with the length of time overdue (using a provision matrix) is expected to require an additional loss allowance of only approximately € 0.2 million. In hedge accounting, in the future, more components
can in some cases be included in the risk hedged, which will then slightly increase the level of hedge effectiveness.
The amendment establishes that certain financial instruments with symmetrical termination and compensation clauses (prepayment features with negative compensation) that otherwise would have to be measured through profit or loss can be measured at amortised cost. The amendment is not relevant to AGRANA.
No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
The standard is not relevant to AGRANA. The European Commission has decided not to launch the endorsement process for this interim standard but to wait for the final standard.
IFRS 15 establishes the principles that an entity shall apply in reporting about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. Specifically, it also establishes criteria for determining whether different performance obligations under a contract are distinct. AGRANA does not expect the application of the standard to result in a change in equity at the transition date.
The amendment to IFRS 15 provides clarifications on the identification of performance obligations, the control of leased assets, and activities of an entity that significantly affect intellectual property. The amendment also introduces transition relief for
the presentation of contracts concluded or modified before the earliest period presented. No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
IFRS 16 establishes new rules for the recognition, measurement and presentation of leases. The standard provides only a single accounting model for the lessee, requiring the right of use to be recognised as the asset, and the obligation to be recognised
as a liability, in the balance sheet. For assets with a low value and for short-term leases, AGRANA will elect not to capitalise the lease. AGRANA uses leases for long-term rental agreements for land and buildings in administration and production. A hypothetical initial application at 28 February 2018 would result in a right-of-use asset/a lease liability of about € 37 million.
The standard is not relevant to AGRANA.
The amendments to IFRS 12 are already effective from 2017|18. The amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28 become effective in 2018|19. No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.
IFRIC 23 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. Judgement is to be used in determining whether tax treatments should be considered independently or collectively. No impacts on the presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows are expected.

            107

Pages 104 to 107 provide an overview of the standards and interpretations that will become effective in the 2018|19 financial year or later. For those standards not yet adopted by the EU, the effective year for AGRANA given in the table represents the expected time of adoption. AGRANA has not early-adopted any of the new or changed standards and interpretations cited below. The information provided on the content of the standards depends on whether and to what extent they are relevant to AGRANA. Where accounting rules becoming effective in subsequent periods do not apply to AGRANA’s situation, no information on their content is given.
3. Scope of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include, by full consolidation, all domestic and foreign companies controlled by AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG (i.e., all subsidiaries), except where the subsidiary’s effect on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows is immaterial. Control exists when AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has the power to participate
in positive and negative variable returns of a company (an investee) and to affect these returns. This is usually given when AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG owns more than one-half of the voting rights of the investee.
Companies managed jointly with another entity, where control is exercised jointly and the investors have joint rights to the net assets of the investee, are joint ventures and are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
At the balance sheet date, 62 companies besides the parent were fully consolidated in the Group financial statements (prior year: 60 companies) and 13 companies were included using the equity method (prior year: 12 companies).
An overview of the fully consolidated entities, equity-accounted joint ventures, and non-consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures is presented below.

Non-controlling interests
Of the non-controlling interests of € 56,954 thousand (prior year: € 62,222 thousand), most represented the co-owners of the AUSTRIA JUICE group, at € 37,523 thousand (prior year: € 43,377 thousand). AGRANA’s total interests in the AUSTRIA JUICE group amounted to 50.01%.

4. Consolidation methods
█ Acquisitions of companies that are fully consolidated are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. Where a business combination entails the possible recognition of intangible assets not previously recognised in the separate financial statements of the acquired company, such as customer relationships, these are recognised only when the requirements under IAS 38 for capitalisation are met. For acquisitions of a majority interest rather than a 100% stake in a company, IFRS 3 provides an accounting policy choice as to how to measure the resulting non-controlling interests. The non-controlling interests may be measured either at their proportionate share of the fair value of the
net assets of the acquiree (partial goodwill method) or at their proportionate share of goodwill (full goodwill method). This choice is available individually for each business combination. The full goodwill method has not been applied in the AGRANA Group to date.
█ The investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the time of acquisition, provided that the requirements for the application of IFRS 11
(Joint Arrangements) are met. Profits or losses resulting from transactions of the AGRANA Group with a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture.
█ Intragroup revenues, expenses and income and all receivables and payables or provisions between the consoli- dated companies are eliminated. In assets that arise from intragroup flows of products or services and are included in non-current assets or in inventories, intragroup balances are eliminated.
5. Currency translation
█ Financial statements of foreign Group companies are translated into euros in accordance with IAS 21. The functional currency of every Group company is its respective national currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the ECB reference rates of exchange or other published reference rates at the balance sheet date (i.e., at period-end rates). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Expenses and income are translated at annual average rates of exchange (the mean of the daily rates of the ECB or national banks), with the exception of the currency translation gains and losses from the measurement of receivables and liabilities related to Group financing.
█ Differences compared to prior-year amounts arising from the translation of balance sheet items at current balance sheet date exchange rates or arising from the use of average rates in translating expenses and income compared to
the use of current balance sheet date rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. Specifically, they are presented in the statement of other comprehensive income as currency translation differences related to consolidation.

6. Accounting policies
6.1. Intangible assets (including goodwill) and property, plant and equipment
16.64
               █ Purchased intangible assets (other than goodwill) are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives of between 5 and 15 years. Almost all intangible assets have a determinable useful life. Those intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not material for the Group.
█ Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. This review is performed regularly
at 31 August, and additionally whenever there are indications of possible impairment (triggering events). Details on this impairment test are presented in the notes to the balance sheet.
█ Items of property, plant and equipment are valued at cost of purchase and/or conversion, less straight-line or cam- paign-based depreciation and impairment losses. In the conversion costs of internally generated assets, besides materials and labour costs, prorated overheads are capitalised. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of an asset that are incurred during the production period are capitalised in accordance with IAS 23. All other borrowing costs
are recognised as an expense in the period during which they are incurred. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, unless they result in an expansion or significant improvement of the asset concerned, in which case they are capitalised.
█ Where rental agreements or leases transfer all material risks and rewards of ownership to the AGRANA Group (finance leases), the assets rented or leased are recorded as an asset. The asset is initially measured at the lower of its fair value at the inception of the rental period or lease and the present value of the future minimum rental or lease payments. This amount is simultaneously recorded as a liability under borrowings.
█ Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is generally based on the following useful lives:
Buildings
Plant and machinery
Office furniture and equipment
15 to 50 years 10 to 15 years 3 to 10 years
1.06
  115

116
6.2. Government assistance
█ Government assistance to reimburse the Group for costs is recognised as other operating income in the period in which the related costs are incurred, unless the assistance is contingent on conditions that are not yet sufficiently likely to be met.
█ Government assistance to support capital expenditure is recognised as deferred income from the time of the binding award and deducted from the cost of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the allocated asset through profit or loss. Details are provided on page 133.
6.3. Financial instruments
█ The AGRANA Group distinguishes the following classes of financial instruments:
Financial assets
– Securities, and investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies
– Trade receivables
– Other financial assets
– Cash and cash equivalents
Financial liabilities
– Bank loans and overdrafts, and other loans from non-Group entities
– Borrowings from affiliated companies in the Südzucker group
– Finance lease liabilities
– Trade payables
– Financial other payables
Derivative financial instruments
– Interest-rate derivatives
– Currency derivatives
– Commodity derivatives
█ Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies, as well as securities, are classified to the avail- able-for-sale category and are initially measured at fair value in the case of securities, and at cost in the case of invest- ments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies, including any transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is at fair value. Changes in value are recognised outside profit or loss (after income tax) in a separate reserve item in equity. Only after the cumulative changes in fair value are realised by selling the asset are they recognised in the income statement. Available-for-sale non-material investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies are measured at cost.
█ Financial assets are recognised at the settlement date.
█ Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and bank deposits having a remaining term to maturity of up to three months at the time of investment. Cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are measured at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments
█ Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge risks from changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. Derivatives are carried as an asset or liability and, irrespective of their purpose, are measured at fair value. Changes in their fair value are recognised through profit or loss in other operating income/expenses (for commodity derivatives and currency derivatives related to purchase and sales transactions) or in net financial items (for interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives related to financings), unless the derivatives are used to hedge an underlying transaction (cash flow
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

hedges). Where the conditions for cash flow hedge accounting under IAS 39 are met, the unrealised effective changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity. They are reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction affects profit or loss. Ineffective portions of the valuation gains or losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement immediately. Derivatives are classified as held for trading, except for derivatives in a hedging relationship with a hedged item that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. More information on derivative financial instruments is provided from page 145.
Receivables
█ Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Non-interest-bearing receivables with a remaining maturity of more than one year are recognised at their present value using the effective interest method. For default risks or other risks contained in receivables, sufficient impairment provisions are individually allowed. Receivables that are individually immaterial, and receivables with similar default risk, are grouped together and impairment is recognised on the basis of historical experience. The face amounts of the receivables net of necessary impairment provisions represent the fair values. Irrecoverable receivables are derecognised on an individual case-by-case basis. If the reasons for an impairment provision cease to apply, the impairment loss is reversed, to no more than the asset’s historical cost.
█ Foreign currency receivables are measured at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Payables
█ Borrowings are initially measured at their actual proceeds. Premiums, discounts or other differences between the proceeds and the repayment amount are realised over the term of the instrument by the effective interest method and recognised in net financial items (at amortised cost).
█ Trade payables are initially measured (at inception of the liability) at the fair value of the goods or services received. Subsequently these payables are measured at amortised cost. Other payables not resulting from the receipt of goods or services are measured at their payable amount.
█ Payables denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
6.4. Inventories
█ Inventories are measured at the lower of cost of purchase and/or conversion and net selling price. The weighted average cost formula is used. In accordance with IAS 2, the conversion costs of unfinished and finished products include – in addition to directly attributable unit costs – reasonable proportions of the necessary material costs and production overheads inclusive of depreciation of manufacturing plant (based on the assumption of normal capacity utilisation) as well as production-related administrative costs. Financing costs are not taken into account. To the extent that inventories are at risk as a result of prolonged storage or reduced saleability, a write-down is recognised.
6.5. Emission allowances
█ Emission rights are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), IAS 20 (Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance) and IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets). Emission allowances are issued for a given calendar year and are intangible assets for the purposes of IAS 38 that, except as noted below, are to be classified as current assets. They are assigned a cost of zero. From the point when emissions exceed allocated allowances (one allowance represents one tonne of carbon dioxide), a provision for CO2 emissions must be established for actual additional emissions and recognised in the income statement. The provision is calculated by taking into account the cost incurred for purchased emission allowances or any excess of their market value at the measure- ment date over their cost. CO2 emission allowances that have already been purchased for use in a subsequent trading period are recorded in non-current assets.
Accounting policies
117

118
6.6. Impairment
█ Assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) are reviewed at every balance sheet date for evidence
of impairment. When there are indications of impairment, an impairment test is performed on the assets in question. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually at 31 August regardless of whether there is indication of possible impairment.
█ The impairment test involves determining the asset’s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s value in use and its net selling price. If the asset’s recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the difference is expensed as an impairment loss in the income statement.
█ An asset’s value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the asset’s continuing use and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. The discount rate used in determining present value is a pre-tax market rate adjusted for the specific risks of the asset concerned. Where no largely independent cash inflows can be determined, value in use is determined for the next-larger unit (the cash-generating unit) to which the asset belongs and for which largely independent cash inflows can be determined.
█ Where an impairment loss later decreases or is eliminated, the amount of the reversal of the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill and equity-like securities classified as available-for-sale) is recognised as income in the income statement up to the lower of amortised original cost and value in use. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
6.7. Employee benefit obligations
█ The AGRANA Group maintains both defined contribution and defined benefit plans for pensions and termination benefits. Under the defined contribution pension and termination benefit arrangements, AGRANA has no further obliga- tion after paying the agreed premium. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense when they fall due, and are reported in staff costs. Contributions paid to government plans are treated in the same manner as those paid to defined contribution plans. As the Group has no payment obligations beyond making the contributions,
no provision is maintained.
█ The provisions for defined benefit pension, termination and long-service obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee Benefits), based on actuarial valuations. This involves determining the present value of the defined benefit obligation and comparing it to the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date. In the case of a deficit, a provision is recorded; in the case of a surplus, an asset (other receivable) is recorded. The defined benefit obligation is measured by the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the future payments determined on the basis of realistic assumptions are accumulated over the period during which the respective beneficia- ries acquire the entitlement to these benefits.
█ Service cost is recognised in staff costs. Besides the current service cost for the benefits newly earned by staff every year, it may also include past service cost arising from plan curtailments or changes, which is recognised immediately in profit
or loss for the period. The net interest cost for the financial year is calculated by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the year to the net pension obligation determined at that time, taking into account the expected payment outflows. Net interest is recognised in finance expense.
█ Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions or from differences between previous actuarial assumptions and observed outcomes are recognised directly in equity in the period in which they occur, along with their effect on deferred taxes (with the exception of obligations for long-service awards). Correspondingly, the full amount of the obligation is recognised in the balance sheet. The changes in actuarial gains and losses recognised in the respective period are presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity cannot be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The recognition in other compre- hensive income also includes the differences between (i) the interest income on plan assets based on the discount rate and included in net interest and (ii) the actual return on plan assets determined at the end of the period.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

█ The calculation is based on extrapolated future trends in salaries, retirement benefits and employee turnover, as well as a discount rate of predominantly 1.7% for the year under review (prior year: 1.6%).
█ A portion of pension obligations was transferred to pension funds. The retirement benefit contributions to be paid
are calculated so as to fully fund the retirement benefit obligation at the time of retirement. If a plan deficit occurs, there is an obligation to fund the shortfall. The Group also holds benefit insurance policies to secure its ability to meet obliga- tions under pension and termination benefit plans. The individual assets allocated to the pension plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the net obligation. Likewise, the qualifying insurance policies are treated as plan assets in reducing the present value of the respective pension and termination benefit obligation.
6.8. Other provisions
█ Other provisions are recognised where the following conditions are met: the AGRANA Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, the obligation is likely to lead to an outflow of resources, and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
█ Provisions are measured at the amount representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. If the present value of the obligation determined on the basis of a market interest rate differs materially from its nominal amount, the present value of the obligation is used.
█ The risks arising from contingent liabilities are covered by sufficient provisions.
█ Provisions for reclamation comprise obligations for reclamation of properties, emptying and rehabilitation of landfills, remediation or restoration of building structures, legacy soil reclamation and removal of waste residues.
█ “Provisions for staff costs including long-service awards” also include provisions for phased retirement, provisions for redundancy benefit plans under restructuring projects, provisions for bonuses and awards, and other personnel-related provisions. Under IAS 19, long-service awards are classified as long-term employee benefits. These are determined by
the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the current period in staff costs. Long-service awards are one-time payments dependent on level of salary or wage and length of service and are stipulated under local company agreements or collective agreements. Obligations for the payment of such service anniversary bonuses exist especially in Austria and Germany. In Austria, provisions for phased retirement must be created as a result of labour laws regarding obligations to employees. The legislation concerning phased retirement makes it easier for companies to employ older staff members working reduced hours with substantial financial security until full retirement. Provisions for redundancy benefit plans under restructurings are created only if a formal, detailed restructuring plan has been prepared and communicated.
█ Provisions for uncertain liabilities include, among other items, provisions for litigation risks, onerous contracts,
costs of beet receiving, loading and storage, and other uncertain liabilities. A provision for onerous (loss-making) contracts is recognised if the expected economic benefit from a contract is less than the unavoidable cost of fulfilling the contract.
6.9. Deferred taxes
█ Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the IFRS carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base; on consolidation entries; and on tax loss carryforwards expected to be utilised. Significant differences exist between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base for property, plant and equipment, inventories and provisions. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax loss carryforwards insofar as these are expected to be utilised within five years.
█ Deferred taxes are calculated by the liability method (under IAS 12), based on the pertinent national income tax rates. Consequently, with the exception of goodwill arising on consolidation, deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the tax base, to the extent that deferred tax assets are likely to be realised.
Accounting policies
119

120
█ When income and expenses are recognised directly in equity, the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities are also taken directly to equity. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and from tax loss carryforwards takes into account company-specific forecasts of, for instance, the future earnings situation in the respective Group company. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if the associated tax benefits are expected
to be realisable over a five-year planning horizon. This is the case if sufficient profits can be earned or if there is sufficient taxable income from the reversal of temporary differences previously recognised as liabilities.
█ Deferred tax assets are classified as non-current assets; deferred tax liabilities are recorded as non-current liabilities. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same tax authority.
█ The income tax reported represents the tax levied in the individual countries on taxable income, and the movement in deferred taxes.
6.10. Recognition of revenue and costs
█ Revenue from goods sold is recognised when substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership have passed
to the purchaser. Revenue from services provided is recognised to the extent that the services have been rendered by the balance sheet date.
█ Operating expenses are recognised in the income statement upon use of the product or service or as incurred.
█ Finance expenses comprise the interest expense, similar expenses and transaction costs on borrowings including finance leases; financing-related currency translation gains and losses; and financing-related hedging gains and losses.
█ Income from financial investments represents interest, dividend and similar income realised from cash-equivalent investments and investments in other financial assets; gains and losses on the disposal of financial assets; and impairment losses and impairment loss reversals.
█ Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised at the time of the decision to pay the dividend.
6.11. Critical assumptions and judgements
█ The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company’s manage- ment to make judgements and to act on assumptions about future developments. These judgements and assumptions can have a material effect on the recognition and measurement of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of other liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of income and expenses reported for the financial year.
█ The following assumptions involve a not insignificant risk that they may lead to a material change in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year:
– The impairment testing of goodwill (carrying amount at 28 February 2018: € 260,956 thousand; carrying amount at
28 February 2017: € 260,974 thousand), other intangible assets (carrying amount at 28 February 2018: € 15,859 thousand; carrying amount at 28 February 2017: € 21,345 thousand) and property, plant and equipment (carrying amount at
28 February 2018: € 768,881 thousand; carrying amount at 28 February 2017: € 738,907 thousand) is based on forward- looking assumptions. The determination of the recoverable amounts for the purpose of the impairment test involves several assumptions, such as regarding future net cash flows and the discount rate. The net cash flows are the amounts in the most current cash flow forecast for the cash-generating units (CGUs) for the next five years (most current at the time of the regular impairment test date of 31 August).
– It was determined through a simulation that a hypothetical reduction of 5% in sustainable cash flows would not lead to an impairment of goodwill.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

– The discount rate before tax varies by industry, company risk level and specific market environment; in the financial year it ranged from 5.60% to 8.50% (prior year: 4.94% to 8.55%).
– An increase of 0.5 percentage points in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) would not lead to impairment.
– Financial instruments for which no active market exists are reviewed for impairment by using alternative discount- ing-based valuation methods. The inputs used for the determination of fair value are based in part on assumptions concerning the future.
– The measurement of existing retirement and termination benefit obligations (carrying amount at 28 February 2018: € 68,704 thousand; carrying amount at 28 February 2017: € 68,929 thousand) involves assumptions regarding discount rate, age at retirement, life expectancy, employee turnover and future increases in pay and benefits.
– The sensitivity analysis below is based on varying one assumption at a time with the other assumptions remaining unchanged from the original calculation. Potential correlation effects between assumptions are thus not taken into account. The changes in assumptions would have the following effects on the present values of the obligations stated in note 24a:

                – The recognition of deferred tax assets (carrying amount at 28 February 2018: € 13,664 thousand; carrying amount at 28 February 2017: € 14,334 thousand) is based on the assumption that sufficient taxable profit will be earned over the five-year planning horizon to realise them.
– The off-balance sheet obligations from financial guarantees and from other contingent liabilities, and any reductions in these obligations, are regularly reviewed as to whether they require recognition in the balance sheet.
– In determining the amount of other provisions (carrying amount at 28 February 2018: € 50,944 thousand; carrying amount at 28 February 2017: € 63,352 thousand), management exercises judgement as to whether AGRANA is likely to incur an outflow of resources from the obligation concerned and whether the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
█ The HUNGRANA group and AGRANA-STUDEN group were classified as joint ventures in accordance with IFRS 11 and the agreements existing at the time. The AGRANA Group holds 50% of the share capital of the joint ventures.
█ The AGRANA Group holds 50.01% of the share capital of AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH and is subsidiaries. As a result of
the underlying contracts and arrangements, AGRANA exercises control over these companies and fully consolidates them in the Group accounts.

Interest expense includes the interest component of € 107 thousand (prior year: € 124 thousand) from the discounting of the non-current obligation for long-service awards.
Net currency translation differences on financing activities amounted to a loss of € 14,643 thousand (prior year: gain
of € 4,705 thousand). This was composed of a realised loss of € 2,565 thousand (prior year: realised gain of € 743 thousand) and an unrealised loss of € 12,078 thousand (prior year: unrealised gain of € 3,962 thousand). The net translation
loss was attributable primarily to foreign currency financings in Argentina and Brazil (euro and US dollar financings) and US dollar credit balances in the euro area.
In the prior year the item “miscellaneous finance expense” included a non-recurring expense of € 4,761 thousand as a result of an impairment charge on cash and cash equivalents in Ukraine in the Fruit segment.

           The Tax Reform Act of 2005 introduced a new concept for the taxation of company groups. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, the AGRANA Group established a group consisting of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG as the group parent and the following group members: AGRANA Zucker GmbH, AGRANA Stärke GmbH, AGRANA Marketing- und Vertriebs- service Gesellschaft mbH, AGRANA Internationale Verwaltungs- und Asset-Management GmbH, AGRANA Group-Services GmbH, INSTANTINA Nahrungsmittel Entwicklungs- und Produktionsgesellschaft m.b.H. and AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH.
Deferred taxes are recognised on differences between carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of the individual companies in their home countries. Deferred taxes take into account carryforwards of unused tax losses.
127

Note (13)
In the interest of conservative planning, deferred taxes reflect carryforwards of tax losses only to the extent that sufficient taxable profit is likely to be earned over the next five years to utilise the deferred tax assets. € 12,589 thousand (prior year: € 13,902 thousand) of potential tax assets were not recognised. These related to cumulative unused tax loss carryforwards
of € 53,898 thousand (prior year: € 60,871 thousand). Of the unused tax loss carryforwards, € 31,486 thousand (prior year: € 31,175 thousand) can be carried forward indefinitely, € 13,538 thousand (prior year: € 26,786 thousand) expire in two to four years and € 8,874 thousand (prior year: € 2,910 thousand) expire in five to seven years.
At the balance sheet date the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised directly in equity amounted to a net asset of € 7,228 thousand (prior year: € 7,392 thousand).
For temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities of € 219,864 thousand (prior year:
€ 211,264 thousand) were not recognised, as these gains are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period and these temporary differences are thus not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.

8. Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement
7.13
The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method and in accordance with IAS 7. The statement traces the movements in the AGRANA Group’s cash and cash equivalents arising from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, represent cash on hand, cheques and bank deposits.
There were no restrictions on access to cash and cash equivalents of subsidiaries as a result of currency legislation (prior year: € 16,887 thousand).
Cash and cash equivalents do not include current bank borrowings or securities classified as current assets.
The currency translation effects, except those on cash and cash equivalents, are already eliminated in the respective balance sheet items.

Note (14)
8.1. Cash flows from operating activities
Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was € 302,745 thousand (prior year: € 258,020 thousand), or 11.80% of revenue (prior year: 10.07%). Within “non-cash expenses/income and other adjustments”, non-cash expenses/ income consisted mainly of the unrealised currency translation losses of € 12,079 thousand (prior year: unrealised translation gains of € 3,962 thousand) reflected in net financial items, a valuation decrease of € 2,466 thousand
on payables from the acquisition of subsidiaries, a non-cash expense of € 589 thousand (prior year: € 284 thousand) for impairment on receivables, and non-cash inventory write-downs of € 8,756 thousand (prior year: € 4,640 thousand). The component “other adjustments” concerned corrections of the tax expense and net interest expense as a consequence of the separate presentation of that portion of interest and income taxes which represents cash flows. After changes
in working capital and after cash flows from interest and taxes, net cash from operating activities was € 213,864 thousand (prior year: € 255,785 thousand).
8.2. Cash flows from investing activities
The reduction of € 38,184 thousand in net cash used in investing activities (from € 171,530 thousand to € 133,346 thousand) resulted largely from the fact that the prior year included payments of € 45,467 thousand for the acquisition of two Argentine subsidiaries. Outflows for investment in property, plant and equipment and intangibles increased only slightly, by € 9,110 thousand to € 132,528 thousand (prior year: € 123,418 thousand). AGRANA’s share (€ 1,500 thousand) of the capital contribution in the AGRANA-STUDEN group is included in purchases of non-current financial assets; in the prior year this item included AGRANA’s share (€ 3,750 thousand) of the capital increase of the AGRANA-STUDEN group.
Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to € 627 thousand (prior year: € 1,155 thousand).
8.3. Cash flows from financing activities
Borrowings (net of unrealised currency translation losses) rose by € 58,115 thousand in the 2017|18 financial year (prior year: reduction of € 158,111 thousand). The positive cash flow from borrowings was driven primarily by the fact that, in the year under review, the raising of two long-term financings totalling € 100,000 thousand more than offset the combination of a loan repayment of € 25,500 thousand to the non-controlling shareholder and the repayment of cash advances,
bank overdrafts and maturing bank loans. The significantly higher cash outflows in the prior year were explained mainly by the repayment of two syndicated loans in a total amount of € 111,100 thousand.
In the year under review, net cash used in financing activities rose substantially, reflecting the net effect of the repay- ment of € 100,000 thousand of borrowings from affiliated companies of the Südzucker Group, the raising of an investment loan of € 41,500 thousand from the European Investment Bank, and the repayment of a Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) of € 83,500 thousand (prior year: loan increase of € 85,000 thousand, and inflow of € 139,719 thousand from the cash capital increase).
Dividends paid consisted mainly of the cash dividend distributed to the shareholders of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. The following table presents the changes in liabilities arising from financing activities:

█ Intangible assets consist largely of acquired customer relationships, software, patents and similar rights.
█ The additions of € 2,398 thousand (prior year: € 1,215 thousand) of intangible assets related primarily to software.
█ Of the total carrying amount of goodwill, the Fruit segment accounted for € 239,239 thousand (prior year:
€ 239,257 thousand), the Sugar segment for € 20,111 thousand (prior year: € 20,111 thousand) and the Starch segment for € 1,606 thousand (prior year: € 1,606 thousand).
█ To satisfy the provisions of IFRS 3 in conjunction with IAS 36 and to allow the calculation of any impairment of goodwill, AGRANA has defined its cash-generating units to match its internal reporting structure. The cash-generating units in the AGRANA Group are the Sugar segment, Starch segment and Fruit segment, consistent with the internal management accounting and reporting processes. All goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units.

█ To test for impairment, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is measured by allocating to it the corresponding assets and liabilities, inclusive of attributable goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment is recognised in profit or loss when the recoverable amount (value in use) of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount inclusive of goodwill.
█ In testing for impairment, AGRANA uses a discounted cash flow method to determine the value in use of the cash- generating units. The determination of expected cash flows from each cash-generating unit is based on business plans that are validated and approved by Supervisory Board committees and have a planning horizon of five years. Projections beyond a five-year horizon are based on the assumption of a constant, inflation-induced growth rate of 1.5% per year (assumption in the prior year: 1.5%). The cost of capital (WACC) is calculated as the weighted average cost of equity and debt capital for each CGU.
█ The cost of equity is based on a risk-free rate, a return premium for the business risk, and a premium for country risk and inflation differential. The spot rate of a 30-year zero coupon bond, based on Deutsche Bundesbank data,
was used as the risk-free rate of return. Business risk is represented by the product of a general market risk premium of 6.75% (prior year: 7.0%) and a beta factor derived from a peer group of nine companies. The country risk and the inflation differential are assigned a volatility factor of 1.23 (prior year: 1.40).
█ The cost of debt capital is calculated as the risk-free rate, the inflation differential, and the credit spread determined by reference to the capital market.
The following table presents the carrying amounts of the goodwill and the respective discount rate (WACC):

   █ The quality of the forecast data is frequently tested against actual outcomes with the help of variance analysis. The insights gained are then taken into account during the preparation of the next annual plan. Projections of value in use are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding future local market developments and volume trends. Value in use is therefore ascertained both on the basis of experience and of assumptions that are reviewed with experts for the regional markets.
█ The most important forecast assumptions for the Sugar CGU are the estimates of EU beet sugar production and isoglucose production, of the trajectories of sugar imports and exports, and of sugar prices. The major cost elements for the CGU are raw material and energy costs. Besides the current market developments, these projections also take into consideration internal estimates by the respective businesses.
█ With the elimination of the quota and minimum beet price regulations in 2017, the restrictions on sugar exports also ended. Market prices in the EU are now even more strongly determined by world market prices. In the near term, the current low level of world market prices is thus a negative factor. We expect global sugar consumption to continue to rise from currently just over 180 million tonnes to more than 200 million tonnes by 2025. The resulting prospective balance of production volume and sales volume supports the sugar world market price in the medium to longer term.
█ The values in use were subjected to a sensitivity analysis. The results are presented from page 120.
█ The goodwill is not tax-deductible.
█ At the balance sheet date, other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that were not significant for the AGRANA Group were included.

█ The share capital at the balance sheet date was € 113,531,275 (prior year: € 113,531,275), divided into 15,622,244 (prior year: 15,622,244) voting ordinary bearer shares without par value. All shares were fully paid.
█ The movements in the Group’s equity are presented from page 100.
█ The capital reserves (“share premium and other capital reserves”) consist of share premium (i.e., additional paid-in capital) and of reserves resulting from the reorganisation of companies. A capital increase was completed in the 2016|17 financial year. The resulting share premium of € 131,699,375, less the after-tax cost of € 2,301,471 of the capital increase, was added to the equity item “share premium and other capital reserves”. Taxes of € 767,157 related to the cost of the capital increase were deducted from share premium and other capital reserves. At the balance sheet date the amount of share premium and other capital reserves was € 540,759,999 (prior year: € 540,759,999).
█ Retained earnings consist of the available-for-sale reserve and the reserves for cash flow hedges, actuarial gains
and losses, investments in equity-accounted joint ventures, effects of consolidation-related foreign currency translation, and accumulated profits/losses for the period.
█ The additional contributions by other shareholders of € 500 thousand represented the external share of a capital contribution in the AGRANA-STUDEN group.
█ Changes in ownership interests and scope of consolidation, amounting to a deduction of € 73 thousand, resulted from the purchase of shares of non-controlling shareholders of the fully consolidated S.C. AGRANA Romania S.A., Bucharest, Romania.

Disclosures on capital management
A key goal of equity management is the maintenance of sufficient equity resources to safeguard the Company’s continuing existence as a going concern and ensure continuity of dividends. Equity bore the following relationship to total capital:

Capital management at AGRANA means the management of equity and of net debt. By optimising these two measures, the Company seeks to achieve the best possible shareholder returns. In addition to the equity ratio, the most important control variable is the gearing ratio (net debt divided by total equity). The total cost of equity and debt capital employed and the risks associated with the different types of capital are continuously monitored.
The sound equity base gives AGRANA strategic flexibility and also demonstrates the Group’s financial stability and independence. In addition to its self-financing ability, AGRANA also has access to high, committed credit lines for its over- all financing needs.

    Provisions for retirement and termination benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19, using the projected unit credit method and taking into account future trends on an actuarial basis. For both the retirement and termination benefit obligations, the plans are defined benefit plans.
The present values of the obligations, and the associated plan assets where applicable, were determined based on the following actuarial parameters:
28 Feb % 2017
Expected rate of wage and salary increases
Austria and rest of Europe 2.5 Mexico/USA/South Korea 6.0/3.0/4.0

        136

A discount rate of 1.7% (prior year: 1.6%) was used in almost all cases in the determination of the provisions for pensions and termination benefits. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds with a duration matching the average weighted duration of the obligations.
The measurement process also involves other company-specific actuarial assumptions, such as the staff turnover rate. The current mortality tables recognised in the respective country are used as the biometric basis for the calculations – in Austria, this is the version of the computation tables by Pagler & Pagler specific to salaried employees (“AVÖ 2008-P- Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung”).
Defined benefit plans
Pension plans in the AGRANA Group are based largely on direct defined benefit commitments. The amounts of the pension benefits are usually determined by length of service and by pensionable pay. Termination benefit plans exist mainly
as a result of legal requirements or of obligations under collective agreements and the benefits represent one-time, lump sum payments. The amount of the termination benefits typically depends on final pay and length of service.
The provision in the balance sheet (the net liability) for pensions and termination benefits in the AGRANA Group represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets:

      AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG has direct defined benefit commitments in respect of Management Board members for retirement, disability and survivor pensions based on a fixed percentage of a pension assessment base. All pension benefit obligations are transferred to and administered by an external pension fund. The present value of the obligation was € 21,533 thousand (prior year: € 22,126 thousand) and the plan assets amounted to € 14,659 thousand (prior year: € 13,630 thousand). Further detail is provided in the section “Related party disclosures” in these notes.
In addition, there were direct defined benefit commitments, including survivor benefits, in respect of retired former employees of AGRANA Zucker GmbH in the amount of € 17,021 thousand (prior year: € 19,061 thousand), of AGRANA Stärke GmbH in the amount of € 2,399 thousand (prior year: € 2,522 thousand) and of AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH in the amount of € 206 thousand (prior year: € 220 thousand). The present value of the obligation of AUSTRIA JUICE GmbH is offset by plan assets in the form of pension risk transfer insurance of € 155 thousand (prior year: € 158 thousand).
At AGRANA Fruit Austria GmbH there are pension commitments in respect of active employees for retirement, disability and survivor benefits with a contractual (in some cases length-of-service-dependent) fixed benefit amount, and direct obligations in respect of retired former employees, including survivor benefits. The present value of these obligations was € 1,009 thousand (prior year: € 991 thousand) and there were plan assets in the form of pension insurance of € 565 thou- sand (prior year: € 511 thousand).

In Mexico there is a contractual obligation in respect of a defined set of recipients in the event of retirement or early retirement to pay a fixed percentage of a specified pensionable pay base in monthly instalments for a period of ten years. Alternatively, the recipient may choose a lump sum payment. The present value of this obligation was € 684 thousand (prior year: € 578 thousand), with plan assets in the form of pension insurance of € 73 thousand (prior year: € 81 thousand).

The AGRANA Group has the following main termination benefit plans:
The termination benefit plans most significant in amount exist in Austria and France. The plans represent legislated commitments to pay a lump sum benefit on termination of employment (unless terminated by the employee) and
in the event of retirement or death. The amount of the benefit depends on final pay and length of service. Termination benefit obligations in Austria and France are funded solely by provisions, in the amount of € 39,469 thousand (prior year: € 35,845 thousand).
In Russia and Ukraine there are termination benefit commitments (either legislated or based on company-wide agree- ments) that are minor in amount. These are payable as a lump sum on termination of employment (unless terminated by the employee) or on retirement. The benefit amount depends on final pay and length of service. These commitments in the amount of € 127 thousand (prior year: € 118 thousand) are covered solely by provisions.
The termination benefit arrangements in the USA consist of contractual commitments in respect of a defined set of recipients, while the commitments in Mexico are legislated obligations to all permanent and full-time employees.
In Mexico the termination benefit is paid if the employment relationship is terminated after 15 years or more of service, at retirement or in the event of disability or death. It takes the form of a lump sum in an amount that is based on final salary and length of service. In the USA, the benefit is paid on termination of employment and is based on final salary and length of service. In Mexico, plan assets of € 3 thousand (prior year: € 3 thousand) offset the present value of the obligation of € 134 thousand (prior year: € 125 thousand). In the USA, the commitments of € 1,136 thousand (prior year: € 1,274 thousand) are funded solely by provisions.
The present value of the obligation of the termination benefit plan for South Korea was € 1,892 thousand (prior year: € 1,671 thousand), while the plan assets amounted to € 1,451 thousand (prior year: € 1,219 thousand).

             The year’s actuarial result on pension and termination benefit provisions, which is recognised directly in
item “changes in actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities”,
loss of € 493 thousand (prior year: actuarial loss of € 3,607 thousand). The movement resulted primarily from a change in the discount rate, experience adjustments, changes in growth assumptions for the pension assessment base and future salaries, changes in expected retirement age and assumed employee turnover rates. As of 28 February 2018, net cumulative actuarial losses of € 39,137 thousand (prior year: net cumulative losses of € 38,644 thousand) had been offset against retained earnings, not taking into account deferred taxes.
The experience adjustments reflect the impacts on the plan liabilities of differences between the actual movement in the plan obligation during the year and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year. Such differences arise, especially, from actual rates of wage and salary increases, changes in pension benefits, employee turnover and biometric variables such as disability and mortality.
Composition of plan assets
The plan assets consist primarily of investments in an external pension fund and of pension benefit insurance policies. The fundamental objective for the plan assets is to provide, at all times, full coverage of the payment obligations arising from the respective benefit plans. The plan assets include neither financial instruments issued by the Group nor owner- occupied property.
At the balance sheet date the plan assets were invested in the following asset categories:

Besides general actuarial risks such as discount rate risk and longevity risk, these include the risk that actual outcomes will differ from actuarial assumptions such as rates of wage and salary growth, pension benefit trends, retirement age and employee turnover (early depar- tures). Risks in connection with the plan assets are capital market risks, credit risks and investment risks. Other risks lie in exchange rate fluctuation and changes in inflation rates.
The rate of return on plan assets is assumed to equal the discount rate. If the actual rate of return on plan assets is
less than the discount rate used, the respective net liability increases. The net liability is particularly strongly influenced by the discount rate, with the current low market interest rates contributing to a relatively high liability. A further decline in corporate bond yields would lead to a further increase in defined benefit liabilities that can only be off set
to a small degree by the increase in market values of the corporate bonds in the plan assets.
Potential inflation risks that may lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligations lie, indirectly, in inflation-driven salary growth during active service and in inflation-induced pension benefit increases.
Duration and future payments
The average weighted duration of the present value of the pension obligations at 28 February 2018 was 12.10 years (prior year: 12.46 years) and that of the termination benefit obligations was 8.54 years (prior year: 8.63 years).
€ 817 thousand of contributions are expected to be paid into the plan assets in the subsequent reporting period (prior year: € 633 thousand).
The amounts of pension and termination benefit payments in the next ten years are expected to be as follows:

        To cover its overall funding needs, the AGRANA Group, in addition to its self-financing capability, has access to syndicated credit lines and bilateral credit lines from banks.
Financial instruments are generally procured centrally and distributed Group-wide. The principal aims of obtaining financing are to achieve sustained growth in enterprise value, safeguard the Group’s credit quality and ensure its liquidity.
To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, the AGRANA Group in the course of its day-to-day financial manage- ment uses conventional investments (demand deposits, time deposits and securities) and borrowings (in the form of overdrafts, short-term funds and fixed rate loans).

Borrowings (excluding finance leases) consisted of bank loans and overdrafts, and borrowings from affiliated companies in the Südzucker group, in a total amount of € 369,591 thousand (prior year: € 453,814 thousand).
The weighted average interest rate paid on these credits was 1.42% (prior year: 2.12%), with a remaining maturity of 4.0 years (prior year: 2.0 years).
The credit funding of the AGRANA Group consisted primarily of two syndicated credit lines totalling € 450,000 thou- sand at the balance sheet date (prior year: € 450,000 thousand), a Schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) of € 42,500 thou- sand (prior year: € 126,000 thousand) and a financing from Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany, in the amount
of € 150,000 thousand (prior year: € 250,000 thousand). The rest of the credit funding consisted of bilateral credit lines.
The fixed interest portion of bank loans and overdrafts and amounts due to affiliated companies was € 262,268 thousand (prior year: € 284,086 thousand). The fair values (i.e., market values) of the variable rate bank loans and over-
drafts are equivalent to their carrying amounts. At the balance sheet date, bank loans and overdrafts in the amount of € 7,800 thousand (prior year: € 7,800 thousand) were secured by other liens.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased by € 77,468 thousand from the prior year to a new total of € 120,961 thousand.
In addition, securities in the amount of € 44 thousand (prior year: € 43 thousand) were held as current assets; these were categorised as held-for-trading.

10.2. Derivative financial instruments
To hedge part of the risks arising from its operating activities (risks due to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and raw material prices), the AGRANA Group to a limited extent uses derivative financial instruments. AGRANA employs derivatives largely to hedge the following exposures:
█ Interest rate risks, which can arise from floating rate borrowings.
█ Currency risks, which may arise primarily from the purchase and sale of products in US dollars and Eastern European currencies and from finance in foreign currencies.
█ Market price risks, arising especially from changes in commodity prices for sugar in the world market, grain prices, and selling prices for sugar and ethanol.
The Group employs only conventional derivatives for which there is a sufficiently liquid market (for example, interest rate swaps, interest rate options, caps, forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options or commodity futures). The use of these instruments is governed by Group policies under the Group’s risk management system. These policies prohibit the speculative use of derivative financial instruments, set ceilings appropriate to the underlying transactions, define authorisation procedures, minimise credit risks, and specify internal reporting rules and the organisational separa- tion of risk-taking and risk oversight. Adherence to these standards and the proper processing and valuation of trans- actions are regularly monitored by an internal department whose independence is ensured by organisational separation from risk origination.

The currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are used to hedge cash flows over periods of up to one year; the interest rate derivatives serve to hedge cash flows for periods of one to five years.
The notional amount of the derivatives represents the face amount of all hedges, translated into euros as the Group currency.
The fair value of a derivative is the amount which the AGRANA Group would have to pay or would receive at the balance sheet date in the hypothetical event of early termination of the hedge position. As the hedging transactions involve only standardised, fungible financial instruments, fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market prices.
Fair value changes of derivatives employed to hedge future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are initially recognised directly in equity. Only when the cash flows are realised are the value changes recognised in profit or loss. At 28 February 2018 there were cash flow hedges with positive fair values of € 803 thousand (prior year: € 314 thousand) and cash flow hedges with negative fair values of € 1,417 thousand (prior year: € 1,480 thousand).
The value changes of those derivative positions to which cash flow hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in profit or loss. The hedging transactions were carried out both to hedge sales revenue and raw material costs for the juice activities, and to hedge sales contracts in the Sugar segment.

The table below shows the periods in which the cash outflows are expected to occur, as well as the carrying amounts of the hedging instruments:

10.3. Additional disclosures on financial instruments
Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments
Set out in the table below are the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, both
by individual item type and by measurement category. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
The table below also shows how the fair values were determined, broken down by category of financial instrument. The fair value measurements were classified into three categories according to how closely the inputs used were based on quoted market data:
The three levels were defined as follows:
█ Level 1 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair value represents exchange or market prices quoted
for the exact instrument on an active market (i.e., these prices are used without adjustment or change in composition).
█ In Level 2, the fair values are determined on the basis of exchange or market prices quoted on an active market for similar assets or liabilities, or using other valuation techniques for which the significant inputs are based on observable market data.
█ Level 3 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair values are determined on the basis of valuation techniques using significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of Level 2 currency derivatives is measured based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date
and the underlying currencies’ interest rate differential relevant for the remaining maturity. The mark-to-market price is determined and compared with the price of the hedged item or transaction. The input factors for this are the reference rates of the ECB (daily fixing) or selected national central banks, and the daily EURIBOR and LIBOR/IBOR rates.
For Level 2 interest rate derivatives, the measurement of fair value involves comparing the fixed interest rate with the swap rates as at the balance sheet date or with the yield curve relevant for the maturity. The fair value is obtained from a separate calculation provided by banking institutions.
In measuring the fair values of bank loans and overdrafts, other loans from non-Group entities, and borrowings from affiliated companies in the Südzucker group in Level 2, the terms agreed in the existing financing contracts, such
as the remaining maturity and interest rate, are compared with the current market terms available at the balance sheet date for new financings with the same remaining maturity. The interest rate differential identified in this comparison determines the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.

The fair values of financial instruments were determined on the basis of the market information available at the balance sheet date and using the methods and assumptions outlined below.
Securities held as non-current and current assets include available-for-sale securities. These are measured at current securities exchange prices or market value. Non-current securities (equity instruments) classified as available-for-sale for which no reliable market data are available and for which the fair value could therefore not be reliably determined are measured at cost. The total amount of non-current securities valued at cost is non-material for the Group.
Available-for-sale investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies are measured at cost. These are non-fully-consolidated investments in subsidiaries and interests in non-listed companies for which it was chosen not to determine fair values using discounted future cash flows because this item is of minor significance for the Group.
As a result of the short maturities of the trade receivables, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents, their fair values are assumed to be equivalent to their carrying amounts.
The positive and negative fair values of commodity derivatives relate partly to cash flow hedges. For the interest rate hedges, the fair values are determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured on the basis of reference rates, taking into account forward premiums or discounts. The fair values of interest rate derivatives are obtained from the bank confirmations as at the balance sheet date. These fair values represent the present values of the future interest payments based on the yield curves used. The fair values of commodity derivatives are based on official quotations on futures exchanges. The market rates (fair values) of currency derivatives are based
on the forward rates determined by AGRANA as at the balance sheet date and on the hedged exchange rates. The interest rates and exchange rates used for the determination of the forward rates are based on the reference rates published by the ECB or the national central banks. In some cases, as a result of differences in interest rates, the fair values determined by the Group may differ to an insignificant extent from the fair values calculated by the commercial banks that issue the bank confirmations.
For trade payables and current financial other payables, it is assumed in view of the short maturities that the fair values equal the carrying amounts. The fair value of fixed interest liabilities is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows. For variable rate liabilities, the fair value equals the carrying amount.
The net gains and losses on financial instruments are presented by measurement category in the following table:

10.4. Risk management in the AGRANA Group
The AGRANA Group is exposed to market price risks through changes in exchange rates, interest rates and security prices. In the Group’s operating activities, price risks arise largely from the costs of raw materials (mainly sugar beet, sugar purchased in the world market, grains, potatoes, and fruit) and energy, and from selling prices of sugar, starch, ethanol and fruit products. In addition, the Group is exposed to credit risks, associated especially with trade receivables.
AGRANA uses an integrated system for the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the Group. The Group’s proven approach to risk management is guided by the aim of balancing risks and returns. The Group’s risk culture is characterised by risk-aware behaviour, clearly defined responsibilities, independent risk control, and the implementation of internal control systems.
AGRANA regards the responsible management of business risks and opportunities as an important part of sustainable, value-driven corporate governance. Risk management thus forms an integral part of the entire planning, management and reporting process and is directed by the Management Board. The parent company and all subsidiaries employ risk manage- ment systems that are tailored to their respective operating activity. The systems’ purpose is the methodical identification, assessment, control and documenting of risks.
In a three-pronged approach, risk management at the AGRANA Group is based on risk control at the operational level, on strategic control of Group companies by the Group, and on an internal monitoring system delivered by the Group’s internal audit department. In addition, emerging trends that could develop into threats to the viability of the AGRANA Group as
a going concern are identified and analysed at an early stage and continually re-evaluated as part of the risk management process.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of an economic loss as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its payment obligations. Credit risk includes both the risk of a deterioration in customers’ or other counterparties’ credit quality, and the risk of their immediate default.
The trade receivables of the AGRANA Group are largely with the food, chemical and retail industries. Credit risk in respect of trade receivables is managed on the basis of internal standards and guidelines. Thus, a credit analysis is generally con- ducted for new customers. The Group also uses credit insurance and security such as bank guarantees.
For the residual risk from trade receivables, the Group establishes provisions for impairment.
The net carrying amount of trade receivables after provisions for impairment is determined as follows:
€000
Carrying amount of trade receivables, gross Provisions for impairment of trade receivables Carrying amount, net

     Receivables are as a rule individually reviewed for their collectability and measured on the basis of estimated future cash flows.
The maximum exposure from trade receivables is equivalent to the carrying amount of the trade receivables.
The table below provides information on the credit risks in respect of trade receivables. The maturity profile of trade receivables was as follows:

  AGRANA maintains business relationships with many large international industrial customers having excellent credit ratings.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that a company will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due or in sufficient measure.
The AGRANA Group generates liquidity with its business operations and from external financing. The funds are used to fund working capital, investment and business acquisitions.
153

In order to ensure the Group’s solvency at all times and safeguard its financial flexibility, a liquidity reserve is maintained in the form of credit lines and, to the extent necessary, of cash.
To manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, both short-term and long-term finance is raised in the course of day-to-day financial management.
At the balance sheet date the Group had credit lines with a total limit of € 916,228 thousand (prior year: € 1,011,373 thou- sand). The weighted average remaining maturity of the credit lines at the balance sheet date was 2.9 years (prior year: 2.8 years).
The following maturity profile shows the effects of the cash outflows from liabilities as at 28 February 2018 on the Group’s liquidity situation. All cash outflows are undiscounted.

Currency risk
The Group’s international business operations expose AGRANA to foreign exchange risks from financing and financial investment, from trade receivables and trade payables and from future foreign currency cash flows under purchasing and sales contracts. To measure and control these risks, the AGRANA Group uses Value-at-Risk based on the variance- covariance approach at a 95% confidence level. This involves the measurement of the various currency pairs at the given volatilities and takes into account the correlations between them. The result is stated as diversified Value-at-Risk:

Most of the Group’s foreign exchange risk arises in the operating business, when revenues or costs are denominated
in a currency other than that of the related costs or revenues, respectively The AGRANA Group’s currency risk from financ- ing arises from borrowings and financial investments not denominated in the local currency of the respective company.
The total foreign currency positions of € 107,863 thousand (prior year: € 125,566 thousand) related primarily to Romania, Russia, Argentina and Mexico as well as a US dollar position in the euro area, and represented a Value-at-Risk of € 7,342 thousand (prior year: € 8,373 thousand).
In the Sugar segment, Group companies based in the European Union whose local currency is not the euro are exposed to sugar-regime-induced foreign exchange risk between the euro and their respective local currency, as the beet prices for a given campaign are set in euros EU-wide. The subsidiaries in Romania and Hungary are subject to additional currency risk from raw sugar purchases in US dollars, and some companies are exposed to currency risk from sales of non-quota sugar in US dollars.
In the Starch segment, foreign exchange risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.
In the Fruit segment, foreign exchange risks arise when revenue and materials costs are in foreign currency rather than local currency. In addition, risks arise from borrowings not denominated in local currency.

Interest rate risk
The AGRANA Group is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in the euro zone.
Risks from potential changes in interest rates are reported on an “at risk” basis. AGRANA distinguishes between Cash-Flow-at-Risk (CFaR) for variable rate borrowings and Value-at-Risk (VaR) for changes in market interest rates on fixed rate borrowings.
CFaR: An increase in interest rates would cause an increase in funding costs from variable rate borrowings. The CFaR analysis is based on the volatilities of the individual funding currencies and the correlations between them.
VaR: The analysis examines the implied risk from a decrease in interest rates, as existing fixed rate borrowings would continue to incur interest costs at a constant rate instead of following the market trend. The different maturities of fixed interest borrowings are taken into account through weighted present values and a potential change in variable interest rates under the modified duration approach.
The CFaR and VaR from borrowings were as follows:

  The floating rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. To hedge against this risk, interest rate swaps were entered into for a portion of the borrowings, thus achieving fixed interest rates on this portion.
Commodity price risks
AGRANA’s business activities expose it to market price risk from purchases of commodities and the sale of finished products (ethanol). This is particularly true in the production of bioethanol, where the most important cost factors by far are the prices of the main inputs, corn and wheat. To a lesser but still significant extent, the Sugar segment has exposure to the purchase prices of raw sugar.
At the balance sheet date the Group had open commodity derivative contracts for the purchase of 2,845 tonnes of
raw sugar (prior year: 32,514 tonnes), the purchase of 112,900 tonnes of wheat for the Austrian bioethanol production operations (prior year: 82,750 tonnes), and the purchase of 20,650 tonnes of corn (prior year: 0 tonnes), and for the sale of 3,250 tonnes of corn (prior year: 3,800 tonnes) and the sale of 500 tonnes of white sugar (prior year: 17,850 tonnes). These positions represented an aggregate contract amount of € 24,494 thousand (prior year: € 36,895 thousand) and, based on the underlying closing prices, had a combined net negative fair value of € 922 thousand (prior year: negative fair value of € 150 thousand).
Legal risks
AGRANA continually monitors changes in the legal setting relevant to its businesses or to their employees that
could lead to a risk situation, and takes risk management actions as necessary. Areas of law to which particular attention is devoted are anti-trust, food and environmental legislation, as well as data protection, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism finance provisions. AGRANA maintains dedicated staff positions for matters of compliance, employment law and general areas of law.
There are currently no pending or threatened civil actions against companies of the AGRANA Group that could have a material impact on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

As noted in previous annual reports, the Austrian Federal Competition Authority in 2010 sought a fine under an antitrust case for alleged competition-restricting arrangements with respect to Austria filed against AGRANA Zucker GmbH, Vienna, and Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany. To date the Cartel Court has not ruled on the case. AGRANA continues to regard the allegation as unfounded and the fine sought as unwarranted.

       At the balance sheet date, borrowings from related parties amounted to € 151,343 thousand (prior year: € 258,171 thou- sand); these borrowings were on normal commercial terms. Of this total, € 115,000 thousand represented non-current borrowings (prior year: € 115,000 thousand).
For fully consolidated subsidiaries, the Group issued guarantees in favour of companies with significant influence
of € 5,000 thousand (prior year: € 5,000 thousand), of which an amount of € 209 thousand (prior year: € 634 thousand) was utilised.
The remuneration of the members of the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG totalled € 3,488 thousand (prior year: € 3,234 thousand), consisting of total fixed base salaries of € 1,674 thousand (prior year: € 1,614 thousand),
a total performance-based, variable component of € 1,778 thousand (prior year: € 1,495 thousand) and a long-service award to Fritz Gattermayer of € 36 thousand (prior year: Johann Marihart, € 125 thousand). The performance-based elements
of the compensation are linked to the amount of the dividend paid for the last three financial years. The Management Board member of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG appointed on the basis of the syndicate agreement between Südzucker AG, Mannheim, Germany, and Zucker-Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H, Vienna, does not receive compensation for serving
on the Management Board.
On 7 July 2017 the Annual General Meeting approved an annual aggregate remuneration for the Supervisory Board
of € 250 thousand (prior year: € 250 thousand) and delegated to the Supervisory Board Chairman the responsibility for allocating this sum. The amount paid to the individual Supervisory Board members is tied to their function on the Board. No meeting fees were paid in the year under review.

Post-employment benefits granted to the Management Board members Johann Marihart and Fritz Gattermayer and
the former Management Board member Walter Grausam under the Company’s plan are pension, disability insurance and survivor benefits. The pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the Austrian public pension scheme (ASVG) are met. The amount of the pension is calculated as a percentage of a contractually agreed assessment base. In the event of early retirement within ASVG rules, the amount of the pension is reduced. For the pension of Stephan Büttner there is a defined contribution obligation, which can be claimed after the recipient has reached 55 years of age if the employment contract has been terminated by the employer. For the 2017|18 financial year, pension fund contributions of € 352 thousand were paid (prior year: € 354 thousand). A follow-up payment of € 109 thousand was made to former Chief Financial Officer Walter Grausam, who retired on 31 December 2014.
The retirement benefit obligations in respect of the Management Board are administered by an external pension fund.
In the balance sheet at 28 February 2018, within the item “retirement and termination benefit obligations”, an amount of € 6,874 thousand was recognised for pension obligations (prior year: € 8,496 thousand) and an amount of € 2,283 thousand was recognised for termination benefit obligations (prior year: € 2,151 thousand).
In the event that a Management Board appointment is withdrawn, there are severance pay obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Act or the Occupational Pension Plan Act.
Information on the Management Board and Supervisory Board is provided on page 161.
On 23 April 2018 the Management Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG released the consolidated financial statements for review by the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee and for presentation to the Annual General Meeting and subsequent publication.

Independent auditor’s report
[Translation]
Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements
Audit Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft, Vienna, Austria and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the Consolidated balance sheet as at 28 February 2018, and the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated cash flow statement
and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as of 28 February 2018, and its consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code).
Basis for our Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the EU Regulation 537/2014 (“EU Regulation”) and Austrian Standards on Auditing. These standards require the audit to be conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities” section of our report. We are independent of the audited Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and professional regulations, and we have fulfilled our other responsibilities under those relevant ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, however, we do not provide a separate opinion thereon.
Impairment of Goodwill
The Management Board provides an explanation of goodwill and the procedure for performing impairment tests under Point 6.1 and Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Risk for the Financial Statements
As at 28 February 2018, goodwill in total accounts for € 261.0 million or 11.1% of the total assets.
Goodwill depicts into the cash generating units (CGUs) Fruit, Sugar and Starch. The Company performs impairment testing on these CGUs whenever triggering events are identified but at least on an annual basis. The annual impairment tests are performed at the end of the second quarter of every financial year (31 August). On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses whether objective evidence of an impairment exists. In those cases where such triggering events are identified additional impairment tests are performed.
The company calculates the values in use based on a discounted cash flow method as benchmark for impairment testing. This valuation method is significantly influenced by the assumptions and estimates in respect of the future cash flows. These are derived from the forecast figures approved by the respective management bodies and may be subject to adjust- ments if necessary. The discount rates applied in the method are also influenced by future changes in market, economic and legal environment. Consequentially the values in use are based on judgment and associated with estimate uncertain- ties and thus lead to a risk that the goodwill reported in the financial statements may be overstated.
Our Response
We have assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methods and of the assumption in respect to the forecasts and valuation parameters applied. We hereby consulted with our valuation specialists. When assessing the valuation method applied we followed the model and analysed whether it is adequate for accurately determining the value in use. We further have re-performed the determination of the discount rates and assessed the parameters applied in terms of their appropriateness through comparison with market and industry-specific benchmarks.
163

164
The forecasting accuracy has been assessed by the Company by back testing the underlying forecast figures. We have assessed the conclusions drawn with regard to the adequacy of the forecasted figures applied in the impairment tests.
We have reconciled the cash flows used in the impairment tests with the forecasted figures approved by the management bodies, assessed any adjustments made thereto, and analysed their adequacy.
For assessing whether event driven impairment tests are necessary, we have analysed the processes used to identify objective evidence of impairments, as well as the controls established in this connection, as to whether these are appro- priate to detect evidence of impairments in a timely manner. Furthermore, we have evaluated the results of the company internal assessment for objective evidence of impairments.
Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and the additional require- ments pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Management is also responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless management either intents to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement – whether due to fraud or error – and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinion. Reasonable assurance represents a high level of assurance, but provides no guarantee that an audit con- ducted in accordance with the EU Regulation and Austrian Standards on Auditing (and therefore ISAs), will always detect a material misstatement, if any. Misstatements may result from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with the EU Regulation and Austrian Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
Moreover:
█ We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, we design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to serve as a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatements resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or override of internal control.
█ We obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appro- priate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

█ We evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
█ We conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our audit report to the respective note in the consolidated financial statements. If such disclosures are not appropriate, we will modify our audit opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
█ We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
█ We obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
█ We communicate with the audit committee regarding, amongst other matters, the planned scope and timing of
our audit as well as significant findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
█ We communicate to the audit committee that we have complied with the relevant professional requirements in respect
of our independence, that we will report any relationships and other events that could reasonably affect our independence and, where appropriate, the related safeguards.
█ From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit i.e. key audit matters. We describe these key audit matters in our auditor’s report unless laws or other legal regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when in very rare cases, we determine that a matter should not be included in our audit report because the negative consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal Requirements
Group Management Report
In accordance with the Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the group management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and prepared in accordance with legal require- ments. It is our responsibility to determine whether the consolidated non-financial statement has been prepared as part of the group management report, to read and assess whether, based on knowledge gained during our audit, it contains any material inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements or any apparent material misstatement of fact.
Management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report in accordance with the Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Independent auditor’s report
165

Statement
Based on our knowledge gained in the course of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and our under- standing of the Group and its environment, we did not note any material misstatements in the group management report.
Other Information
Management is responsible for other information. Other information is all information provided in the annual report, other than the consolidated financial statements, the group management report and the auditor’s report. We expect the annual report to be provided to us after the date of the auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover other information and we do not provide any kind of assurance thereon.
In conjunction with our audit, it is our responsibility to read this other information as soon as it becomes available,
to assess whether, based on knowledge gained during our audit, it contains any material inconsistencies with the consoli- dated financial statements or any apparent material misstatement of fact.
Additional Information in accordance with Article 10 EU Regulation
At the Annual General Meeting dated 7 July 2017, we were elected as group auditors. We were appointed by the Super- visory Board on 4 December 2017. We have been the Group’s auditors from the year ended 30 September 1995, without interruption.
We declare that our opinion expressed in the “Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our report is consistent with our additional report to the Audit Committee, in accordance with Article 11 EU Regulation.
We declare that we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services (Article 5 Paragraph 1 EU Regulation) and that we have ensured our independence throughout the course of the audit, from the audited Group.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
 This report is a translation of the original report in German, which is solely valid.
The consolidated financial statements together with our auditor’s opinion may only be published if the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are identical with the audited version attached to this report.

Independent Assurance Report
on the Consolidated Non-financial Statement as well as the Sustainability Disclosures and Indicators in the Integrated Annual Report for the 2017|18 Financial Year
We have performed an independent assurance on the consolidated non-financial statement as well as the sustainability disclosures and indicators in the Integrated Annual Report (the “NFI reporting”) for the 2017|18 financial year of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG (“the Company”).
Management’s Responsibility
The legal representatives of AGRANA are responsible for the proper preparation of the consolidated non-financial state- ment in accordance with the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB) as well as the proper preparation of the Integrated Report in accordance with the reporting criteria. The Company applies
the sustainability reporting guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards, “Core” option) as reporting criteria.
The responsibility of the legal representatives of the company includes the selection and application of reasonable methods for sustainability reporting as well as the use of assumptions and estimates for individual non-financial disclosures
that are reasonable under the circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the sustainability reporting in a way that is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to state whether, based on our procedures performed, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFI-reporting of the Company is not in accordance with the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB) and the sustainability reporting guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards, “Core” option) in all material respects.
Our engagement was conducted in conformity with Austrian Standards for independent assurance engagements (KFS/PG 13) and in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000) applicable to such engage- ments. These standards require us to comply with our professional requirements including independence requirements, and to plan and perform the engagement to enable us to express a conclusion with limited assurance, taking into account materiality.
An independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with limited assurance is substantially less in scope than an independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with reasonable assurance, thus providing reduced assurance.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment and included the following procedures in particular:
█ Inquiries of personnel on corporate level, which are responsible for the materiality analysis, in order to gain
an understanding of the processes for determining material sustainability topics and respective reporting boundaries of the Company;
█ Risk assessment, including a media analysis on relevant information concerning the sustainability performance of the Company in the reporting period;
█ Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for the collection, processing and control of the disclosures on environmental, social and employees matters, respect for human rights and anti-corruption and bribery, including the consolidation of the data;
█ Inquiries of personnel on corporate level responsible for providing and consolidating and for carrying out internal control procedures concerning the disclosures on concepts, risks, due diligence processes, results and performance indicators;
167

█ Inspection of selected internal and external documents in order to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;
█ Visit to AGRANA Fruit GmbH (Gleisdorf, Austria) to gain an understanding of the value creation processes
in the segment of fruit, to assess local data collection and reporting processes and the reliability of the reported data.
█ Inquiries of personnel of the production site in Ohio, USA, by videoconference to assess local data collection and reporting processes and the reliability of the reported environmental data.
█ Analytical evaluation of the data and trend explanations of quantitative disclosures, submitted by all sites for consolidation at corporate level;
█ Evaluation of the consistency of the disclosures and indicators of the NFI reporting with the requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB) applicable to the Company and with the GRI Standards (“Core” option);
█ Evaluation of the overall presentation of the disclosures;
The procedures that we performed do not constitute an audit or a review. Our engagement did not focus on revealing and clarifying of illegal acts such as fraud, nor did it focus on assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of manage- ment. Furthermore, it is not part of our engagement to review future-related disclosures and statements from external information sources and expert opinions.
This assurance report is issued based on the assurance agreement concluded with the Company. Our responsibility
and liability towards the Company and any third party is subject to paragraph 8 of the General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions. The respective latest version of the AAB is accessible at http://www.kpmg.at/aab.
Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFI-reporting of the Company is not in accordance with the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB) and the sustainability reporting guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards, “Core” option) in all material respects.

Glossary of industry and trade terms
A
ActiProt®: AGRANA’s own brand of high-protein animal feed. This form of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) is a by-product of bioethanol production from cereals, obtained by drying the mash (the residue from distillation). The DDGS is pelleted and marketed as a non-perishable feedstuff. With its high protein content of at least 30% and its valuable energy content, DDGS
is a sought-after feed for livestock, particularly dairy animals. In the AGRANA Group this co-product is generated in the bioethanol plant in Pischelsdorf, Austria, which typically processes corn, wheat, triticale and molasses. Like all other products marketed by AGRANA, ActiProt® is GMO-free.
B
Biodiversity: Biodiversity, or biological diversity, by
the definition of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is “the variability among living organisms from
all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine
and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological comp- lexes of which they are part”. This includes diversity within species, diversity between species and diversity of ecosystems. The preservation and sustainable use of biological diversity are considered important foundations of human wellbeing. The destruction and fragmenta- tion of habitats is viewed as the greatest threat to the diversity of life on earth.
Bioethanol: Bioethanol is a fuel manufactured by the fermentation of carbohydrate-containing biomass (renew- able carbon sources). It has a minimum alcohol content of 99% by volume and contains effectively no water.
In Europe, for climate reasons, bioethanol is produced mainly from starch-containing grain crops or from sugar beet. Unlike fossil fuels, bioethanol is CO2 neutral, and its physical properties differ from those of petrol. Its use as a petrol substitute in more or less undiluted form
(in so-called high blends) therefore requires modifications to engines. For low blends (such as E10), engine modifica- tion is not needed.
Biogas: Biogas contains methane as a combustible component, which is manufactured through the zymosis of biomass in biogas facilities and is used for the generation of bioenergy. Biogas can be acquired from fermentable recycling material that contains biomass, such as sewage sludge, biowaste or food waste, liquid and solid farmyard manure, or also from energy crops that have been planted specifically for this purpose,
i.e., renewable raw materials.
C
Campaign: The processing period for agricultural raw materials that have a limited storage life.
Cane sugar: Sugar produced from sugar cane. Chemically identical to beet sugar.
Corn starch: Starch produced from corn (maize), used especially as an ingredient in foods (such as puddings), but also in industrial applications, such as in paper products and cosmetics.
CO2 equivalent: To make the greenhouse effect of differ- ent greenhouse gases comparable and calculable, their global warming potential is used. It indicates the con- tribution of a gas to the heating of the earth’s atmosphere by assigning an equivalent volume of CO2. The green- house effect per kilogram of a given gas is expressed as a multiple (“equivalent factor”) of the greenhouse effect
of one kilogram of carbon dioxide.
Customs duties: Also known as import duties or customs tariffs, these help to protect domestic products against cheap imports from non-EU countries (thus providing tariff protection). The basic import duty for sugar is
a fixed amount. In addition, a special safeguard provision provides for a higher tariff when sugar imports exceed a certain quantity.
173

174
D
Deficit countries/markets/regions: Countries,
markets or regions that consume more sugar than they produce and which therefore cover their needs through sugar imports.
E
Emission: Generally signifies the release of noxious substances such as pollutants or greenhouse gases into the environment. A typical example are car exhaust fumes.
Ethanol: Ethanol is a form of alcohol and is a clear, flammable liquid. It is also known as pure alcohol, grain alcohol or drinking alcohol, and is found in drinks
such as wine and beer. In recent years, ethanol has acquired great importance outside the beverage industry as a biofuel referred to as bioethanol. See bioethanol.
EU sugar regime: See sugar regime. F
Fermentation: In the context of biotechnology, fermen- tation (zymosis) means the conversion of biological material through the addition of enzymes (known as
“ferment”) or in the presence of bacterial, fungal or cell cultures.
F. O. Licht: A leading private-sector source of analysis on the global markets for sugar, ethanol, molasses, feed additives, biofuels, coffee and tea, F. O. Licht publishes
a wide range of print reports and organises conferences for the sugar and ethanol industries.
Fruit juice concentrate: Forming the basis for fruit
juice drinks, fruit juice concentrates are sold into the fruit juice and beverage industry. The same quantity of water carefully removed from the pressed fruit juice is later added to the concentrate again to create the end product for consumption. The result is high-quality juice with 100% fruit content.
Fruit preparations: Sometimes referred to as fruit ingredients. High-quality fruit is prepared in liquid or piece form and thermally preserved for further process- ing, especially for use by the dairy, ice-cream and bakery industries.
G
GMO: Genetically modified organisms are organisms whose genetic material has been altered through genetic engineering.
I
IGC (International Grains Council): The International Grains Council is an intergovernmental organisation concerned with grains trade. Since 1995 the London-based IGC also administers the Grains Trade Convention, an international agreement. The IGC Secretariat provides both administrative support to the Council, and services to the Food Aid Committee established under the Food Aid Convention of 1999. The IGC’s grain market studies are widely used in sector and market research.
ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation):
The International Organisation for Standardisation (widely known as ISO) is the leading international asso- ciation of national standard-setting bodies and develops international standards in all areas but electricity and electronics, which are the responsibility of the Inter- national Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and telecommunication, which is the province of the Inter- national Telecommunication Union (ITU). Together, these three organisations form the World Standards Coopera- tion, or WSC.
Other information

Isoglucose: Isoglucose, a liquid, is a sweetener based
on starch that has been converted to sugar. At a fructose content of 42%, it has the same sweetness as sugar
and is therefore used as a sugar substitute. The fructose content can be raised to as much as 55% through further process stages. Isoglucose is manufactured from grains, especially corn.
M
Marketing year for grains: This period runs from July to June of the following year.
Molasses: Sweet, dark-brown by-product of sugar manu- facturing, with the consistency of syrup. It still contains about 50% sugar, which cannot be further crystallised. Molasses is used predominantly in the manufacture of yeast and alcohol, and as a cattle feed supplement.
Minimum price for sugar beet (applied until 30 Sep- tember 2017): The EU sugar regime sets a minimum price for quota beets specific to a certain delivery stage and quality standard. For other delivery terms or quality levels, price adjustments are made.
Modified starch: Modified starches are obtained by physical, enzymatic or chemical processes and are starch products that meet higher technological requirements. Important properties remain intact after modification. Modified starches are used in the food industry and in industrial applications where they are superior to natural starch in qualities such as stability against heat and acidity, shear strength, and freezing and thawing proper- ties. Modified starches used as food additives must be declared as such if they are chemically changed. Other- wise – if modified physically (through heat or pressure) or enzymatically – they are considered food ingredients and have no E number.
N
Native starch: See starch.
Non-quota sugar (applied until 30 September 2017): Under the EU sugar regime, non-quota sugar is sugar that exceeds the production quota. This can be marketed as industrial (non-food) sugar for use primarily in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry (e.g., to produce yeast, citric acid and vitamins), or can be exported
into non-EU countries or carried over to the next sugar marketing year.
P
Prime Market: A subsegment of the “equity market.at” market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange. The Prime Market comprises the shares of companies admitted to listing in the Official Market or Second Regulated Market and meeting the special additional requirements for admission to the Prime Market. These securities are traded via the Xetra trading system using the Continuous Trading procedure, in conjunction with auctions.
Production levy (applied until 30 September 2017):
The production levy for sugar quotas is € 12 per tonne. From the 2007|08 sugar marketing year, up to one-half of the levy can be paid by the sugar beet farmers.
For isoglucose, the amount of the levy is 50% of that for sugar. The production levy is an administrative tax paid to the EU.
Production quota (applied until 30 September 2017): See sugar quota.
Q
Quota (applied until 30 September 2017): See sugar quota.
Quota sugar (applied until 30 September 2017): The amount of sugar produced and marketed in the course of a sugar marketing year within the allotted production quota.
Glossary of industry and trade terms

Quota sugar beets (applied until 30 September 2017): The amount of sugar beet necessary to fully utilise the production quota for sugar.
R
“Ramsar Convention” on wetlands: The Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971) – called the “Ramsar Convention” – is an intergovernmental treaty that embodies the commitments of its member countries to maintain the ecological character of their Wetlands
of International Importance and to plan for the “wise”, or sustainable, use of all of the wetlands in their territories.
Raw sugar: Raw sugar is a semi-finished form of cane sugar (or of beet sugar) in which the sugar crystals are not yet completely freed from the adhering non-sugar materials, which give it its brown colour.
Refining: The term “refining” in its general sense
refers to a technical process for the cleaning, processing, separation or concentration of raw materials. In the case of sugar, it means the de-coloration of brown raw sugar (from sugar cane or sugar beet) through repeated recrystallisation.
S
Starch: Starch is an organic compound and one of the most important energy storage materials in plant cells. In our latitudes, starch is mainly acquired from corn, wheat or potatoes. To extract starch, the starch-contain- ing parts of the plants are milled to a small size
and the starch is washed out. Through filtration and centrifugation steps, the starch is extracted. After the final stage of drying, native starch emerges from the process as a white powder.
Sugar: In Europe, sugar is produced from sugar beet. In sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world, sugar cane is the main raw material for sugar production. The term
“sugar” in general usage typically refers to granulated sugar, i.e., sucrose. However, there are several other types of sugar, including glucose, fructose and lactose, among others. All are part of the carbohydrate food group.
Sugar beet: Sugar beet is an agricultural crop grown almost exclusively for sugar production. The sugar beet plant consists of the leaves and a large, fleshy root. The root stores sucrose, which is extracted in the sugar factory.
Sugar marketing year (SMY): The sugar marketing year of the European Union begins on 1 October and ends on 30 September of the following year. This definition applies for all regulations of the EU sugar market.
Sugar production: In sugar production from sugar beet, raw juice is extracted from the sugar beet slices. The juice is then cleaned in several stages and even- tually thickened until sugar crystallises from it. Through repeated recrystallisation, the sugar is purified to produce clean, white crystals. These crystals have a sucrose content of very close to 100%. That makes
sugar an extremely pure food product with an almost unlimited shelf life.
Sugar quota (applied until 30 September 2017): Under the EU sugar regime, a production quota for sugar and isoglucose is set for every EU member state that produces sugar. Each national quota is apportioned among the respective country’s sugar-producing companies as their individual production quota. This restricts production volumes and minimises surpluses.
Other information

Sugar regime (EU sugar policy): In place since 1968,
the European Union’s sugar regulatory framework serves to organise the EU common market for sugar and ensure security of intra-EU sugar production.
On 26 June 2013 the European Parliament and European Council reached an agreement to extend the rules of
the then-current sugar market policy for a final time, to 30 September 2017. For the era after this expiration
date, sweeping changes were decided that have by now come into force. National sugar quotas and minimum beet prices, which for many years had formed the central features of the old market regime, are no longer part of EU sugar policy since 1 October 2017.
Since that date, the sugar-specific rules of the EU’s agricultural policy involve the following elements:
█ Preferential imports from various countries, includ- ing unlimited duty-free imports from the Least Developed Countries and the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) Group of States, as well as duty-free or reduced-duty import quotas under free trade agreements; imports from other non-EU countries are subject to the normal duty rate
█ Possibility of private storage aid, at the discretion of the European Commission, which in its decision takes into account the reference thresholds for white and raw sugar
█ Requirement to conclude sector-wide master agree- ments between beet growers and sugar companies
█ Official price reporting of the European Commission
After the end of the production quotas and minimum beet prices, and with export subsidies having been discon- tinued many years ago, the sugar policy of the European Union is thus limited to protecting the EU market from subsidised imports and to employing private storage
aid. Protection against unfair competition is of vital importance to the European sugar industry, as nearly all major sugar producing countries subsidise their produc- tion. Private storage aid may be granted, by order
of the European Commission. Its purpose is to counteract price erosion in the internal market triggered by market imbalances.
As a result of the restriction of the EU’s sugar policy
to these instruments, combined with the opening of the single market to sugar imports from numerous other countries, particularly many developing economies,
the European Union today has one of the most liberal sugar markets in the world.
T
Triticale: As a hybrid grain resulting from the crossing
of wheat and rye, triticale combines the characteristics of both these grains in terms of flavour and composition. Thanks to its higher starch content, triticale is also used as an energy crop for the production of bioethanol.
W
West Balkan Agreement: Since autumn 2000 the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia may import limited quantities of duty-free sugar (among other products) into the EU. The EU has since then concluded corresponding free trade agreements with Croatia and Serbia.
White sugar: Also called granulated or table sugar, white sugar is produced by crystallisation and centrifugation.
WTO (World Trade Organisation): In the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation, its currently 159 member states negotiate the liberalisation of World Trade.

All AGRANA sites are covered by the AGRANA Code of Conduct, which affirms the right to free association and collective bargaining. AGRANA sites perform an annual SEDEX self-assessment. Additionally in the year under review, 29 external social audits were performed at AGRANA sites (see 412-1), which includes auditing for this potential issue. In the Sugar and Starch segments, which operate in the EU and Europe, the risk in the supply chain is classified as low, as most contract growers are sole proprietors. The globally operating fruit preparations business uses SEDEX for supplier assessment to evaluate this risk and,
where appropriate, to take action.

Child labour
408-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of child labour
All AGRANA sites are covered by the AGRANA Code of Conduct, which prohibits child labour. AGRANA sites perform an annual SEDEX self-assessment. Additionally in the year under review, 29 external social audits were performed at AGRANA sites (see 412-1), which includes auditing for this potential issue. In the Sugar and Starch segments, which operate in the EU and Europe, the risk of child labour in the supply chain is classified as low, as a result of the strong regulatory environment and very high degree of mechanisation. The globally operating fruit preparations business uses SEDEX for supplier assessment (especially in higher-risk countries) in order to reduce this risk.
Forced or compulsory labour
409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labour
All AGRANA sites and suppliers are subject to the AGRANA Code of Conduct and perform an annual SEDEX self-assessment. Additionally in the year under review, 29 external social audits were performed at AGRANA sites (see 412-1), which includes auditing for this potential issue. In the Sugar and Starch segments, which operate in the EU and Europe, the risk in the supply chain is classified as low, as a result of the strong regulatory environ- ment and very high degree of mechanisation. The globally operating fruit preparations business uses SEDEX
for supplier assessment (especially in higher-risk countries such as Vietnam, Morocco and the Philippines) in order to reduce this risk.

Forward-looking statements
This annual report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions and estimates made by the Manage- ment Board of AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG. Although these assumptions, plans and projections represent the Management Board’s current intentions and best knowledge, a large number of internal and external factors may cause actual future developments and results to differ materially from these assumptions and estimates. Some examples of such factors are, without limitation: negotiations concerning world trade agreements; changes in the overall economic environment, especially in macroeconomic variables such as exchange rates, inflation and interest rates; EU sugar policy; consumer behaviour; and public policy related to food and energy. AGRANA Beteiligungs-AG does not guarantee in any way that the actual future developments and actual future results achieved will match the assumptions and estimates expressed or made in this annual report, and does not accept any liability in the event that assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect.
The quantitative statements and direction arrows in the “Outlook” section of this report are based on the following definitions:
