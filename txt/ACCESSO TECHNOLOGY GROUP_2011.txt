Lo-Q plc Chairman's Report for the year ending 31 October 2011 Chairman's Report These results demonstrate nothing short of an excellent year for Lo-Q in 2011. Despite the continuing challenge of global economic conditions, with theme park attendances being slightly lower than in 2010, Lo-Q's revenues, profits and cash have each exceeded both our own and the market's expectations. Operationally and strategically the year has seen many positive and exciting initiatives take shape, each of which will play an important role in Lo-Q's future growth. Our product development and operational teams have demonstrated the technical and commercial opportunity for Qband, our water park product. Following a successful trial at Six Flags White Water in the United States we are delighted to have signed contracts for the installation of our Q-band product at ten water parks in time for the 2012 season. This is a significant achievement, coming so soon after the initial launch of this solution in June. I also remain confident that our continued investment in the development of smartphone solutions will undoubtedly widen our market opportunity globally. We were proud and delighted that our international expansion has been recognised in the shape of a Queen's Award for International Trade. Achievements of this kind result from the considerable efforts of our global Lo-Q team, each of whom has worked hard to make 2011 a record year. Their energy, enthusiasm and innovative spirit is a real asset to Lo-Q and on behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I thank them for their efforts. With new parks to install and operate, those efforts will need to be maintained in 2012. The year ahead will be one of yet more opportunity for Lo-Q as we start to see the benefits of the initiatives put in place in late 2011. The installation of Lo-Q technology in our recently contracted new parks will undoubtedly test our service organisation, but progress is already well underway. Given the strength of our team, our product line-up and a very healthy sales pipeline, I am confident that we can continue to generate premium growth and will continue improving guest experiences at more theme and water parks around the world. John Weston Non-Executive Chairman

Lo-Q plc Chief Executive Officer's Report for the year ending 31 October 2011
Delivering on our objectives
Having joined the Company in October 2010, this represents my first full year as Chief Executive of Lo-Q. Early on in my tenure, I set our team a number of objectives: to energise sales efforts, to launch new products, and to make in-roads into complementary markets adjacent to our theme park core. Each one of these objectives, I felt, was important if we were to fully capitalise on the exciting opportunities our technology opens up. I am delighted to report that we have delivered on each objective and additionally achieved a strong financial performance.
Despite the tough underlying economic conditions we were able to deliver a 16.4 percent increase in profit before tax, rising to £2.7m (2010: £2.3m). This strong profit performance was supported by revenue growth of 20.9 percent, rising to £24.5m (2010: £20.3m). Additionally, we have been able to end the year with a strong net cash position of £7.5m, up 25% from the 2010 figure of £6.0m whilst maintaining our investment in research and development and expansion of the business.
Underpinning these excellent figures has been the continued consumer usage of our solutions. This year we recorded a 17 percent year-on-year increase in average park guest spend on our products. With the benefit of additional deployments of our Q-bot product, over 1.2m guests used a Lo-Q product in 2011, a nine percent increase, which against the backdrop of a three percent decline in like-for-like park attendances, we are particularly proud of.
Transforming our operations and reach
This year has seen the benefit of our investment in sales and marketing talent and discipline. The Company already maintains strong relationships with the theme park operators, with which it partners, helping them to improve and enhance the visitor experience for their guests. During the year, these relationships have been extended or strengthened by new park installations and by the successful extension of our contractual relationship with Dollywood for a further three years.
This momentum has continued, post period-end. Perhaps the strongest signal so far of this momentum came in November, when our agreement to supply our Q-bot solution to Six Flags, our largest customer, was extended to the end of 2017.
During the year we have invested in building a robust sales pipeline which reflects the strength of our core product set and post period end we have been able to announce a further Q-bot win at LEGOLAND Deutschland.
The pattern of contract wins is a reflection of the trading year of our customers. Typically, they and we direct our focus in the summer season delivering excellent guest experiences in the parks, and expect to sign new business in the closed season. We are conscious that this seasonality limits the nature and timing of our market updates during the operating season but we will continue to communicate trading performance appropriately.
In December, we took an important step toward enhancing our offering and signed a global partnership with MasterCard. Under the terms of this partnership, Lo-Q will work with MasterCard to develop a new contactless payment solution that combines MasterCard's Tap & GoTM PayPassTM payments technology with Lo-Q's innovative queuing software and systems. This represents an exciting, long-term opportunity for us to further enhance the value of our solutions and we are proud to be associated with such a large, blue-chip global brand.
Targeting new opportunities
Operationally, the Company has continued to develop new and innovative products and solutions, using them to make important first steps in to adjacent target markets where Lo-Q technology has the potential to enhance both visitor experience and operator returns.
The most notable example of this is our Q-band product, launched during the year and designed specifically for use in the adjacent water park market. The product returned such impressive initial results from its first trial that Six Flags, the operator that hosted the trial has since engaged us to roll out the system in its nine water parks across North America for a six year term. This resoundingly positive endorsement by the world's largest regional theme park operator underpins our confidence in the product, its potential and our ability to target the water park market opportunity successfully over the medium to long term. In addition, Q-band is currently being installed at Palace Entertainments' "Splish Splash" water park in Long Island. This is good early progress for a new, emerging product and we will continue to focus hard on its development in the year ahead.

Lo-Q plc Chief Executive Officer's Report for the year ending 31 October 2011
This year's progress is demonstrative of the prioritised product development roadmap for our Company. The early success seen with our smartphone-based solution is another example of this. As announced post period-end, the Company has signed a twelve-week pilot for its innovative smartphone-based solution with one of London's best known attractions. This trial, the first of its kind in the UK, represents an important technological advancement for the Company as well as an exciting first step towards extending Lo-Q's offering outside of its core theme park base and into the promising `single line' attraction vertical, which includes a large range of potential future customers including popular tourist sites, sport stadiums, festivals, concerts, museums and special exhibitions.
In the year ahead we plan to trial the delivery of our Q-bot system on guests' smartphones in a North American park. This is an important development, both for opportunities in our current core geographies and as we devote increasing attention to opportunity in Asia. We will also continue to develop our mobile ticketing, payments and scheduling software capability as we look to develop further business in `single-line' attractions and in adjacent markets.
Board Changes
In May, we welcomed John Weston as our Non-Executive Chairman. His appointment, together with the arrival of David Gammon as Non-Executive Director, has strengthened the Board and both have made significant contributions since joining the Board.
Our People
I would like to echo the Chairman's comments and recognise the commitment and hard work of the permanent team and seasonal staff that we employ across our operation. Without their unfailing enthusiasm and hard work, the performance demonstrated this year would be impossible.
As an incentive and to reward employees for their loyalty to the Company, additional share option schemes have been established.
In addition, as announced in March 2011, the remuneration committee of the board recommended, and the board approved, an incentive arrangement to establish an employee benefit trust. The impact of this type of senior management incentive arrangement has brought forward share dilution versus an option only incentive scheme and this explains the reduction in Earnings Per Share for the year.
FTSE Reclassification
Earlier this year, FTSE agreed that it was more appropriate for Lo-Q to be classified as a Software company within the Software sector. This change took effect from Monday 20 June 2011.
Dividend
As consistently communicated, it is the view of the Board that the payment of a dividend is unlikely in the short to medium term, given anticipated new product investment or deployment and other investment opportunities.
Summary and Outlook for 2012
2011 was an excellent year for Lo-Q. We delivered significant progress from existing installations, announced long term contracted commitments in relation to existing and new products and established important beachheads in new markets. In short, we have achieved every single objective we set for ourselves at the start of the year. The strategic initiatives implemented will provide the framework for longer term progress and the hard work and determination of the team together with the continued development of innovative new products has created a strong platform on which to build in 2012.
Notwithstanding the challenges of opening 11 new operations around the world, I am confident that we have initiated the momentum that will define our future business

Lo-Q plc Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 October 2011 The directors present their report with the financial statements of the company and the Group for the year ended 31 October 2011. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY The principal activity of the Group in the period under review was that of development and application of virtual queuing technologies. The Group made a Profit before tax of £2,701,515. After taxation a sum of £1,940,819 has been transferred to retained earnings. The Group will continue to develop, market, sell, and operate its virtual queuing technologies. REVIEW OF BUSINESS The results for the period and financial position of the company and the group are as shown in the annexed financial statements and explained in the Chairman's report and CEO's statement. DIVIDENDS No dividends will be proposed for the year ended 31 October 2011. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS The Group has a very seasonal cash flow due to its income arising largely from park operations, through the daily renting of Q-bots to park guests. Park attendances peak in the summer months, and so income peaks in these months. The Group watches the cash generated during each week's trading in detail and includes this inflow in the weekly production of cash position modelling. Overhead costs are to a large extent known well in advance and are thus very predictable.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Group's research and development activities relate to the development of virtual queuing technologies, by applying state of the art communications and information technology. During the year ended 31 October 2011 the Group invested £694,890 (2010 ­ £807,980) into research and development. DIRECTORS The directors during the period under review were: John Weston, Non-Executive Chairman (appointed 1 May 2011) Tom Burnet, Executive Leonard Sim, Executive John Alder, Executive Anthony Bone, Non-Executive John Lillywhite, Non-Executive David Gammon, Non-Executive (appointed 30 November 2010) Steve Drake, Executive (resigned 30 November 2010) Paul Cassar, Executive (resigned 30 November 2010) Colin Robertson, Executive (resigned 30 November 2010)

Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 October 2011
Corporate Governance
The Company's shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company is not required to report on compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code ("the Code"), the Board of Directors acknowledges the importance of the principles of the Code and also the recommendations of the Quoted Companies Alliance in its publication "Corporate Governance Guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies" and seeks to apply them as appropriate to the Company given its nature and size.
The Board of Directors comprises three executive directors and four independent non-executive directors, one of whom is the Chairman. The Company holds Board meetings regularly throughout the year at which financial and other reports are considered. The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group's strategy, budgets and major items of expenditure.
An Audit Committee has been established comprising John Lillywhite as Chairman, Anthony Bone and David Gammon all non-executive directors. The function of the Committee is to provide formal and transparent arrangements in considering how to apply the financial and reporting arrangements of the Code while maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditors of the Group.
A Remuneration Committee has also been established comprising the following non-executive directors Anthony Bone as Chairman. John Lillywhite, and, David Gammon The Remuneration Committee meets as and when necessary but at least annually to review, inter alia, the performance and salaries of the executive directors and other senior members of the company.
It is considered that the composition and size of the Board does not warrant the appointment of a Nominations Committee and appointments are dealt with by the whole of the Board. The need to appoint such a Committee is subject to review by the Board.
Going Concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. We are confident that the group outlook for 2012 is strong given that the New Year brings a combination of new park signings and the renegotiation of the contact with our major client. Underlying this, the business continues to perform well a strong balance sheet and cash position. For this reason, the board continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Disabled Employees
The Group's policy is one of equal opportunity in the selection, training, career development and promotion of staff. The Group has a policy not to discriminate against disabled employees for those vacancies that they are able to fill and will provide facilities, equipment and training to assist any disabled persons employed.
All necessary assistance with initial training courses will be given. Once employed, a career plan will be developed so as to ensure suitable opportunities for each disabled person. Arrangements will be made, wherever possible, for re-training employees who become disabled, to enable them to perform work identified as appropriate to their aptitudes and abilities.
Employees
The Group's policy is to consult and discuss with employees, by way of meetings and through personal contact by directors and other senior executives, matters likely to affect employees' interests.
Information on matters of concern to employees is given in meetings, handouts, letters and reports, which seek to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees on the financial and economic factors affecting the Group's performance.

Lo-Q plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 October 2011
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
Lo-Q plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly traded on the AIM market. The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Thames House, Portsmouth Road, Esher, Surrey, KT10 9AD.
The financial period represents the 52 weeks and 1 day to 31 October 2011 (prior financial year 52 weeks and 1 day to 31 October 2010). The consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks and 1 day to 31 October 2011 comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries ('Group'). The Group's principal activities are the development and application of virtual queuing technologies.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS'S
The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The principal accounting policies adopted by the group are set out below.
The following new standard have been adopted during the period
It has not been necessary to adopt any new standards during the year ended 31 October 2011.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not effective for 2011 and therefore have not been applied in preparing these accounts. The effective dates shown are for periods commencing on the date quoted.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosures (effective 1 January 2011/July 2011) IFRS 9 Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2013) IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2013) IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective 1 January 2013) IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (effective 1 January 2013) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2011/July 2012) Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes (effective 1 January 2012) Amendment to IAS 12 Employee Benefits (effective 1 January 2013) IAS 24 Related Party transactions (revised) (effective 1 January 2011) IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (reissued) (effective 1 January 2013) IAS 28 Investments in Associates (reissued) (effective 1 January 2013) Amendments to IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting (effective 1 January 2011)
The Group has considered the above new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or that they would not have a significant impact on the Group's Financial Statements, apart from additional disclosures.
Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of Lo-Q plc have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations (IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are noted below.
18

Lo-Q plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 October 2011
Judgement and estimates
The Group makes judgements and assumptions concerning the future that impact the application of policies and reported amounts. The resulting accounting estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results but are based on historical experience and expectations of future events. The judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below.
Impairment of assets
Financial and non-financial assets including other intangibles are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows which includes management assumptions and estimates of future performance.
If there is an indication that impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which this asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of the future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Lo-Q plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings as at 31 October 2011 using the acquisition method of accounting. The results of subsidiary undertakings are included from the date of acquisition.
Disclosure and details of the subsidiaries are provided in note 12.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Lo-Q (Trustees) Limited, a subsidiary company that holds an employee benefit trust on behalf of Lo-Q plc is under control of the Board of Directors and hence has been consolidated into the Group results.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions under IFRS3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
19

Lo-Q plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 October 2011
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The results of subsidiaries are included in the Group income statement from the date of acquisition. Revenue Recognition Turnover arises from the development and application of virtual queuing technologies. Turnover represents either total rentals, net of sales taxes, to theme park or attraction guests or the Group's share of such rental. Total rentals are accounted for where the Group is responsible for the operation within the theme park. Turnover also includes, where applicable, revenue from the financing of installed systems to new or existing theme parks. These systems are then leased back to the Group with the lease costs being recognised within cost of sales during the period or year as they fall due. Interest expense recognition Expense is recognised as interest accrues, using the effective interest method, to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. Employee expenses The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2007. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to full time employees. Equity settled sharebased payments are measured at the fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for all share options in issue. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Commitments under operating leases Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 October 2011

Property, Plant, Equipment and Installed Systems

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or production cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Plant and Machinery Office equipment Installed Systems Furniture and fixtures

33.3% 33.3% 25 ­ 33.3% or life of contract 20.0%

Inventories

Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items.

Stocks are calculated on a first in first out basis.

Park Installations is valued on the basis of the cost of stock items and labour plus attributable overheads.

Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal.

Deferred Tax

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits ("temporary differences") and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Where there are taxable temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities are recognised.

Deferred tax assets are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Where there are deductible temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only where it is probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient tax profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.

Research and development

In accordance with IAS 38 'Intangible Assets', expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as either to a research phase or to a development phase.

All advanced research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. For development expenditure, this is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset, only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.

Development expenditure is capitalised and amortised within administrative expenses on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is considered to be up to a maximum of 5 years.

21

Lo-Q plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 October 2011
Intellectual property rights Intellectual property rights comprise assets acquired relating to know how, patents and licences and have been capitalised at the fair value of the assets acquired and are amortised within administrative expenses on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic life of 5 and 7 years. Foreign currency exchange Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group's overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and movement shown in reserves. Pension Costs Contributions to the Group's defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period/ year in which they become due. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised by the Group and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible or impaired amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when they are identified as being bad. Other receivables are recognised at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits. Short-term deposits are defined as deposits with an initial maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement. Equity Instruments regarding share capital Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Overview:

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments Liquidity risk; Interest rate risk; Credit risk; and Market risk

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks and the Group's policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks. The risks are managed centrally following Board approved policies. The Group operates a centralised treasury function in accordance with Board approved policies and guidelines covering funding and management of foreign exchange exposure and interest rate risk. Transactions entered into by the treasury function are required to be in support of, or as a consequence of, underlying commercial transactions.

Other than short-term trade receivables and trade payables, as detailed in notes that arise directly from operations the Group's financial instruments comprise cash. The fair values of these instruments are not materially different to their book values. The objective of holding financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations and manage related risks. The Group's activities expose the Group to a number of risks including interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and currency risk. The Group manages these risks by regularly monitoring the business and providing ongoing forecasts of the impact on the business.
Liquidity Risk

The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments to ensure it has sufficient funds to meet its obligations as they fall due. The Group finance function produces regular forecasts that estimate the cash inflows and outflows for the next 12 months, so that management can ensure that sufficient financing is in place as it is required. The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of banking arrangements in place.

The table below analyses the Group's financial liabilities on a contractual gross basis based on amount outstanding at the balance sheet date up to maturity date:

The Group would normally expect that sufficient cash is generated in the operating cycle to meet the contractual cash flows as disclosed above through effective cash management.

Interest rate risk

The Group's interest rate variation arises mainly from interest received on cash deposits. Any contractual agreements entered into at floating rates expose the entity to cash flow risk, while fixedrate deposits expose the entity to fair value risk. The Group uses a combination of fixed and floating deposits for its cash balances.

The Group has considered the potential impact of falling interest rates on its cash deposits and do not consider this to have a materially significant impact on the accounts and hence no sensitivity analysis is considered necessary.

The Group regularly reviews its funding arrangements to ensure they are competitive with the marketplace.

The table below shows the Group's and Company's financial assets and liabilities that could be affected by the fluctuation in interest rates split by those bearing fixed and floating rates and those that are non-interest bearing:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 October 2011
Credit Risk Exposure
Credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks. Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. External credit checks are obtained for larger customers. In addition, the credit quality of each customer is assessed internally before accepting any terms of trade. Internal procedures take into account customers' financial position, their reputation in the industry and past trading experience. As a result the group's exposure to bad debts is not significant due to the nature of its trade and relationships with customers.
Indeed, the Group having considered the potential impact of its exposure to credit risk, having due regard to both the nature of its business and customers, do not consider this to have a materially significant impact to the results.

The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in Trade and Other Receivables. The average credit period taken by theme parks on paying over the queuing system revenue is 14 days. The allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts has been made based upon the knowledge of the financial circumstances of individual trade receivables at the balance sheet date. The Group holds no collateral against these receivables at the balance sheet date.
The following table provides an analysis of trade and other receivables that were past due at 31 October 2011 and 31 October 2010 but against which no provision has been made. The Group believes that the balances are ultimately recoverable based on a review of past payment history and the current financial status of the customers.

Capital Risk Management

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

Foreign Currency Exposure

The Group has overseas operations in the USA, Canada, Italy, Germany, Spain and Australia and as such is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. The main operating currencies of its operations are in Sterling, US Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Euros. The Group's currency exposure comprises the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or 'functional' currency of the operating unit involved. At the period end Lo-Q plc, which reports in Sterling had bank balances of £1,540,212 (2010 - £1,056,894) denominated in US Dollars, £119,721 (2010 - £32,918) denominated in Canadian Dollars and £93,954 (2009 - £333,277) in Euros.

The Group manages risk by its subsidiaries matching revenue and expenditure in their local currency wherever possible. The Group tries to keep foreign inter company balances as low as possible to avoid translation adjustments.

Given the nature of the Groups' operations and their management of foreign currency exposure they limit the potential down side risk as far as practicably possible.

To show the impact of the fluctuation of the USD exchange rate on the Group financial statements, the table below shows how the period ended 31 October 2011 results would have been impacted by exchange rates of +/-$0.10.

The Group's policy is to utilise forward contracts where appropriate. The Group substantially managed its exposure in 2011 be entering in GBP/US$ forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuation. At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the group was committed was US$3m (2010: Nil), all of which mature during 2012. The fair value of a forward contract is considered equal to the value paid.

3. BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS
Segmental analysis
The Group's operating segments under IFRS have been determined with reference to the information presented in the management accounts reviewed by the Board of Directors.
The principle revenue generating activity of the Group is the operation of virtual queuing technologies for a theme park or other attraction. The Group has entered into agreements with theme park operators to allow theme park or attraction guests to make ride and show reservations when they visit a theme park or other attraction.
The Board considers that given the scale and nature of its present operations, it currently has a single operating and therefore reportable segment:
Rentals to guests, where the theme park or attraction operates the Group's products and the related sale of the system to third party lessors of the equipment and infrastructure installed in that park or attraction.
The Groups revenues, costs, assets, liabilities, currency exposure and cash flows are therefore totally attributable to this segment.
The definition and reporting of segments will be assessed as the Group develops the relative scale or number of operating segments.

Revenue generated in each of the geographical locations is generally in the local currency of the theme park or attraction based in that location.
Major Customers
The Group has entered into agreements with theme parks, theme park groups and attractions to operate the product in single or multiple theme parks or attractions within the theme park group.
The ultimate revenue of the business is derived from theme park or attraction guest rentals and no single guest forms a significant proportion of the revenue of the Group.
However, the ability to generate guest rentals is fully dependant on the Group maintaining and developing agreements with theme parks or attraction owners to operate its products. The Group does have an agreement with a single theme park group where sales to guests of that theme park group account for a significant and material amount of total revenue of the Group.

Employee benefit trust share subscription and Tom Burnett equity incentive plan
On 10 March 2011, the remuneration committee of the board recommended, and the board approved, an incentive arrangement pursuant to which the Company lent its employee benefit trust (`'EBT'') £1,331,956, and the EBT subscribed for 853,818 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the Company (`'New Ordinary Shares'').
The EBT plan subsequently granted Tom Burnet an interest in the growth in value above a share price of £2 per share in the New Ordinary Shares. In addition the EBT granted Tom Burnet an option to acquire, in relation to half of the New Ordinary Shares (426,909), the EBT's interest in the value between £1.30 and £2, provided that at the date of exercise the share price is above £1.82.
The shares are registered in the name of Lo-Q (Trustees) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. J Lillywhite and L Sim are directors of Lo-Q (Trustees) Limited.
