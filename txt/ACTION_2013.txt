MANAGEMENT REPORT OF ACTION S.A. (Company) ON OPERATIONS IN 2013
1. Basic figures and development prospects for the next business year
In the business year 2013 the Company ACTION S.A. reported sales revenues of PLN 4,626,825,000, an operating profit of PLN 83,389,000 and a net profit of PLN 62,768,000. When comparing the current results with those realised by the Company in the previous year, each of the above mentioned items showed a double-digit increase. Compared to the previous year, revenues from sales increased by 32.4%, operating profit by 23.8% and net profit by 30.6%. The above figures indicate a continuation of the growing sales trend in 2013, occurring during the noticeable decline in the national economic activity plus still unstable economic and budget situation in most Eurozone countries. Preliminary estimates for development prospects for 2014 suggest that sales will continue to grow and net return ratios will remain stable.

ACTION S.A.

2.1.1. Stock maintenance risk The Company's core business consists in selling technologically advanced products which are naturally exposed to the risk of becoming outdated, causing a decrease in their values. By launching new models, producers reduce the prices of products already available on the market. Due to the price protection clauses in agreements with suppliers and the standing market practice in this scope, the Company receives compensation for losses related to the decrease of stock value from all key suppliers. Regardless of benefits obtained from price protection mechanisms, the Company strives to ensure high rotation of maintained stocks.
2.1.2. Risk of receivables loss Trade receivables are the most significant item in terms of value in the Company's assets. As any entity involved in trading, the Company is exposed to the risk of losing some of its receivables. This risk increases as the economic slowdown advances on the domestic and global markets. Having regard to the potential loss of receivables, the Company takes out insurance against this risk with leading insuring companies.
2.2. Risk factors related to the environment in which the Company operates
2.2.1. Risk related to the macroeconomic situation in Poland The macroeconomic ratios of the Polish economy and its growth rate have a material impact on the value and trends observed on the IT equipment distribution market. Dealers' willingness to buy new IT equipment and consequently the value of purchases carried out by the Company's customers is to a large extent related to the GDP growth, the level of investments and the way in which retail customers perceive the market situation. Nonetheless, the current and projected rate of economic growth may negatively affect the demand for the IT equipment offered by the Company.
2.2.2. Foreign exchange risk The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. ACTION S.A. obtains over 70% of its sales revenues in Polish zloty while about 50% of goods are imported. Payments for imported goods are made mainly in USD and in EUR. This currency structure of cash flows results in foreign exchange risk. The risk is proportionally higher for changes observed on the foreign exchange market. The Company strives to minimise the foreign exchanges risk and in 2011 it adopted the Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. The principles of f/x risk management set forth in the policy indicated optimum hedging levels with relation to existing currency items and the related monitoring and control system based on three units. In accordance with the adopted accounting principles, the Company has undertaken to maintain hedges at a level close to 100% of the open foreign exchange position.
2.2.3. Legal environment risk Changing legal provisions or various interpretations thereof pose a threat to the operations of ACTION S.A. Certain amendments to the provisions of the law may have a negative impact on the Company's operations. Such amendments may affect the legal environment of the Company's operations to a considerable degree. The coming into force of a new regulation of material importance for trading may involve interpretation ambiguities, inconsistent decisions of the courts or unfavourable interpretations adopted by public administration authorities, etc.
2.2.4. Tax Policy Risk The Polish tax system is characterised by frequent changes in the tax regulations. Many of these are not structured precisely enough and there are no clear interpretations. Interpretations of tax provisions are subject to frequent change and, unfortunately, tax-related decisions made by both fiscal authorities and courts are inconsistent. As a result of divergent interpretations of tax regulations, a Polish company incurs greater risk than a company operating under more stable tax systems. In such circumstances the Company's operation and its tax recognition in income statements and tax returns may be deemed at variance with tax regulations by the fiscal authorities. However, it is anticipated that the two-instance proceedings implemented at administrative courts and the acquis communautaire will contribute significantly to the uniformity of court decisions in tax cases and, as a result, to the uniform application of the tax law, including by fiscal authorities. One of the elements of the risk related to legal regulations concerns the limitation period established for tax liabilities, which involves the possibility of verifying
___________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 2

(all amounts given in thousand zloty (PLN '000) unless indicated otherwise)

ACTION S.A.

whether the tax liabilities for the relevant period were calculated in a correct manner. Income statements specifying the amount of the tax liability and the amount of payments made may be verified by way of control by the fiscal authorities at any time during the five years from the end of the year during which the tax payment date passed. In the event that the fiscal authorities interpret the tax regulations on the basis of which the tax liability is calculated differently than that by the Company, it may have a material negative impact on the Company's operations, its financial standing and consequently on its results and growth prospects.
3. Corporate governance policies
ACTION S.A. is subject to the corporate governance principles: "Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies" adopted by Resolution No. 12/1170/2007 of the Warsaw Stock Exchange of 4 April 2007, the text hereof is included in the annex to the above mentioned resolution.

A statement concerning the application of corporate governance principles by ACTION S.A. in 2013, constituting an appendix to this Report, shall be published as a separate component of the Annual Report.

4. Identification of material proceedings pending before a court, competent arbitration authority or public administration authority
As at the day of submitting this Report, no proceedings were ongoing at any courts, authorities competent for arbitration proceedings or public administration authorities in relation to the Company's liabilities or receivables whose value, determined separately for individual proceedings and in total for all the proceedings, would represent at least 10% of the Company's equity.

The liquidity ratios presented by the Company are typical for the best distribution-oriented companies operating in the trade sector. The parameters of liquidity ratios in 2013 still confirm the stable liquidity position. It should be noted that fast liquidity ratios increased significantly.

As a result, it can be seen that despite a very dynamic increase in revenues from sales of 32.4%, the increase in the value of current assets was considerably lower and totalled 23.6%. Current liabilities grew at the same rate as current assets and the share of non-interest liabilities in financing current assets increased to 77%. The share of bank loans was further reduced by over 39% compared to the end of 2012, which accounted only for 7% of the sources of financing current assets and, after adjustment of their value, by the value of cash held - 3.6%. The figures presented above confirm that the Company enjoys a very stable financial situation and has significant development opportunities. The above data confirm effectiveness of measures taken by the Management Board to improve the financial position of the Company.
