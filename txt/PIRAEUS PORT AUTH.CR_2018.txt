D. Past performance, comments on Financial Statements and tangible / intangible assets
D1.Past performance According to the latest announcement of Hellenic Republic, GDP growth was maintained at 2.1% in
2018. This increase was due to the exports' increase (+ 8.3%) with higher imports rate (+3.1%)1.According to estimates by the National Bank of Greece 2, the above GDP estimates for 2018 as well as the financial expansion measures will allow GDP to increase in 2019 by a slightly higher rate than in 2018. In addition, consumption in 2019 is estimated to increase by 1.6% versus 0.9% in 2018 as a result of the increase in employment as well as in hourly wage. Therefore, prospects for the Greek economy are positive for 2019 as the international economic activity remains positive and the effects of the global economic cycle, the reduction of policies supportive to advanced economies and the impact of tariffs between the US and China do not adversely affect 3.

Revenues The total revenues for the year amounted to  132.9 million increased by 19.2% or  21.4 million (2017:  111.5 million).

The consumption of material showed an increase of 17.6% and amounted to  2.0 million in the 2018 compared to  1.7million in 2016.
Depreciation expenses showed an increase, amounted to  14.2 million ( 2017:  13.5 million) due to the investments in property, plant and equipment performed during the year.
Finally, a decrease was noted in the provision for trade/other receivables and legal cases, where an additional provision of  1.8 million for the current year was made, in contrast to the amount of  2.4 million that was made in 2017.
iii. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the year amounted to  0.8 million, compared to the year 2017 ( 2.2 million), showing a significant decrease of  1.4 million. The decrease is mainly due to decrease of research and development expenses by  0.6 million as well as of third parties compensation by approximately  0.4 million.
Statement of financial position i. Total Assets Total assets at December 31, 2018 amounted to  395.1 million, increased by 8.6% or  31.2 million (2017:  363.9 million). The increase in total assets is mainly due to the following: the increase of the net book value of property, plant and equipment by the amount of  22.3 million (due to the significant additions amounted to  37.3 million deducted by current year depreciation) as well as the increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash by  19.1 million. This increase was partly offset, mainly by the decrease of  9.6 million in trade and other receivables which mainly due to the decrease of advances to suppliers by  7.0 million (last year included advances to suppliers of  7.2 million due to a payment in advance to a related party for the purchase of a floating dock) (Note 10).
ii. Total Liabilities Total liabilities at December 31, 2018 amounted to  186.2 million showed an increase by  8.2 million (2017:  178.0 million). The change in total liabilities is mainly due to the changes in the following sub-headings, namely: the increase in accrued and other short-term liabilities of  7.5 million compared to December 31, 2017 which is mainly due to the increase in customer's payments in advance by  1.1 million, an increase of  0.7 million in concession agreement payment as well as the significant increase in taxes payable (other than income tax) by  4.3 million (Note 20). In addition an increase of  5.1 million in income tax payable, was reported in relation to the year 2017.These increases were mainly offset by the decrease of long term borrowings by  6.0 million due to the repayment of four installments, the decrease of the deferred income (concession agreement) by  1.3 million, as well as the reduction of the government grants by  1.4 million.

2. Principal risks
A. Monitoring the supply chain with reference to the main suppliers and their cooperation rules
Supply Chain There are no suppliers, the interruption of which would jeopardize the operation of the Company in
the event of a temporary failure of supplies provision.
B. Future prospects and how these are affected by the existing regulatory framework. ARTICLE 105 OF THE NEWLY ENACTED LAW 4504/2017 (Government Gazette Issue A 184/29 Nov.
2017) OF THE MINISTRY OF SHIPPING, AMENDING IN PRACTICE THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT ("HRCA") BETWEEN PPA S.A. AND THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC
Whereas according to the HRCA the Company has the right to either provide ships' waste management services itself or grant the right to one provider through open tender, application of Article 105 ("Provision of port reception, waste management and cargo residues services") of the above Law requires that the Company signs a contract with more than one entities expressing interest to provide the service, provided such entities are registered in the Ministry of Environment. This may lead to reductions in revenue from the above services and increase the environmental risk for the Company, due to lack of knowledge of (i) the financial agreements between ships and service providers, and (ii) the technical adequacy of such service providers.
C. Other risks that are related to the activity or sector that the company is operating.
- Risk of loss of assets The Company takes all necessary measures to minimize the risk and possible losses of assets due to natural disasters or similar related causes.
-Property insurance PPA S.A. has insured all its assets in accordance with the provisions of Article 17.1 of the CA with the Greek State for the following cases of damages: Fire, lightning, explosion, storm damage, aircraft crashes and named perils or Property All Risks, based on new replacement cost of asset. The income loss has been insured due to disaster-related closing of the business facility or due to the rebuilding process after a disaster, i.e. storm, earthquake, flood and strikes riots & terrorist actions.
-Maximum Probable Loss (MPL) analysis According to the requirements of the provisions of Art. 17 and Annex 17.1 of the CA, the company, is in the process of preparing the Maximum Probable Loss (MPL) analysis. The relevant tender procedure has been completed and the respective contract has signed with a specialized consulting firm in the field of risk insurance. The MPL analysis includes as a minimum the following elements: 1. Estimation of Maximum Probable Property Loss and loss of income for normal risks, excluding
natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.). 2. Estimation of Maximum Probable Property Damage and Loss of Revenues in Disastrous Risks, and in
particular in the event of an earthquake.

3. Risk Accountability Quotient that will analyze and quantify the probable scenarios of liability losses, including environmental liability, under the worst case scenarios for the worst case scenario.
- Business Risks Associated with the Company's business activities A detailed report on the main risks associated with the sector in which the Company operates is set out in Chapter D of the Non-Financial Report, which follows (Risk Policy and Risk Management / Major Business Risks and Uncertainties).
- Financial Instruments
Fair Value: The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying sheets of financial position for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, prepayments, trade and other accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
The fair value of variable rate loans and borrowings approximate the amounts appearing in the statements of financial position.
The Company categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value in three categories, defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) values from active financial markets for identical negotiable assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value are identified or determined directly or indirectly from active financial markets.
Level 3: Techniques that use inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value and are not based on quoted prices from active financial markets.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
As at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

The Company recognizes both its obligations to the environment and the need to continuously improve its environmental performance so as to achieve a balanced economic development in harmony with environmental protection.
A. Actual and potential impacts on the environment
The actual and potential impacts on the environment from the operation and activities of PPA S.A. are assessed in the approved Environmental Impact Assessment of PPA S.A. The company has in force a Decision of Environmental Terms, approved by the Competent Hellenic Ministry, and it promotes the correct and full implementation of these Environmental Terms to ensure the prevention and reduction of the impact on all the environmental parameters.
B. Procedures implemented for the prevention and control of pollution and environmental impacts
PPA S.A. is a member of the European EcoPorts network and in this framework a Self-Diagnosis Method report (SDM) has been elaboratied and is being updated every two years.
Furthermore PPA S.A. implements an integrated environmental management certified according to the European Environmental System focused in port sector: PERS (Port Environmental Review System).
In the scope of the environmental management system PERS and EcoPorts network membership, PPA S.A. has elaborated and implemented specific environmental policy, procedures of implementation and updates in permanent base record of environmental parameters associated with all the activities, while it aims at continuous improvement of its environmental performance, following the European and international standards and aiming to protect the environment and conserve natural resources for future generations.

As part of implementation of PERS environmental management system and in accordance with the Environmental Terms of port's operation, PPA S.A. has developed and implements the following procedures for the prevention and control of pollution and environmental impacts:
Air quality monitoring program. Since 2009, PPA S.A. has been implementing, in cooperation with the National Technical University of Athens, an integrated program for the monitoring of air pollution through a specialised monitoring station in order to identify, assess and quantify the significant gas emissions of the port and to develop appropriate actions and operational techniques for protecting and improving air quality in the port area. The parameters recorded and monitored are: NOx nitrogen oxide, SO2 sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide CO, heavy metals, PAHs, PM10 particles, BTEX hydrocarbons. At the same time, the program was enhanced with air emissions simulation and dispersion models which will be evaluated with the on-site measurements for the integration of the assessment of air quality in the port area.
Sea water quality monitoring program. PPA S.A. implements a Maritime Water Quality Monitoring Program across the port area and identifies appropriate corrective measures. In the present period, new co-operation with the Civil Engineering Dept. of Athens National Technical University (Laboratory of Sanitary Technology of the Department of Water Resources and Environment) is under way, in which the Program is updated as regards the measurement parameters, sampling positions, method and frequency of sampling as well as the measurement method. Sampling frequency is twice a year.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Environmental quality monitoring program on acoustic environment. PPA S.A. implements, in collaboration with an external consultant, an integrated monitoring programme of noise, covering the entire port area and focusing on the reduction of noise levels from sources related to container terminal operations, construction works, vehicles movements. The Leq indicator is measured and monitored throughout the port area of PPA S.A., twice a year.
Integrated waste management system produced on land installations is implemented since 2009, to enhance recycling and reduce the quantities that lead to final disposal at landfills and procurement of environmentally friendly materials, where appropriate. The main waste streams that are recycled are paper, glass, packaging, empty ink cartridges & toners, used batteries and accumulators, waste electrical and electronic equipment, waste lubricating oils, tires, waste timber, operating waste workshop, operating waste tanks (floating and fixed), scrap and metal, waste from excavation, construction and demolition.
Ship-generated Waste Management Plan, approved by the competent Hellenic Ministry, is implemented since 2008 in accordance with the European Directive 2000/59 on port ship generated waste and cargo residues, as incorporated into Greek law, and the provisions of the International Convention on Marine Pollution and MARPOL 73/78. According to the Plan a system for Port Reception Facilities is established for the collection and management of solid and liquid Ship-generated waste by specialized contractors. Till today no complaints have been made.
Emergency & Terrestrial Marine Pollution Contingency Plan, approved by the competent Hellenic Ministry, for dealing with oil pollution incidents and other harmful substances in the port area of PPA.
PPA S.A. is certified according to ISO 14001: 2015 for Environmental Management by Lloyd's Register (LR).
C. Reference to the development of green products and services
PPA S.A. acknowledged the need to reduce resource consumption and, in particular, save energy across the port activities. PPA S.A. highlights the issue by promoting initiatives and behaviors to improve the balance of demand and supply of energy and to reduce energy consumption.
In this context, PPA S.A. has installed and operates since August 2016 a photovoltaic power plant using solar panels, producing up to 430 kWp. The photovoltaic plant is connected to the electricity grid of DEDDIE SA (Administrator of the Greek Electricity Distribution Network).
4. Labor issues
Promoting equal opportunities and protecting diversity are key principles of the Company. Management does not discriminate in recruitment / selection, pay, education, job assignment or any other work activities.

In addition, there were 15 employees under labor contract of private law for a fixed period and 3 under project contract basis.
The gender difference in the Company's staffing is mainly attributable to the labor intensive characteristics of the main work items of PPA S.A., which showed an interest in recruitment almost exclusively by men, despite the fact that in the relevant declarations for the recruitment of personnel of these specialties (dock workers, lifting equipment operators, heavy-duty drivers) there were no gender exclusion criteria.
Of the 137 employees assigned in responsibility positions on various tiers of the company's hierarchy (manager, deputy manager, assistant manager, head of sector, superintendent supervisor), 100 (73%) were men with and 37 (27%) women.
The women participation among manager, deputy manager, and assistant manager positions reached the 43.5%.
B. Respect for employees' and trade union rights
Respect for employees rights The Company respects the rights of employees and observes the Labor Legislation. In the year 2018,
no control body accused for violations of labor law. There were cases of three (3) appeals to the Labor Inspectorate raised by two (2) employees which concerned issues of employment discernment (keeping working rows) that have been dealt with by the implementation of the rostering system since September 2018.
Trade union rights The Company, as employer, is liable to (articles 11 e, f, g of GSR): - Ensure that the trade unions of its employees are regularly informed of all staff-related matters and of the Company's business activities in general, where those have an impact on employment relations; - Not intervene in any manner in the legitimate trade union activities of employees; - Promote interactive discussion with the representatives of employees, especially with any firstdegree and second-degree trade unions representing its employees in the context of collective autonomy and informed dialogue.

7. Non-Financial Report
A) Description of the PPA S.A. Business Model.
In addition to the Report of the Board of Directors entitled "Analysis of the development & performance of the company's activities and position" and the brief description of the business model that has taken place, the following are stated:
The Piraeus Port Authority S.A. (PPA) PPA is the legal entity entrusted with the administration and operation of the Port of Piraeus. It was
established as a legal entity of public law by virtue of Law 4748/1930, which was restated by Compulsory Law 1559/1950 and ratified by Law 1630/1951, each as subsequently amended and supplemented. In 1999 PPA was transformed into a stock corporation (société anonyme).
Pursuant to the enabling provisions contained in the thirty-fifth article of Law 2932/2001 (Government Gazette A' 145/27.7.2001), the Hellenic Republic and PPA entered into a concession agreement on 13 February 2002 (2002 HRCA). In the 2002 HRCA, the Hellenic Republic granted PPA the exclusive right of use and exploitation of the land, buildings and infrastructure comprising the Port of Piraeus, for an initial term of forty years, and subject to further terms and conditions. Certain amendments to the 2002 Agreement, including the extension of the concession's term by ten years, were authorised on behalf of the Hellenic Republic by virtue of a joint ministerial decision on 19 November 2008 (Government Gazette B' 2372/21.11.2008). These amendments were agreed upon in an addendum to the 2002 Agreement executed between the Hellenic Republic and PPA on 18 November 2008 (the 2008 HRCA). The 2002 Agreement, as amended by the 2008 Addendum (together the Old Concession Agreement), was subsequently ratified by virtue of the first and third article of Law 3654/2008 (Government Gazette A' 57/03.04.2008).

Page 27  120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
In April 2016, following an open international public tender process, the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF), under its capacity as the major shareholder of PPA, and COSCO HK Ltd entered into a Shares Purchase Agreement (hereinafter: SPA) for the acquisition of the majority participation of 51% in the share capital of PPA. In August 2016, after the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, the SPA was affected by the execution of the transaction and the transfer of PPA's majority shares from HRADF to COSCO HK Ltd and PPA S.A. ceased to be a state-owned company and since that day it is a private-owned company.
In the framework of the Privatisation Process and as envisaged and permitted by the Old Concession Agreement (including, without limitation, article 15.1(iii) thereof), the Hellenic Republic and PPA engaged in negotiations, resulting in the finalisation and conclusion of a new amendment of the Old Concession Agreement, which was finally signed by the parties on 29/06/2016 and ratified by law 4404/2016 (Government Gazette A' 126/08.07.2016).
The objective of the Company is to perform its obligations, conduct its activities and exercise its faculties under or in respect of the concession agreement between the Company and the Hellenic Republic dated 13 February 2002 regarding the use and exploitation of certain areas and assets within the Port of Piraeus, as amended and in force (the "Concession Agreement"), in accordance with the law.
For the purpose of attaining its object under paragraph 1 above, the Company may, by way of an illustrative but no means exhaustive list, conduct and engage in the following activities: (a) use all rights assigned to the Company pursuant to the CA and maintain, utilize and exploit all concession assets in accordance with the Concession Agreement; (b) provide services and facilities to vessels, cargo and passengers, including ship berthing and cargo and passenger handling to and from the port; (c) install, organize and exploit all kinds of port infrastructure; (d) undertake any activities related to the port and all other commercial activities associated with or reasonably incidental to the operation of the port of Piraeus; (e) engage third parties to provide any kind of port services; (f) award contracts for works; (g) engage in such further activities as are prudent or customary for the proper conduct of its business and operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement; and (h) engage in any and all activities, transactions or operations of a type that are conducted by commercial corporations generally.
Evolution of Business Activities
Cruise Activity The reduced supply of itineraries and capacity in eastern Mediterranean, result of the negative
geopolitical circumstances in countries on the Asian coast, affected negatively the volume of passengers. Despite the negative circumstances, Piraeus managed to attract greater homeport volume improving the qualitative characteristics of throughput in the port and the financial results. In particular, the total volume of passengers in 2018 was 961,632 compared to 1,055,559 in 2017 recording a reduction of 8.9%. The homeport passengers were 354,398 compared to 332,611 in 2017 recording increase of 6.6%. Reduction of 9% was recorded in cruise ship calls with 524 calls in 2018 compared to 576 in the previous year.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Coastal traffic Total coastal passenger traffic, in 2018, at domestic routes recorded marginal increase of 0.7% to
15,657,368 passengers compared to 15,555,123 in 2017. This increase came mainly from the improved traffic volumes for the Aegean and the Saronic islands (4.2% and 7.4% respectively), while the sector of Salamis ferry recorded a decrease of 4.7%. The throughput of the "subsidized routes" recorded a rapid increase but the total throughput that amounted to 27,458 passengers does not affect materially the transportation volumes.
A similar picture is recorded in the traffic of vehicles in coastal shipping, with marginal decrease in traffic by 0.1% (2.646.189 in 2018 compared to 2.648.725 in 2017). Increase is recorded in the traffic of domestic routes (3.8%) and Saronic islands (6.9%) and reduction in Salamis ferry (2.7%).
Car Terminals After 3 years of increase of transportation with double-digit growth, in 2018 the throughput in the
car terminals remained almost stable. Total traffic in 2018 amounted to 429,170 vehicles compared to 431,157 in 2017 recording marginal decrease of 0.5%. It is important to be noted that the cargo for the domestic market recorded again double-digit rate of growth by 17.5% (from 99,325 in 2017 to 116,737) while the transshipment cargo reduced by 5.8% (312,433 units in 2018 compared to 331,832). However, the number of import vehicles continues to be significantly below the traffic of 2009, before the financial crisis, that amounted to over 173,000 vehicles, which creates further positive prospects. In the sector of transshipment, the traffic amounted to 312,433 compared to 331,832 units in 2017 affected by the decrease of sales in Turkey due to the fall of the Turkish lira. Moreover, some neighbouring ports, with the exception of Piraeus, encounter congestion that affects the whole supply chain in eastern Mediterranean and directs flows to ports of west and north Europe.
Container Terminal Pier I in 2018 handled 498,708 TEU compared to 453,264 TEU in 2017, achieving an increase of
10%. Significant increase 25.4% recorded the volume of local cargo from 76,188 TEU in 2017 to 95,673 TEU in 2018. The increase of transshipment cargo was 6.9% reaching 403,035 TEU in 2018. The significant increase of local cargo throughput was assisted from the improvement of the domestic economic sentiment and the adoption of more flexible structures of operation that allow more direct response to the needs of the customers.
Ship Repair Activity The ship repair sector recorded significant increases in 2018 as a result of the investments, the
improvement of invoices and aggressive marketing. In the dry-docks sector 104 ships were served in 2018 compared to 88 in 2017 (+18%) while the days of occupancy recorded big increase (54%) strengthened also from the activation of floating dock "Piraeus III" with lifting capacity of 22,000 tones. The repaired ships reached 275 in 2018 compared to 272 in the previous year recording marginal increase.
International Conditions ­ Prospects The PPA acts as an international trade gate for the Country as well as a transshipment centre for
goods primarily for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea regions. The Company's activities depend on the Country's economic conditions, the course of international trade and the geopolitical conditions of the immediate geographical environment.
Page 29  120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Significant prospects are created from the adoption of the geopolitical initiative of China for effective transportation between ports of various countries and of China in the framework of Belt and Road Initiative. In this program is also included a maritime component, and Piraeus can benefit from the role of port entry into the EU and from increased connections with other ports.
Cruise Activity The approval for financing by 95%, of the Cruise Expansion of the port of Piraeus of funded budget of
120m by the Managing Authority, is the most important event of the year. The construction of the new infrastructure that will increase by two the berths for cruise ships over 300m, sets the conditions for the attraction of new itineraries in the wider area and the further growth of the market. The work is expected to be completed in 2022 and in combination with the new passenger terminal on the new infrastructure creates new prospects for cruise both at Piraeus and the Greek economy in general.
Worldwide, based on CLIA data, the cruise market in 2018 is expected to reach 28.2 million passengers versus 26.7 million in 2017. The geopolitical environment in eastern Mediterranean from 2016 with the political turmoil in Turkey, the war situation in Syria and the negative publicity from the refugee flows, lead to the withdrawal of capacity and itineraries from the area. Given that the industry of cruise has a cycle of scheduling itineraries of approximately 2 years the prospects for 2017 and 2018 were restrained. The data for the last two years confirmed that cruise adopts a risk adverse policy.
The negative prospects of the previous two years are gradually being reversed and if the geopolitical environment maintains at least the present situation it is expected the gradual return of itineraries and capacity. Already, in the Greek market, in 2018 with the undertaking of coordinated actions both in the tourism sector and the involved ports of cruise, the traffic in the ports of the country achieved to record increase of the order of 3.5% .Already, the pre-reservation of berths for cruise ships for 2019 in Piraeus are recording increase 15% compared to 2018 and is estimated that will be around the number of calls of 2016 when it was achieved the peak of 5 years in cruise passenger traffic.
Coastal Traffic Coastal shipping is mainly influenced by the economic situation in the Country that affects the
movement of passengers and cargo to and from the islands and to a lesser extent by the volume of tourists. Passenger traffic to and from the islands is also affected by the intensity of competition between low-cost airlines and ships.
For the period 2018-2021, an average economic growth rate of 2.4% is forecasted that will help maintain passenger and cargo flows for the islands. The transportation of passengers of coastal shipping, in the total of the Country, in the first six months of 2018 records increase of approximately 7.4%. The arrivals of tourists in the 10 months of 2018 are estimated to 28.7million recording an increase 10.8% in comparison to the respective period of the previous year. Nevertheless, this increase of traffic at the port of Piraeus was more conservative as significant number of coastal traffic concerns movements between islands which do not pass through Piraeus.
The upward course of the cost of bunkers after the low of November 2016 is estimated that will bring increase to fares and most likely will affect primarily the domestic non-tourist transportation which is important for the non-peak months. Based on the above in the short-term, the change of transportation of passengers is forecasted to be marginal in 2019.
Page 30  120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Car Terminals Based on the most recent information in 2018 the seaborne transport of vehicles, after the recovery
in 2017 is estimated that will record new rise of the order of 5% as a result of the increased sales to all the main markets (EU, USA, China). For the European exports the messages are mixed as the rise of the exports to China (+7.1%), Japan (+5.6%) and South Korea (+37.8%) is accompanied by the reduction of exports in the USA (-8.7%). The restrained investment policy in new ships from the carriers contributed critically in the recovery of the industry and the freights.
Piraeus in contrast to critical competitive ports of eastern Mediterranean does not record problems of port congestion. It is affected however the whole network of transshipment that increases the weekly peaks. Moreover, in several cases the congestion is a result of the progress of investment plans in competitive ports that in the medium term will increase the port supply and will increase the price competition which creates risks.
Moreover, the worldwide economic environment is volatile due to the trade war in the trade of USAChina and the probability of its expansion to EU with emphasis on the export of vehicles. The vagueness in the way of withdrawal of UK from the EU creates additional dangers as it cannot be determined the consequences in the volumes of transshipment and the effects on port function from probable change in the dues. More specifically 54% of the 1.7 million vehicles that are being manufactured in the UK are exported to the EU and the 82% of the sales of vehicles in the Country comes from the EU providing important transportation work at intra-European level and volumes of transshipment.
In the mid-term, PPA is planning important investments in order to increase the capacity to the storage areas and to capitalize permanently the positive circumstances in eastern Mediterranean. It is planning the construction of 2 five-storey parking buildings for the increase of its capacity with special area for heavy machinery, systems of electronic administration as well as the application of free zone. In this framework, it is estimated that the domestic cargo will continue the trend in 2019 albeit at a reduced rate, while the cargo of transshipment will improve marginally.
Container Terminal According to the most recent data, seaborne container trade in TEU increased by 4% in 2018 but last
6 months recorded reduced rate of increase. The increase in transported volumes was mainly driven by the increase in the routes from Asia to Europe and by increased traffic within Asia. The Asia-Europe route directly related to Piraeus increased by 6% in the third quarter but on an annual basis the demand is limited to 1.7%. The investment policy of shipping companies continues to focus on big ships with economies of scale, with the overwhelming majority of the orders to concern ships over 11,000TEU. This policy of orders led to reduced freights in the route Asia-Europe. In this context, the tendency for slot sharing agreements in various peripheral and central routes is strengthened with result the limitation of potential customers for the ports. To what concerns with respect to the domestic cargo, this depends from the course of the national economy and the prospects from the increase of GDP remain positive as long as the political stability is maintained and new tax burdens are avoided.
The qualitative features of the terminal such as large natural drafts, 24-hour single tariff operation, tide-free access, good weather conditions and the competitive bunker market, are the competitive advantages of Piraeus. These competitive advantages have increased importance within the weak market conditions in liner trades and increasing trend of cooperative schemes adopted by the companies which create challenges to attracting new transshipment cargo.
 31  120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
In addition, the continuous increase in intra-Europe trade that increased by 13% in value in the last two years, and the increase in the Country's exports creates valid positive expectations for additional business at the port. Furthermore, the domestic cargo will increase in the context of economic development of the Country which records positive prospects.

Ship Repair Activity Traditionally, Piraeus has significant shipbuilding activity and know-how. The lack of infrastructure
renewal and the loss of competitiveness to neighboring countries did not allow the industry to maintain a leading role in the region. As a result, most of the ship repair activity took place in countries such as Turkey and Bulgaria, which appear to offer lower costs but do not offer better know-how from the companies located at the Piraeus Ship Repair Zone (SRZ). On several occasions, based on their knowhow and expertise, companies from Piraeus SRZ undertook ship repairs in other countries.
The purchase and activation of the new dry-dock purchased by the PPA put into operation in the first quarter of 2018, combined with the upgrading of other infrastructure at the SRZ will positively affect the attraction of ship repair works. At the same time, the creation of cooperative structures between the PPA and the companies at the SRZ to jointly undertake ship repair works will contribute to improving competitiveness and will offer the opportunity for competitive offers at international level. In this context, the medium-term outlook for Piraeus SRZ is considered to be particularly positive considering the political instability in the directly competitive market of Turkey.

 Regulating Issues of Shipwrecks' Lifting / Raising, removal of dangerous and harmful vessels
According to Articles 2, 3 and 5 of Law 2881/2001 "Regulation of wreck raising issues and other provisions", they must be lifted and removed (by the owner of the shipwreck or ship) out of port, in a whole or in parts, or, if required from the circumstances, shifted or destroyed or in any way eliminated, in accordance with the applicable provisions, in order to eliminate any risk and prevent any adverse consequence from the existence of the shipwreck, which constitutes a risk to navigation in the area of port's responsibility, obstructs the mooring, the anchoring, the berthing, the use of docks and generally the port's operation, or harms or threatens to harm the environment:
- shipwrecks within the meaning of Article 2 of Law 2881/2001 because they are semi-sunk and may cause damage to the rest of the vessels docked in the particular sea area, they disturb the proper operation of the port. - dangerous and harmful ships in a port within the meaning of Article 3 of Law 2881/2001, because their overall situation implies a sinking possibility, - constitute harmful ships due to immobility in a port within the meaning of Article 5 of Law 2881/2001 that remain stationary and idle without maintenance and diligence in the port area.
In the context of the above Law, an Advisory Committee was established by PPA, on issues of lifting, removing or eliminating shipwrecks or ships. This committee, which is chaired by a PPA executive, is composed by representatives of the Piraeus Port Police Authority (A, B, C and D Port Departments), representative of the Attica Region, representative of the Piraeus Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representatives of the Local Authorities (Municipality of Piraeus, Municipality of Perama, Municipality of Keratsini-Drapetsona and Municipality of Salamina).
he Committee's work is to issue an opinion on the matters of lifting or elimination of shipwrecks or ships located in the port area of PPA S.A.
b.2. Policies and Due Diligence for safety issues
At high-risk areas (Container Terminal and Perama Ship Repair Zone) the organization provides two ambulances with trained rescue personnel (two rescuers per vehicle) that are available 24/7, to cover emergencies that may occur in the above mentioned areas.
b.3. Due Diligence Policies for Regulatory Issues
To comply with the requirements of the CA dated 24 June 2016 concluded between the Hellenic Republic and Piraeus Port Authority SA regarding the Use and Exploitation of Certain Areas and Assets within the Piraeus Port, by decision of the Company Management was established Monitoring Committee of the above concession.

c.3. Outcome of Due Diligence Policies for Regulatory Issues
The established Monitoring Committee of the CA of 24 June 2016 of the Hellenic Republic and PPA S.A. met twelve (12) times in the year 2018, controlling in any case the obligations arising for the Company under the above contract and submitted duly completed, within the predetermined date the Compliance Certificate (and its supplementary documents) of 2017, as defined in Article 14.1 (c) of the Concession Agreement.
D) Principal Risks and their Management
Risk Policy
Piraeus Port Authority S.A. aims to provide high quality, efficient and safe port services in a sustainable manner, contribute to local and national economy, strengthen the port's position and achieve sustainable growth. Various factors such as internal and external issues, interested parties' needs & expectations could be considered as possible risks that can or could negatively affect the company in achieving its objectives and strategy and therefore it is vital to be identified and addressed. The company determines, evaluates and addresses any possible risks in order to: - achieve its mission, vision, profit, objectives, policy, customer satisfaction, legal and other
obligations compliance, enhancement of environmental performance - enhance desirable effects - prevent or reduce undesired effects, including the potential for external environmental conditions
to affect the organization - achieve continual improvement

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
PPA's Top Management is committed to ensure the continuing effort to address all risks involved with its operation and undertake all necessary proactive actions.
Risk Management Procedure PPA S.A. is promoting awareness of risk-based thinking to all its departments in order to protect its values and address uncertainty. Therefore, each business unit is responsible to implement a risk assessment procedure. This procedure includes the following stages:
a) Identification of various organizational, managerial and operational existing and emerging risks that can or could negatively affect the conformity of services, customer satisfaction, quality policy and objectives, the strategic direction of the company.
b) Evaluation of the nature and level of risk. Significant environmental aspects are also included in the risk assessment and evaluated with a business perspective. Additionally, the impact of environmental aspects in particular to the environment is assessed through the Environmental Aspects Assessment.
c) Determination of the risk's likelihood of occurrence and its consequences. d) Preparation and implementation of actions to address risks. These actions shall be proportionate
to the potential impact on the conformity of services. Options to address risks may include avoiding risks, taking risk in order to pursue an opportunity, eliminating the risk source, changing the likelihood or consequences, sharing the risk, or retaining the risk by informed decision. e) Successful integration of actions to address risks into the company's processes according to the significance level of the risk. Identified risks with high and serious significance are being addressed in priority. f) Evaluation of actions' effectiveness through monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This process is monitored by the Quality Control and Inspection Dept through Internal Audits conducted at all company's depts.
The above procedure is under the coordination of the Quality Control and Inspection Dept which provides support to each department for the compiling as well as for the necessary review and update of the risk assessment. The review and update takes place at least once a year and always prior to the enforcement of any change, so that the company has early warning of upcoming changes that it needs to react to and plan for. Appropriate documented information as evidence of the results of monitoring and measurement activities regarding the actions taken are retained from each relevant Department and the Quality Control & Inspection Department. During the Management Review by the Top Management, the Quality Control & Inspection Dept presents all necessary information and data on the progress and the effectiveness of the actions taken to address risks. Relevant decisions are being taken by the Top Management. The above procedure is included in PPA's Procedures' Manual that has been approved by Top Management's decision.

Major Risks and Uncertainties in 2019.
Wider Economic Environment Maintaining the stable economic environment in the Country is directly related to import and export
volumes and, by extension, to the import-export volumes that offer the highest average revenue to the Company. The year 2019, will be a year of multiple elections in Greece which contributes to the postponement of consumption as well as governmental decisions. Regardless of the political environment in 2019, the company's strategy is based on strengthening and expanding transshipment volumes that are not directly dependent on domestic economic conditions to mitigate any negative impact from a possible negative change in the domestic economic climate.
Economic instability The geopolitical and economic instability in the countries of North Africa, the Asian Mediterranean and
the Black Sea can have a negative effect on the transshipment volumes in Piraeus. The drop of the Turkish lira made more competitive the exports from Turkey and improved the competitiveness of its ports. At the same time, the continued war in Syria and the further involvement of Turkey increases the instability in the region and affects the trade routes and the tourist demand. To mitigate risk, the Company has undertaken a program to develop a rail link with Central Europe and is in the process of seeking customers to expand its port hinterland to the north, thus reducing dependence on maritime markets to the south and south-east.
ew forms of energy The 2020 deadline for the use of low-sulfur fuel (0.5%) puts pressure on shipping companies to choose
the most appropriate solution through scrubbers or the use of natural gas. Already in the cruise sector, there are orders for 16 ships of seven cruise lines using natural gas. At the same time, container carriers also have ships with dual fuel capabilities. One of the competitive advantages of Piraeus is the extensive and financially competitive shipping fuel supply market. In this context, the Company, in cooperation with the gas sales and distribution companies of Greece, participates in a European funded project aiming at the study and implementation of competent solutions and infrastructure so that ships in the port can be supplied with natural gas. In this way, the Company aims to maintain its competitive advantage as well as to comply with the regulatory requirements of the European Directives.
In the container sector, the most significant risk comes from the high dependence on a single customer (95% of traffic volume). The possibility of a new round of industry consolidation on the carriers' side due to the protracted period of weak market conditions, in the medium term, will intensify intra-port and international competition and limits the options for attraction of new cargo. To mitigate risk, the Company has adopted a customer-centric approach while at the same time implements an aggressive policy to attract new customers by presenting the locational and service quality advantages of the port.
Non-expanded clientele (Container terminal) In the container sector, the most significant risk comes from the high dependence on a single
customer (95% of traffic volume). To mitigate risk, the Company has adopted a customer-centric approach while at the same time implements an aggressive policy to attract new customers. However, the intensifying intra-port and international competition provides limited options for attraction of new cargo in the short-term.

Geopolitical conditions In the sector of car terminals, the uncertainty of agreement for the exit of UK from the EU is estimated
that it can disturb the supply chain for vehicles as important volume of vehicles for the EU is manufactured in the UK. In the medium term, and according to the developments there will be alteration of the supply chain as it is probable the transfer of production capacity to the existing centers of central Europe, reinforcing in this way the competitiveness of other ports with proximity to the centers of production. Piraeus which is based mainly to transshipment from Asia due to distance from the centers of production of EU could lose competitiveness. At the same time however, the change of the supply chain provides also opportunities. The Company has intensified the discussions with European and Asian automobile companies in order to present the advantages of Piraeus. At the same time, it has planned significant increase in capacity and invests in mechanical and information technology equipment that will improve the quality of service both to the automobile companies and the shipping companies. In addition, it aims to extend the hinterland by train to the Balkan and Central European countries where automotive factories are located. In the cruise sector, the most significant risk comes from exogenous factors of geopolitical nature. The Company, to mitigate the impact, aggressively promotes Piraeus to the Chinese market in which it has privileged access due to its parent company, while at the same time informing the internal market about the best ways to attract tourist volume from China.
E) Financial and Non-Financial Performance Indicators.

A detailed presentation of a mixture of general and sectoral indicators took place in the module Business Model - Evolution of Business Activities with a distinct reference to traffic data of each Company's business (Cruise, Coasting, Car Transmission Station, Container Handling Station, Ship Repair).

Additionally, PPA S.A. has incorporated all non-financial information in its Corporate Responsibility Report 2018, which will be drafted and issued in line with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) international framework (Standards edition). The report will be posted on the company's website (www.olp.gr) in the "Social Responsibility" section.

F.1) Environmental Matters.

PPA SA recognizes that the resources consumption must be used in an efficient way across the port

sector. Port of Piraeus' nature and size favors a high amount of daily energy consumed (e.g. ship-to-shore

cranes, terminals lighting, reefer containers, administration buildings, workshops). PPA raises awareness

on the subject by promoting initiatives and behaviors to improve the balance of the demand and supply

of energy and to reduce energy consumption. In this scope, PPA's first photovoltaic station generating

energy using solar panels has been put into operation in July 2016, generating up to 430 kWp. The

photovoltaic Station is linked up to the Public Power Corporation electricity grid.

PPA SA has recognized the need to reduce resource consumption and particularly to save energy while

continuing to provide a safe and secure working environment. Electricity and oil usage has been identified

in various energy efficiency reviews as an area for potential reduction. Indicative energy saving measures

implemented by PPA SA are:



Staff environmental awareness



Purchasing of electrical equipment with > A energy class and certification



Improvement of buildings' energy efficiency

Waste produced from port facilities operation4

The total quantities of waste from all installations and activities of PPA SA for the years 2017 and 2018

are presented in the following table. The waste is distinguished in hazardous and non-hazardous waste,

recyclable packaging (blue bins) and in operational waste of PPA plants driven to recovery (lead to

collective alternative management systems, etc.)

In general minor fluctuations are observed between 2017 and 2018 data. Although operating wastes

show a significant increase in 2018. This increase is due to the production of Excavation, Construction and

Demolition Waste (AEKK) produced by special cleaning works in rainwater pipelines at the pier C2 of the

Car Terminal.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)



For the year 2018 there is a very large increase in the amount of Construction Demolition and

Excavation Waste () which resulted from special cleaning works on pipelines at the C2

Station of the Car Station. These quantities of AEKK are not waste generated systematically by the

installations and activities of PPA SA but were generated by a specific project that was

implemented in 2018.



In year 2017 PPA did not deliver used tires because insufficient quantities were gathered to

deliver and handle through the Alternative Tire Management System. In the year 2018 9.4 tonnes

of used tires were delivered and managed.



In 2018 Used Accumulators were not delivered to management, as insufficient quantities

were produced.

2. Marine and Terrestrial Pollution
Pollution incidents in the sea water (no of incidents) Pollution incidents on the
land (no of incidents)

2018 10 1

2017 18 1

The above data show that in 2018 marine pollution incidents were fairly limited compared to 2017. In any case, in both years, all incidents were small and local and were immediately dealt without any problems, by implementing the contingency plan of PPA SA.

3. Results of noise measurements The following table presents the locations and results of the noise measurements for the years 2017
and 2018. It is noted that the locations of the measurements are at the boundary of the ownership of PPA SA and are usually affected by road traffic noise outside the port. It is noticed that the noise levels remain stable without significant changes per position in the last four semesters. It is also noted that in the yard of the school 1st EPAL of Perama (position 05) PPA SA has placed sound panels. Measurements prove that the sound panels ensure the noise protection of the school [the noise is reduced by 10-15 dB (A)].

4. Results of atmospheric measurements

For the year 2018, only figures for the first semester of 2018 are available at the moment. Data from

the first half of 2018 show the following main conclusions.



Volatile organic compounds are in low concentrations. The average concentration of benzene

is less than the limit value of 5,0 g m-3. The average values of benzene, toluene,

ethylenebenzene, m + p-xylenes and o-xylene were respectively 2.7, 7.3, 1.5, 5.5 and 1.7 g

m-3.



The suspended particles show a variation in their concentrations.



NO2, SO2, CO did not exceed the average hourly and mean eight hour



In general, the results do not differ from those of the previous measurement period.

5. Complaint Management

One complaint was made about noise nuisance in 2017 and one complaint about noise nuisance in

2018, both focused on the adjacent Container Terminal area.

The complaints were submitted by residents of the area neighboring to the Container Terminal and

they were thoroughly investigated by PPA SA.

Regarding the complaints night measurements were carried out in similar operating conditions with

those that were described, which confirmed the results of the main monitoring program and in particular,

the following results were obtained:



The measurements' results are directly influenced by the traffic of the Dimokratias Avenue,

which is very close to the houses



During the night hours the operation of the port (loading, stowage, Straddle Carriers'

movement etc.) becomes audibly perceived to the houses in a lower degree compared to

the neighboring street's noise.

3. Internal auditors must report to the BoD in writing, at least once per trimester and semester, on the

conducted audit and attend the General Assemblies of Shareholders.

4. Internal auditors provide, following approval by the BoD, any information, which may be requested in

writing by the Supervisory Authorities, cooperate with the latter and facilitate in every possible way the

5. In addition to the above responsibilities, the Internal Audit Service conducts a sample audit of all

V. Diversity Policy applied in relation to the Company's administrative, managerial and supervisory bodies
1. According the Corporate Governance Code of the Company, the size and composition of the Board of Directors must allow for effective discharge of the duties thereof and reflect the size, activity and ownership of the business. The Board of Directors must be of the highest ethical standards of integrity and have a diversity of knowledge, qualifications and experience, to meet the corporate objectives. As such is reflected in the BoD's Members' CVs, the Board consists of very experienced Directors, who have diversified cultural and professional background, which is essential for the effective oversight of the Company's activities and for the smooth transition of the Company to a new era of growth. 2. The executives of the Company with managerial positions cover a wide range of educational backgrounds, professional experiences and ages. At the higher level of positions of responsibility (Managers, Deputy Managers, Assistant Managers) the participation of women in the total of positions is 43.5%. Moreover, the totality of Internal Auditor positions in the Company is at present covered by women. 3. In any case, the range of the Company's activities requires the contribution of skills and experience of a diverse range of people, therefore the diversity in the Company is applied in practice and not just theoretically. The Company is an equal opportunities employer and observes very seriously its obligations under the relevant law, i.e. Part A of Law 4443/2016 on "Implementation of the Principle of Equal Treatment".

According to the Company's Articles of Association, the Company's shares and rights deriving therefrom are indivisible and, in case of joint ownership, the joint owners exercise their rights through a common representative, whereas each joint owner is jointly and severally liable to the Company for the fulfillment of the obligations deriving from the share.

COSCO SHIPPING (Hong Kong) Co., Limited is 100% held by China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company, which is 100% held by China COSCO SHIPPING Corporation Limited, a Chinese stateowned company. As a result, China COSCO SHIPPING Corporation Limited, by indirectly holding 100% of COSCO SHIPPING (Hong Kong) CO., Limited, indirectly holds 51% of the voting rights in the Company.

Independent auditor's report
To the Shareholders of "Piraeus Port Authority S.A."
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Our opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Piraeus Port Authority S.A (Company) which comprise the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2018, the statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flow statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2018, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union and comply with the statutory requirements of Codified Law 2190/1920.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), as they have been transposed into Greek Law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
During our audit we remained independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) that has been transposed into Greek Law, and the ethical requirements of Law 4449/2017 and of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, that are relevant to the audit of the financial statements in Greece. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with Law 4449/2017, Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 and the requirements of the IESBA Code. We declare that the non-audit services that we have provided to the Company and its subsidiaries are in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of the applicable law and regulation and that we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided to the Company and its subsidiaries, in the period during the year ended as at 31 December 2018, are disclosed in the note 24 to the financial statements.

Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters
Recoverability of Deferred Tax asset calculated on bad debt provision

Our procedures in relation to the Key Audit Matters Our audit approach included the following key procedures:

As described in Note 8, in the non-current

We focused on this key audit matter due to the magnitude of this DTA, as well as the significant level of judgement exercised by

management for the accounting estimate and the outcome of the actions taken in order to gain the tax benefit from the write off of these receivables in the future.

 We reviewed the actions taken by management in order to follow up with the tax authorities on the progress of the notice letter submitted in 2017 to the relevant tax authorities where management had stated their intention to utilize the tax benefit (use the DTA) at the time they will write off the long outstanding receivables.

Based on the work performed, we considered that management's rationale for the recognition of the DTA on the long outstanding receivables was supported by the applicable tax legislation at the time the provision was built. Nevertheless, until such time as a response is received from the Ministry of Finance uncertainty exists as regards the utilization of the tax benefit.

Page 62  120

Contingent liabilities and provisions arising from litigation

Our audit approach included the following key procedures:

The Company faces a number of threatened and actual legal proceedings (see Note 30 Commitments and contingent liabilities par. A and Note 15). The level of provisioning and / or the level of disclosure required involves a high level of judgement resulting in provisions and contingent liabilities being considered as a key audit matter.

 We obtained the analysis of provisions established and we compared them to lists provided by the legal department with no exceptions.
 Where relevant we obtained external legal confirmations directly requested by us.
 We discussed a selection of open cases and their possible outcome with company's legal department and/or external lawyers.

Based on evidence obtained we determined the level of provisioning at December 31,2018 to be appropriate (Note 15 Provisions).We also consider that disclosures in Note 30 are deemed to be sufficient.

Other Information The members of the Board of Directors are responsible for the Other Information. The Other Information, which is included in the Annual Report in accordance with Law 3556/2007, is the Statements of Board of Directors members and the Board of Directors Report (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Other Information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this section of our Report, we do not express an audit opinion or other form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Other Information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
We considered whether the Board of Directors Report includes the disclosures required by Codified Law 2190/1920 and the Corporate Governance Statement required by article 43bb of Codified Law 2190/1920 has been prepared.
Based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit, in our opinion:
 The information given in the the Board of Directors' Report for the year ended at 31 December 2018 is consistent with the financial statements,
 The Board of Directors' Report has been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of articles 43a of the Codified Law 2190/1920,
 The Corporate Governance Statement provides the information referred to items c and d of paragraph 1 of article 43bb of the Codified Law 2190/1920.

In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified material misstatements in the Board of Directors' Report and Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report. We have nothing to report in this respect.

Page 63  120

Responsibilities of Board of Directors and those charged with governance for the financial statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union and comply with the requirements of Codified Law 2190/1920, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Page 64  120

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
1. Additional Report to the Audit Committee
Our opinion on the accompanying financial statements is consistent with our Additional Report to the Audit Committee of the Company
2. Appointment
We were first appointed as auditors of the Company by the decision of the annual general meeting of shareholders on 30 June 2016. Our appointment has been renewed annually by the decision of the annual general meeting of shareholders for a total uninterrupted period of appointment of 3 years.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
(a) Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (E.U.). These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost and going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements according to the IFRS requires estimates and assumptions to be made by the management, influencing the assets and liabilities amounts, the disclosure of potential receivable and liabilities as at the financial statements date, as well as the revenue and expenditure amounts, during the financial period. Actual results may differ from these estimations. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the accounting policies which have been adopted. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 2(c).
Management continuously assesses the situation and the possible future impacts in order to ensure that all necessary actions and initiatives are undertaken to minimize possible consequences for the Company's activities. Management cannot accurately forecast the possible developments in the Greek economy; however, based on its assessment, Management has reached the conclusion that no additional impairment provisions of the financial and non-financial assets of the Company are required on December 31, 2018.
Certain line items of the previous year's financial statements were reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation.
(b) Approval of Financial Statements
The Board of Directors of the Company approved the financial statements for the year ended at December 31, 2018, on February 14, 2019. The abovementioned financial statements are subject to the final approval of the Annual General Assembly of the Shareholders.
(c) Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates
The Company makes estimates and judgments in order to select the most appropriate accounting principles taking into consideration the future outcome of events and transactions. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and judgments that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
(i) Allowance for doubtful accounts receivables and legal cases: Management periodically reassess the adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable following an expected credit losses (`ECLs') approach. The expected loss rate is assessed on the basis of historical credit losses adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive policy and taking into consideration reports from its legal department. For the allowance of legal cases management assesses the probability of negative outcome, as well as possible payment amounts for their settlement.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
(ii) Provision for income taxes: According to IAS 12, income tax provisions are based on estimations as to the taxes that shall be paid to the tax authorities and includes the current income tax for each fiscal year, the provision for additional taxes which may arise from future tax audits and the recognition of future tax benefits. The final clearance of income taxes may be different from the relevant amounts which are included in these financial statements.
(iii) Deferred tax assets on provisions of bad debts: Deferred tax assets are recognized for provisions of bad debts to the extent that it is probable that, based on tax law, the Company has the right to proceed with the tax deduction of the related provision. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the particular actions that have been taken (seizure, auction, filling of relevant lists to the tax authorities etc.) in order to record a provision for bad debts.
(iv) Depreciation rates: The Company's assets are depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives. These useful lives are periodically reassessed to determine whether the original period continues to be appropriate. The actual lives of these assets can vary depending on a variety of factors such as technological innovation and maintenance programs.
(v) Impairment of property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. When value in use calculations are undertaken, management estimates the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit and chooses a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Company's management having assessed the segment report (Note 22) has identified indications of impairment for Pier I and has used discounted cash flows to calculate the value in use, using cash flow projections from financial budgets covering a period of thirty-three years. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.10%.  sensitivity analysis was performed on positive or negative discount rate changes and revenue of 0.25% and 0.50% respectivelly. The value in use was higher than the carrying value of Pier I, consequently, no impairment loss was recognized.
(vi) Contingent liabilities: The existence of contingent liabilities requires from management to make assumptions and estimates continuously related to the possibility that future events may or may not occur as well as the effects that those events may have on the activities of the Company.
(vii) Provision for staff leaving indemnities:The cost for staff leaving indemnities is determined based on actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation requires management to make assumptions about future salary increases, discount rates, mortality rates, etc. Management, at each reporting date when the provision is re-examined, tries to give its best estimate regarding the above mentioned parameters.

3. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company applies the following accounting policies for the preparation of the accompanying financial statements:
(a) Tangible Assets: Buildings, technical projects and other building installations are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and possible impairment provision. The privately owned land, machinery and other equipment, acquired before PPA's conversion into an S.A., 1.6.1999, were valued at deemed cost, arising by the Evaluation Committee of article 9 C.L. 2190/1920, while those acquired afterwards are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and possible value impairment provision.
Acquisition cost of a building installation or equipment consists of purchase price include import duties, plus non-refundable purchase taxes as well as any cost required for the asset to become operational. Repairs and maintenance are posted to the financial period in which they were incurred. Significant additions and improvements made at a later stage are capitalized in the relevant asset cost.
Fixed assets constructed by the Company are posted to the self-construction cost which includes subcontractors' fees, materials and technicians' payroll costs involved in the construction (including relevant employer contributions) as well as part of general administration expenses.
Assets under construction include fixed assets under construction and are stated at their cost. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the fixed assets are complete and operational.
(b) Depreciation: Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis according to the following useful lives per fixed asset category:

Fixed Asset Categories Buildings, technical & port projects Machinery & other equipment Motor Vehicles Floating transportation means Furniture, fixture & fittings

Useful Life (years) 25-40 10-30 5-12 20-35 5-10

The residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method of the Company's assets are examined annually and they are adjusted if necessary.
(c) Impairment of non-current financial assets: Property, plant & equipment and intangible fixed assets must be evaluated for possible impairment loss, when there are indications that the asset's book value is over its recoverable amount. When an asset's book value is over its recoverable amount, the respective impairment loss is posted to the period financial results. An asset's recoverable value is the greater amount between the fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified separately (cash generating units). Impairment losses recognized in prior periods in non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date for any reversal.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
(d) Investment property: Investment property that includes land and buildings is held by the Company for long-term rental yields and not for own use. Investment property is measured at cost less depreciation and impairment.
When the carrying amounts of the investment property exceed their recoverable amounts, the difference (impairment) is charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income. Land is not depreciated. The depreciation of buildings is calculated using the straight line method over the buildings' useful life which is 30 years.
Transfers are made to investment property when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by the end of owner occupation.
(e) Fixed Asset Subsidies: Subsidies are considered as deferred revenue and are recognized as income at the same depreciation rate as the relevant subsidized fixed assets are depreciated. This income is deducted from the depreciation in the period financial results.
(f) Intangible Assets: Intangible assets include software purchase cost and any expenditure for software development. Software depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis and its useful life of 3-4 years.
(g) Borrowing Cost: The Company has adopted the basic accounting policy suggested by IAS 23, where the borrowing cost recognized as expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
(h) Financial Instruments: Initial recognition and subsequent measurement A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
i) Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets of the Company are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, and fair value through profit or loss.
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient, the Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the `solely payments of principal and interest' test and is performed at an instrument level.
The Company's business model for managing financial assets refers to how the Company manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.
Page 75  120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
 Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)  Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt
instruments)  Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and
losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) This category is the most relevant to the Company. The Company measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
 The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows And
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
The Company's financial assets at amortised cost includes trade and other receivables.
Derecognition of financial asset A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when:  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired Or  The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a `pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. The Company transfers a financial asset if, and only if, it either:  transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset Or
Page 76  120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
 retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement.
When the Company transfers a financial asset, it shall evaluate the extent to which retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In this case:  if the Company transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the entity shall derecognise the financial asset and recognise separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.  if the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Company shall continue to recognise the financial asset.  if the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, shall determine whether it has retained control of the financial asset. In this case:
(i) if the Company has not retained control, it shall derecognise the financial asset and recognise separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
(ii) if the Company has retained control, it shall continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset.
Impairment of financial assets The Company recognise an allowance for expected credit losses for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
For trade and other receivables, the Company apply a simplified approach in calculating expected credit losses Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. For other financial assets, the ECL is based on the 12-month ECL. The 12-month ECL is the portion of lifetime ECLs that results from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. However, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL. The Company considered the risk of default, the days past due and the historical credit losses experienced adjusted to reflect current and forwardlooking information per debtor to measure the expected credit losses for each individual trade and other receivable balance.
At each reporting date, the Company assess whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly from the initial recognition. The Company consider a financial asset in default when contractual payments past due over the Company's credit policy. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
ii) Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities of the Company are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, trade and other payables.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts.
Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:
Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Loans and borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company has the right to defer settlement for at least twelve months from the date of financial position date.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are obligations for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business by suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade account payables subsequent to the initial recognition are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Page 78  120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
iii) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(i) Cash on hand and in banks: The Company considers as cash (apart from cash on hand) time deposits and liquid investments maturing in three months from the acquisition date.
(j) Provisions: Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase of the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a borrowing cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date, and if it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, they are reversed. Provisions are used only for expenditures for which they were originally recognized. No provisions are recognized for future operating losses. Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognized.
(k) Income Tax (Current and Deferred): Current and deferred income tax assessment are based on the relevant amounts of the financial statements, according to tax Laws effective in Greece. Current income tax concerns tax on the Company taxable profits, adjusted according to Greek tax Law and calculated using the current tax rate. Deferred tax is assessed using the liability method in all temporary tax differences on the balance- sheet date between the tax base and the accounting value of assets and liabilities. The expected tax consequences from the temporary tax differences are assessed and stated either as deferred tax liabilities or as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are posted to the financial statements for all allowable temporary differences and tax losses carried forward as far as it is likely to set off these allowable temporary differences against available taxable profits. The accounting value of deferred tax assets is revised at each balance- sheet date and it is reduced up to the point that it is not likely to have enough taxable profits, where part or all of the deferred tax assets may be set off against. Current income tax receivable and liabilities for current and previous financial years are valued at the amount expected to be paid to Tax Authorities (or be refunded by them), using the tax rates (and tax Laws) in force up to the balance- sheet date.

(l) Revenue Recognition: Revenue is the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring promised services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (value-added tax, other sales taxes etc.).
Revenue is recognized when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of a promised service to the customer. A customer obtains control of a service if it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that service. Control is transferred over time or at a point in time when the service is provided to the customer.
Management has determined that contracts in general comprise of a single performance obligation and prices are fixed, based on stand-alone selling prices derived from price lists. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the service is provided to the customer.
Revenue arising from services is recognised at a point in the time in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, and it is measured based on stand-alone selling prices derived from price lists.
A receivable is recognised when there is an unconditional right to consideration for the performance obligations to the customer that are satisfied.
A contract asset is recognized when the performance obligation to the customer is satisfied before the customers pays or before payment is due, usually when services are transferred to the customer before the Company has a right to invoice.
A contract liability is recognized when there is an obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from the customer (prepayments) or there is an unconditional right to receive consideration before the Company transfers a service (deferred income). The contract liability is derecognized when the promise is fulfilled and revenue is recorded in the profit or loss statement.
(m) Inventories: Materials and spare parts related to the Company mechanical equipment maintenance are valued at the lower of acquisition cost and net realisable value and their cost is determined on the weighted average cost basis. Net realizable value is estimated based on the current selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses. Materials are posted to inventories on purchase and recognized as expenditure on consumption.
(n) Leases: Leases that actually convey to the Company all dangers and benefits relevant to the leased asset are classified as financial leases. Leased fixed assets are capitalized at the beginning of the lease at their fair value or at present value of total minimum finance lease payments, if the latter is lower. Financial lease payments are allocated between financial expenditure and financial liabilities reduction in order to achieve a fixed interest rate for the remaining liability balance. Financial expenditure is debited directly in the period financial results. Capitalized leased fixed assets are depreciated according to their expected useful life.
When the lessor retains all risk and rewards of fixed asset, then these leases are classified as operational leases. Operational lease payments are recognized as expenditure in the Income Statement on a regular basis during the lease.
Revenue from rental income arising, from operating leases, is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

(o) Defined benefit plan: The provision for staff termination indemnities recorded in the statement of financial position for the defined benefit plan is the present value of the liability for the defined benefit in addition to changes occurring from any other actuarial profit or loss and the past service cost. The discount rate is considered as the yield, at the balance sheet date, of high quality European corporate bonds which have a maturity which approaches the time period of the Company's liability. The liability for this plan is determined using the projected unit credit method from an independent valuer and includes the present value of accrued services during the year, the interest on future liabilities, the prior service cost and the actuarial gains or losses. Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets, are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to the actuarial differences reserve through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not classified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of: · The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and · The date that the Company recognizes restructuring-related costs
Workers are compensated in accordance with the provisions of L. 2112/1920, as these are applied also to employees, and cannot exceed the limit set by L. 173/67 for the broader public sector, as well as the provisions of cases 2 & 3 of subparagraph IA.12 of L. 4093/2012. According to the Collective PPA SA Employee agreement (28/12/2017, article 8,) any employee who fulfills the conditions for retirement, upon his leaving, is eligible to receive the retirement allowance of  30.000. (p) National Insurance Programs: The obligation for main or supplementary pension provision is covered by the main National Insurance Department (IKA- Social Insurance Institute) which concerns private sector and provides retirement, medical and pharmaceutical services. Each employee is obliged to contribute part of his salary to the National Insurance Department, while part of the total contribution is paid by the Company. On employee retirement the National Insurance Department is responsible for their pension payments. Therefore, the Company has no legal or presumed obligation for future payments according to this program. The employees of PPA are entitled upon retirement an allowance from the Unified Fund for Supplementary Benefits and Lump-sum Benefits (P) according to the statutory provisions of the Fund and the Law N. 2084/92.

For the two welfare sectors, dockworkers and employees of PPA, the granted amount is currently determined on the basis of the provisions of article 35 of Law N.4387 / 12-05-2016 (FEK), considering the average of the total remuneration ­ without accounting holiday bonus on which were calculated social insurance contributions for welfare for the five-year period 2009-2013 and with the employee's work year experience until 31/12/2013. To this amount is added the total of insurance contributions for welfare from 01/01/2014 and afterwards. Every employee is required to contribute a part of his monthly salary to the fund, while part of the total contribution is covered by the Company. This fund is a legal public company and is responsible for paying the above benefits to employees. Consequently, the Company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay future benefits under this plan.
(q) Earnings per Share: Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the financial period net profit, corresponding to ordinary shareholders, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares issued. The accompanying financial statements did not include any profit decreasing bonds or other stock, convertible to shares. Consequently, diluted earnings per share were not calculated.
(r) Dividends: Dividends are accounted for when receipt rights are finalized by the resolution of the shareholders general meeting.
(s) Concession Agreement to PPA S.A.: In persuasion of the 35th article of 2932/2001 Law, Greek Government and the Company signed on 13.2.2002 the Concession Agreement, by which the government transfers its exclusive right of use and exploitation of port zone lands, buildings and facilities of Piraeus Port to the Company.
This concession was agreed for fixed period initial duration of 40 years, beginning on the day the agreement and ending on 13.2.2042. The initial duration is possible to be extended once or several times by Law. A new written agreement and modification of the 4.1 article of the Concession Agreement. With the Common Ministry Decision (CMD) no. 8322/3-12-2008, published in Government Paper 2372/21-11-2008, the Concession Agreement duration has been modified from 40 to 50 years, beginning on the 13/2/2002 (initial signature date) and ending on the respective date of the year 2052.
Management has examined whether the contract for the concession of the exclusive right to use and exploit land, buildings and facilities at the Port of Piraeus Land Zone fall under the scope of the provisions of Interpretation 12. Management concluded that the concession does not fall under the scope of application of Interpretation 12, as it is an operating lease based on IAS 17.
Government has received 1% of the Company's consolidated annual income for each of the first 3 years of the concession. The above percentage has increased to 2% of the Company's consolidated annual income after the 3rd year, on the same calculation basis. Based on the new Concession Agreement signed on 24.6.2016 the percentage to Greek State has increased to 3.5% of the Company's consolidated annual income excluding finance income.

According to the above, the payment of the guaranteed consideration was suspended until 31.12.2021 and has been replaced by paying only Variable consideration that arises as a percentage on consolidated revenues of PCT SA from the previous contract year.
The calculation of fixed consideration I & II is adjusted regarding the length of exploitation and the corresponding sq.m (Note 21). The concession consideration is calculated and recognized in income for the period in accordance with the terms of the contract and considered as operating lease in accordance with IAS 17.

Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the annual financial statements, are consistent with those followed for the year ended December 31, 2017, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations applicable for fiscal periods beginning at January 1, 2018. However, those standards have either no significant effect on the Financial Statement of the Company, or no application for the Company.
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations: Certain new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company's evaluation of the effect of these new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations is as follows:
Standards and Interpretations effective for the current financial year
IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" and subsequent amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018)
IFRS 9 replaces the guidance in IAS 39 which deals with the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and it also includes an expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model that was applied under IAS 39. IFRS 9 establishes a more principlesbased approach to hedge accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the previous model in IAS 39.
The Company applied the standard retrospectively without restatement of the comparative information for prior years, on January 1, 2018. Therefore the adjustments arising from impairment rules are not reflected in the statement of financial position on December 31, 2017, but are recognised in the opening statement of financial position on 1 January 2018.
The Company applied the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses (ECLs) on the trade and other receivables balances at the date of initial application. The result of the new requirements was an increase in the Company's impairment allowance for doubtful debts of  138,455.83 with a corresponding impact in the opening retained earnings.
There was no impact from the classification and measurement of the financial assets and liabilities of the Company.
IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"
IFRS 15 has been issued in May 2014. The objective of the standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. It contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognised. The underlying principle is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The new standard establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The standard requires entities to exercise judgement, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their customers. The standard also specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.

(amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)

The Company performed an assessment on its revenue streams based on the five steps prescribed in the standard in order to identify any impacted areas. Management has determined that contracts in general comprise of a single performance obligation and prices are fixed, based on stand-alone selling prices derived from price lists. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the service is provided to the customer.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 15 by using the modified retrospective approach, meaning that the cumulative impact of the adoption was recognized in retained earnings and comparatives were not restated. The result of the adoption was an increase in the Company's contract liabilities of  230,650.00 with a corresponding impact in the opening retained earnings. As of December 31, 2018 a contract liability amounting to  273,874.00 has been recognized and is included in accrued and other current liabilities (Note 20).
The following table summarizes the adjustments recognised for each individual line item of the statements of financial position on January 1, 2018, because of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15:

ASSETS Non current assets Property, Plant and Equipment Investment property Intangible assets Other non-current assets Deferred tax assets

IFRS 4 (Amendments) "Applying IFRS 9 Financial instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance contracts" The amendments introduce two approaches. The amended standard: a) gives all companies that issue insurance contracts the option to recognise in other comprehensive income, rather than profit or loss, the volatility that could arise when IFRS 9 is applied before the new insurance contracts standard is issued; and b) gives companies, whose activities are predominantly connected with insurance, an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 until 2021. The entities that have elected to defer the application of IFRS 9 continue to apply the existing financial instruments standard--IAS 39. The IFRS 4 is not applicable for the Company. IFRS 2 (Amendments) "Classification and measurement of Shared-based Payment transactions" The amendment clarifies the measurement basis for cash-settled, share-based payments and the accounting for modifications that change an award from cash-settled to equity-settled. It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equitysettled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee's tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority. The IFRS 2 is not applicable for the Company. IAS 40 (Amendments) "Transfers of Investment Property" The amendments clarified that to transfer to, or from, investment properties there must be a change in use. To conclude if a property has changed use there should be an assessment of whether the property meets the definition and the change must be supported by evidence. IFRIC 22 "Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration" The interpretation provides guidance on how to determine the date of the transaction when applying the standard on foreign currency transactions, IAS 21. The interpretation applies where an entity either pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign currency-denominated contracts. The IFRIC 22 is not applicable for the Company. Annual Improvements to IFRS 2014 (2014 ­ 2016 Cycle) IAS 28 "Investments in associates and Joint ventures"
The amendments clarified that when venture capital organisations, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities use the election to measure their investments in associates or joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), this election should be made separately for each associate or joint venture at initial recognition.
Page 86 of 120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
Standards and Interpretations effective for subsequent periods
IFRS 9 (Amendments) "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).The amendments allow companies to measure particular prepayable financial assets with so-called negative compensation at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income if a specified condition is met--instead of at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 16 "Leases" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).IFRS 16 has been issued in January 2016 and supersedes IAS 17. The objective of the standard is to ensure the lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently.
The Company will adopt the standard the date of its mandatory application on January 1, 2019, and will apply the standard on the basis of the simplified method without restating the comparatives amounts. The Company also will use the short and low-value leases exception provided by the standard. The Company access that will recognize the amount of approximately  65.3 million as the right of use of asset with a corresponding liability due to its exclusive right of use and exploitation of port zone land, buildings and facilities of Piraeus Port granted to the Company by the Greek State until 2052, in exchange of an annual percentage payment based on Company's income with a minimum annual fee of  3.5 million. The incremental borrowing cost was calculated taking into account the reference rate plus an indebtedness and credit spread as well as sovereign risk margin. The effect on annual earnings before income taxes, interest and depreciation/amortisation of the application of the Standard will be positive by approximatelly  3.5 million. In addition, the Company has assessed and will recognize on January 1, 2019 the right of use of finance lease motor vehicles which will have no significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
IFRS 17 "Insurance contracts" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021).IFRS 17 has been issued in May 2017 and supersedes IFRS 4. IFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard and its objective is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. The new standard solves the comparison problems created by IFRS 4 by requiring all insurance contracts to be accounted for in a consistent manner. Insurance obligations will be accounted for using current values instead of historical cost. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IAS 28 (Amendments) "Long term interests in associates and joint ventures" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).The amendments clarify that companies account for long-term interests in an associate or joint venture--to which the equity method is not applied--using IFRS 9. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRIC 23 "Uncertainty over income tax treatments" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).The interpretation explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. IFRIC 23 applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is such uncertainty, including taxable profit or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates. The interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IAS 19 (Amendments) "Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).The amendments specify how companies determine pension expenses when changes to a defined benefit pension plan occur. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Page 87 of 120

PIRAEUS PORT AUTHORITY S.A Annual Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (amounts in Euro unless stated otherwise)
IFRS 3 (Amendments) "Definition of a business" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amended definition emphasises that the output of a business is to provide goods and services to customers, whereas the previous definition focused on returns in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits to investors and others. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. IAS 1 and IAS 8 (Amendments) "Definition of a material" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments clarify the definition of material and how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance which until now was featured elsewhere in IFRS. In addition, the explanations accompanying the definition have been improved. Finally, the amendments ensure that the definition of material is consistent across all IFRS. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Annual Improvements to IFRS (2015 ­ 2017 Cycle) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).The amendments set out below include changes to four IFRSs. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. IFRS 3 "Business combinations" The amendments clarify that a company remeasures its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains control of the business. IFRS 11 "Joint arrangements" The amendments clarify that a company does not remeasure its previously held interest in a joint operation when it obtains joint control of the business. IAS 12 "Income taxes" The amendments clarify that a company accounts for all income tax consequences of dividend payments in the same way. IAS 23 "Borrowing costs" The amendments clarify that a company treats as part of general borrowings any borrowing originally made to develop an asset when the asset is ready for its intended use or sale. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

Receivables from project contractor of Pier I: This claim represents the difference found in incorrect data application on some review rates of the Ministry (IPEXODE) and was recognized by the project contractor of Pier I. At March 9, 2012 the Company and the project contractor of Pier I consigned an "extrajudicial agreement of debt acknowledgment", under which the requirement from the later will be paid in seven (7) instalments up to December 31, 2012. Then on the 24th of September, 2012, the request of the contractor of the project "Pier I' was partially approved and the debt settled in fourteen (14) monthly instalments starting from September 30, 2012 onwards until October 31, 2013.
Due to non-compliance of settlement, the PPA held in October 2013 in forfeiture contractor's guarantee letters for accrued interest of  1.5 million and is expected to debate the re-settlement agreement instalments.
Furthermore, due to this non-compliance of settlement, the Company, through its Board of Directors, decided on the 24th of February 2014 to exercise any remedy and recourse to any procedure for the forced recovery of its claim.

Receivable from compulsory seizure of municipality: The Municipality of Piraeus proceeded to the compulsory seizure of the amount of  6,285,940.08 against the Company, for municipal charges of cleaning and lighting as well as electrified land taxes over the past years that were imposed on the Company. After the final court decisions issued during 2017, the Municipality of Piraeus was forced to return immediately (within 2018) the amount of  4,764,851.71 (Note 10). For the remaining withheld amount of  1,521,088.37, the final decision by the court is expected. According to the Company's Legal Department, the cancellation of all charges against the Company is expected considering the virtual certainty. On January 29 2018, the Municipality of Piraeus deposited in favour of PPA the amount of  4,608,844.90.

During the prior year, the Company reassessed the deferred tax assets and proceeded with impairment by the amount of  3,639,276.83 which relates to a deferred tax asset from a write-off of bad debts that is not expected to be offset in the future. An additional amount of deferred tax asset of  991,878.25 on prior year provision for bad debts was recognized by the Company.
The deferred tax asset balance has been built mainly in previous years (before 2016) when the Company was operating under specific legislation Law 1559/1950 and Law 2688/1999. According to these the Company believes that they have taken the ultimate possible measure for collecting a long outstanding receivable balance which is to assign those balances to tax department for collection. For such balances of  25 million for which the company has recorded  6.3 million deferred tax asset the Company intends to utilize this deferred asset when they will write off these balances in the future. That intention was declared in a notice letter to the Ministry of Finance but no response has been received yet. A response is critical for any future action to be determined by the Company.

On 1 January 2018, the Company applied the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses (ECLs) on the trade and other receivables balances at the date of initial application. The result of the new requirements was an increase in the Company's impairment allowances of  138,455.83 with a corresponding impact in the opening retained earnings.

(1,471,673.20) 39,698,921.72

The reversal of the provision of  1,473,250.14 concerns two customers who, during the current period, repaid part of their debt and for which provision for doubtful debts had been made in prior years. The provision utilized for the current period of  41,116.80 relates to the write-off of a customer's debt for which a provision for doubtful debts had been made in previous years.

During the year ended December 31, 2017 the Company negotiated with Ship Repair Zone users in order to reassess and settle outstanding debts and set the basis of new contracts for the extension of ship repair zone space utilization. The outcome of the negotiations has been ratified through the Annual General Assembly of June 28, 2017. The Company has written off outstanding debts of  1,609,760,00 and reversed the related provision of  1,471,673.20, while the remaining balance is included in "Other operating expenses" (Note 25).

For trade receivables and other receivables, the Company has calculated estimated credit losses (ECLs) based on lifetime expected credit losses. Taking into consideration that trade receivables are normally settled within 10 days from the issuance of the invoice, the risk of default and the expected loss rate of 0.5% has been determined by management whereas for all balances that are outstanding for more than 10 days, the Company has considered the risk of default, the days past due and the historical credit losses experienced adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information per debtor to measure the expected credit losses for each individual trade receivable balance.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables (net of ECLs) is as follows:

Fair Value: The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying sheets of financial position for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, prepayments, trade and other accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
The fair value of variable rate loans and borrowings approximate the amounts appearing in the statements of financial position.
The Company categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value in three categories, defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) values from active financial markets for identical negotiable assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value are identified or determined directly or indirectly from active financial markets.
Level 3: Techniques that use inflows that have a significant impact on the recorded fair value and are not based on quoted prices from active financial markets.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.

As at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held the following financial instruments:

Foreign Exchange Risk: The Company is neither involved in international trade nor has any long term loans in foreign currency and therefore is not exposed to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign currency rate variations.
Interest rate risk: The Company bank loans are expressed in Euro and are subject to floating interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives in financial instruments in order to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk fluctuation as at the balance-sheet date. The Company management believes that there is no significant risk resulting from a possible interest rate fluctuation.
