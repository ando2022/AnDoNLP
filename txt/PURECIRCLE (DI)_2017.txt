COMPANY INFORMATION

Inside consumer and
macro trends
With consumers increasingly following a health and wellness agenda, driven by growing global concerns about obesity and diabetes, as well as government involvement and levies on sugar, many global food and beverage companies have committed to reduce sugar quantities. So, demand for natural-origin, zero-calorie stevia sweeteners and flavours has grown and grown. PureCircle is dedicated to helping food and beverage companies quickly develop products that retain the great taste that consumers love, whilst reducing sugar content and overall calories.

INTRODUCTION

The evolution of
great taste
Our stevia experts are dedicated to understanding all parts of the stevia leaf and how they impact taste. This knowledge and drive for the next taste breakthrough has led to the development of a range of products that provide a sugar-like taste and deep calorie reductions, which have allowed the global stevia market to move away from Reb A 97. We have developed an extensive portfolio of stevia ingredients, and have over 72 granted stevia-related patents and 200 patents pending. We work alongside our customers as innovation partners to deliver stevia solutions best suited to each unique product ­ be they off-the-shelf solutions, such as those from the sigma family, or custom formulations ­ often combining stevia ingredients to get the best results. With the largest extraction facilities in the world, we can deliver innovative stevia products at a scale that services the demands of the global food and beverage industry.

INTRODUCTION

From leaf to
product
Industry-defining innovation starts from the ground up ­ with the cultivation of the stevia plant. In this, no other Company has invested more. Our PureCircle Stevia Agronomy Programme and resultant proprietary stevia leaf varieties, such as StarLeaf stevia, are the source of our many taste breakthroughs. StarLeaf stevia contains 20% more steviol glycoside content than standard leaf varieties; its extract offers food and beverage developers a plant-based, zerocalorie sugar alternative that delivers more upfront sweetness, no bitter linger and that much sought-after sugar-like taste. We have been able to maximize the potential of this amazing little leaf by perfecting natural, cross-pollination methods, and scaling responsibly to meet the F&B industry demand for consistently high-quality stevia ingredients. And, as the only stevia Company with a vertically integrated supply chain, we can trace all our stevia ingredients back to the field in which they were grown.

CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION
During the year, we made significant investments in our future including the completion, on time and on budget, of our $42 million refinery expansion in Malaysia.

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017

Paul Selway-Swift Chairman

Welcome to the PureCircle FY2017 Annual Report. The downturn in sales and overall performance reported herein is a disappointment to Directors as it will be to shareholders.
In May 2016, the US Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") issued a Withhold Release Order ("WRO") which affectively closed the US market, our biggest, to us for a period of 8 months. After a period of intensive forensic investigation, the WRO was lifted in January 2017. The impact of this WRO was significant and its impact continues to be felt. Outside the US we achieved strong double digit growth in all our main markets.
During the year, we made significant investments in our future including the completion, on time and on budget, of our $42 million refinery expansion in Malaysia. This will ensure we have the capacity to deliver our latest products to our customers globally.
The global stevia market continues to grow and we believe that we are better placed than our competitors to deliver to the world's food and beverage companies the low calorie, great tasting natural sweeteners that their consumers demand.

THE BOARD
Peter Lai, after serving 9-years as an Independent Non-Executive Director retired as a Director in March. He will, however, continue to be associated with PureCircle in China where his knowledge will be valuable in his role as Chairman of PureCircle Jiangxi. We are fortunate to have somebody of John Gibney's experience to succeed Peter as Chairman of our Audit Committee. Following an absence of 3-years owing to other business commitments we are delighted to welcome John Slosar back to our Board.
Rakesh Sinha has now completed his first year as Chief Financial Officer and is making a valuable contribution to the Company.
THE PEOPLE
I would like to thank every one of the 1,100 people at PureCircle for their hard work and dedication to the Company in what has been an extremely challenging year due the WRO issued in the US.
LOOKING AHEAD
As we move ahead following the setback from the issue of the WRO in the US the future looks bright and we look forward to reporting strong progress in the future.

Strategic Report
OUR MARKET
Global obesity and diabetes epidemics continue to worsen with recent figures estimating that at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese.

Meanwhile, the estimated diabetes prevalence for adults between the ages of 20 and 70 worldwide is expected to affect one person in 10 by 2040 ­ 642 million.
As a result, governments across the world have introduced regulations on the use of sugar in food and beverage products. Currently, eight countries have implemented a sugar tax, in addition to eight US localities and eight island territories. Further, in line with a growing health and wellness agenda, consumers are increasingly seeking products made with natural, sustainable ingredients. Driven by consumer demand, as well as government involvement and levies on sugar, many global food and beverage companies have committed to reduce sugar quantities in their products.
As global demand for natural-origin, zerocalorie stevia sweeteners and flavours has grown and grown, ingredients made from the stevia plant have become an increasingly important tool for food and beverage companies.
Most experts agree that these trends are likely to continue, and in fact, may further accelerate. Continued progress in regulatory approvals for stevia are also driving wider availability. In November 2015, India approved the use of stevia as a food and beverage ingredient ­ this means that globally more than 5 billion consumers now have access to products using stevia. In early 2016, Brazil

approved the use of stevia as an ingredient permitted to be mixed with sugar and China and Indonesia approved the use of steviabased flavours, opening up significant additional market potential. Importantly, all 40+ steviol glycosides are found safe for food and beverage applications according to US FDA and JECFA, further opening up market potential for our innovation pipeline.
These trends continue to drive increased adoption of stevia by the food and beverage industry across a wider range of food and beverage categories. Mintel data shows that by the end of CY2016 more than 11,000 food and beverage products had been launched in the world containing stevia since 2011, with a 5-year CAGR of 36%. These launches span all regions of the world, across both developed and developing markets. In addition, these launches span a wide range of food and beverage categories, with the strongest growth across beverages, dairy and snacks. Notably, many of these launches have been in highawareness brands.
The food and beverage products already launched using stevia are estimated to have the potential to support an industry with market size of more than $1 billion when those products are fully rolled out and mature. The pace of adoption to-date, particularly in mainstream products, coupled with consumer concerns about obesity, provide confidence that the stevia market will develop to such a size.

Ingredients made from the stevia plant are becoming an increasingly important tool for food and beverage companies.

Obesity

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW
Our focus is to leverage our first mover advantage, IP and patent protection to deliver the best-tasting stevia in the market.

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017

Magomet Malsagov Chief Executive Officer

PureCircle has a unique market position ­ no one knows more about the stevia leaf than PureCircle as demonstrated by our 72 patents and 200 patents pending. It is true that anyone can pick a stevia leaf but our competitive advantage is in what we do with it.
We have moved way beyond the first generation, commoditised product of Reb A and are onto our third and fourth generations of stevia ­ we are unwavering in our focus on bringing the best-tasting stevia. These new generations of natural-origin stevia products are revolutionising taste.
Our expertise results from our ongoing investment in R&D into all aspects of the stevia plant. Everything we do is about helping our customers achieve their goals of reducing sugar, calories and the cost of ingredients without compromising taste. With our highest purity stevia solutions we work in partnership with our customers to achieve the taste profile they require for their products in their different markets around the globe. We are introducing new tools to help customers formulate with stevia more efficiently and quickly. That will reduce their development costs and accelerate speed to market for their products.
POWERFUL MARKET TRENDS
Powerful market trends continued to gather pace such as the global fight to combat obesity and diabetes through sugar taxes and increased regulation. Continued progress in regulatory approvals for stevia are also driving wider availability ­ today more than 5 billion customers globally have access to products using stevia.

Powerful market trends continued to gather pace such as the global fig ht to combat obesity and diabetes throug h sugar taxes and increased regulation.

There are significant opportunities for growth to support the largest food and beverage brands around the world in responding to these drivers and PureCircle is well placed to seize them.
Since 2011, we have sold enough stevia sweeteners to enable a reduction of 3.8 trillion calories from global diets. We are proud to be part of the effort to address the global obesity crisis. More than 600 million people are now estimated to be obese and 415 million estimated to have diabetes; this number is expected to more than double by 2040. Regulatory action to address these public health issues is increasing and this is coupled with consumers actively seeking natural sustainable ingredients instead of using artificial ones.
As the only vertically integrated stevia business, every element of our business is of paramount importance, every element of our business requires continual investment and nurturing. Our focus is to leverage our first mover advantage, IP and patent protection to deliver the best-tasting stevia in the market.
AGRONOMY
In everything we do, we seek to ensure that our growth is scaled in a sustainable way. Today we work with thousands of farmers around the world. By diversifying and expanding our stevia leaf supply across three continents, PureCircle has reduced geopolitical and climate risks ensuring it has the flexibility, capacity and robustness to cope with global market volatility, in whatever form that takes.
We invest in our supply chain ­ from leaf to product ­ to enable us to bring everimproving solutions to our clients, across more food categories.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S OFFICER'S REVIEW CONTINUED

This year we developed our most advanced generation of stevia yet ­ StarLeaf stevia. This is a product of the Company's longterm investment of $100 million in its PureCircle Stevia Agronomy Program, announced in 2016. StarLeaf stevia contains over 20 times more sugar-like glycoside content than standard stevia leaf varieties and will support developers in achieving deeper levels of calorific reduction in their final products without sacrificing taste. We have now moved to commercially scaling the leaf and thousands of hectares of StarLeaf are being planted.
FARMERS & COMMUNITIES
PureCircle works with thousands of farmers around the world. Our stevia crops are one of the most lucrative crops a farmer can grow ­ they have multiple harvest cycles per annum, use considerably less land and water and, because of our vertically integrated supply chain and the way we work with co-operatives ensures we have full traceability of our stevia.

PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND LABS
We completed the $42m expansion of our Malaysian plant, effectively doubling capacity. These facilities are now fully operational and focused on delivering our higher margin, stevia solutions. Our stateof-the-art facilities are delivering operating efficiencies and incorporates a dedicated line, specifically designed for the high-purity Zeta family of ingredients ­ all this will enable us to support our long-term growth ambitions and sustain our market share.
We continued to drive the reach of our business and hence greater connectivity with local markets. We opened two new offices with innovation labs in Shanghai and New Delhi. Laboratory facilities are due to be expanded in the UK, whilst in the coming year our Chicago offices will be moving to larger premises downtown to accommodate our flagship innovation centre and laboratory.

INNOVATION
Stevia has come a long way from the commoditised product of Reb A. Today the third and fourth generation stevia solutions have superb taste profiles and go further to help unlock further demand to help moderate calories naturally. During the year, our continued focus on innovation unveiled both StarLeaf stevia and our new Sigma tools that greatly facilitate our customers' work with stevia.
We also discovered new properties in the stevia leaf - vanilla and cocoa flavour enhancers as well as antioxidants. These new solutions will unlock industries outside of the sweetener market, namely cocoa, vanilla and antioxidant markets. The vanilla and cocoa flavour enhancers will significantly benefit Food & Beverage companies who will be able to use less of the high-cost vanilla and cocoa commodities in their products by using stevia to enhance those flavours. Although it has been known that stevia plants contain antioxidants, our ability to extract them from the leaf is a

major commercial advance and will further support beverage and food companies in providing their customers with health benefits and great-tasting products containing compounds commonly found in `superfoods' such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains.
These products are now in customers' hands for future commercial applications. Our commitment to continued innovation is what will ensure we remain industry leaders and provide our strong diversified customer base with the breadth and depth of applications they require.
SUSTAINABILITY
Stevia is a force for good in the world. Our involvement throughout the supply chain enables us to be a key leader in corporate social responsibility. Because the leaf is 250400 times sweeter, depending on application, than sugar; a little goes a long way. That means that one fifth of the land provides the same amount of sweetness achieved from other sweeteners made from sugar cane or corn. Less land means less water and less energy. This major impact is not just on the land but also the communities and cooperatives we work with.
Our commitment to corporate social responsibility is embedded in our corporate practices.

OPPORTUNITIES
Mintel data shows that by the end of 2016, more than 11,000 food and beverage products containing stevia had been launched in the world since 2011. These launches span all regions of the world, across both developed and developing markets. The existing products are estimated to have the potential to support a stevia industry with a market size of more than $1 billion when those products are fully rolled out and mature ­ so, we have only touched the surface, despite our market leading position.
India is an example of the substantial opportunities that exist for PureCircle where stevia was approved for use as a Food & Beverage ingredient in November 2015. This is just one of the markets where there is a significant opportunity to exploit the desire to combat the obesity and diabetes epidemics and the desire for a healthy lifestyle.
In early 2016, Brazil also followed suit and approved the use of stevia as an ingredient permitted to be mixed with sugar, and China and Indonesia approved the use of stevia-based flavours, opening up significant additional market potential.
All these elements open up market potential for PureCircle's innovation pipeline. And the reason why PureCircle will provide the winning solution globally, is because

beverage and food companies know that they can partner with PureCircle and achieve uncompromising taste profiles tailored to their individual markets.
We continue to invest in our people, systems, and vertically-integrated supply chain in order that we can achieve our aspirations.
OUTLOOK
Whilst it has been a challenging year, it was not a systemic issue - it was caused by factors beyond the Company's control. Every year, global food and beverage brands launch increasing numbers of products incorporating plant-based stevia. We are market leaders, we have the most advanced technology, and we continue to invest to ensure we consistently deliver the best-tasting stevia. We are moving forwards, stronger, are excited about the year ahead, and look forward to the future with confidence.
Magomet Malsagov Chief Executive Officer

Stevia is a force for good in the world. Our involvement throug hout the supply chain enables us to be a key leader in corporate social responsibility.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Operating in a relatively new industry, that PureCircle has pioneered, it is critical that the Group identifies, assesses and prioritises its risks. This, along with the development of appropriate mitigating actions, enables the Group to achieve its strategic objectives and protect its reputation.
The Company vision and strategy involves the creation from scratch of a new industry. The development of the Company should there be seen in three parts:
· Phase 1 (2002 to 2008): bio-tech start up
· Phase 2 (2009-2015): scaling up phase
· Phase 3 (2016 onwards): business development with the Group operating with critical mass in more markets
Understanding these phases of development is critical to understanding the dynamics of the Company's risk environment.
The Group has a formal risk management process in place to support the identification and effective management of risks across the business. It is regularly reviewed and updated for changes within the Group, the industry and the wider economy.
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The Board is ultimately responsible for the establishment and oversight of the Group's Risk Management framework which is summarised below and discussed further within the Corporate Governance Report on pages 38 to 59.

The Internal Audit function was established in FY17, provides independent assurance to Management, and the Audit Committee keeps under review the effectiveness of mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks.
A Group risk register is in place and these are summarised in a matrix which identifies the intensity of the risk: high, medium or low. Each risk is assigned a management owner and the operational process Is overseen by the Group Finance Director.
RISK MONITORING PROCESS
The Board formally reviews the Group risk register at least twice a year. For the year ended 30 June 2017, the risks facing the Group were dominated by the inclusion of PureCircle on the US CBP's WRO list. The Group underwent intensive forensic investigation and was subsequently removed from the list in January 2017. Given this episode, combined with the new industry PureCircle is pioneering, the additional risks of cyber security and CSR were included in our risk register.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are summarised on pages 24 to 27. However, these are not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of all risks currently facing the Group.

2. CYBER SECURITY

IT security threats are becoming evermore advanced and frequent with breaches expanding their reach with more sophisticated methods.
PureCircle being in a new, progressive industry is highly vigilant to these threats.

Loss of key, confidential and competitive sensitive data; innovation breakthroughs; systems crash leading to loss of information and/or core data being compromised or corrupted; industrial espionage. Resulting in significant adverse financial, reputational and regulatory impact to the organisation.

The Group has significantly stepped up its initiatives against cyber security threats by deploying a series of preventive, detective and corrective controls which act as (1) deterrent against unauthorised access; (2) monitor and alert the Organisation of any malicious/ unauthorised activity and (3) provide support for post-incident activities, close any potential control gap and prevent future occurrence.
As cyber attacks are constantly evolving, the Group's strategy is in the continued investment in next generation preventive, detective and corrective controls with advanced security and responsive features to secure our IT ecosystem. Our investment includes partnering with world class solution providers in this area ensuring each layer of PureCircle's IT landscape is protected.

5. CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE STEVIA MARKET

PureCircle has pioneered the development of the high purity stevia market and is focused on the further development of the market in terms of product innovation and investment in technology. Additionally, the Group has an operationally leveraged business model in which profitability is sensitive to volumes. The Company's future profitability is sensitive to the continued growth of the stevia market.

Loss of reputation and sales revenue as the Company was unable to fulfil US customers' orders for a greater part of 2016. Risk that future growth targets will not be achieved.

Management mitigates this risk with an active programme of new stevia product innovation to support further adoption of stevia and to enable future food and beverage formulation projects. This is supported by investment in new or expanded innovation labs (e.g. India, China), where customers are able to codevelop solutions.

External evidence, such as Mintel Data, shows continued strong growth in F&B product launches using stevia which provides confidence in there being sustainable stevia market growth over the long-term .

With the removal of PureCircle from the Withhold Release Order (WRO), sales to the US has now resumed. Recovery of volumes in this market is fully expected.

6. COMPETITION

As pioneers in the development of the stevia market, PureCircle is currently believed to have a majority share of the Global stevia market. As stevia becomes more established as a large volume mainstream F&B ingredient, more competitors may enter the stevia market with the potential to reduce the Company's market share.

Lower market share, aggressive pricing, deterioration of margins

In addition, the emergence of cheaper alternatives of stevia (artificial, genetically modified variants).

PureCircle is committed to providing the best tasting stevia for it's customers' applications. Our continued investment in R&D, innovation will maintain and develop our strong working relationships with existing and new customers.

7. MANAGEMENT RELIANCE & TALENT DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION

Stevia is a relatively new industry, as a consequence the talent pool of management with the skills and experience of working in the stevia market is smaller than that in other more established industries. The Group is reliant upon the performance of highly skilled personnel including its senior management team.
There is a risk is that as the Organisation grows, the management talent pool does not grow in tandem with Organisation's requirements.

Slower pace of growth due to lost business opportunities; competitors take advantage as a result and hence financial impact to the business.

Greater management focus on recruitment quality, industry background and internal career development.
The Group has ongoing investment in senior management retention programmes for all key managers, including the Group's Long-Term Incentive Programme (LTIP).

PureCircle is a fast growing Company with

CONCENTRATED

production chain covering both extraction and refinery. Ensuring capacity keeps up with

PRODUCTION increasing customer demand.

CAPACITY

Given the relatively early stages of the industry, it is inevitable that for a certain

period of time, the Group's production

capacity will be concentrated into specific

facilities. A catastrophic event at either facility

would impact the business.

Capacity shortage as extraction and derivative capacity get consumed causing loss of business opportunities, hence hindering growth and profitability.

The Group completed its $42m refinery expansion on FY17 facilitating significant end product capacity increase.
The Group has explored alternative manufacturing options including 3rd party toll manufacturing. In FY17, toll manufacturing was successfully trialled.

9. LEAF PROCUREMENT & SOURCING

Dried leaf from the stevia plant is Group's primary raw material and constitutes a significant proportion of the Company's variable costs of production. It follows that the Company's financial performance can be impacted by material changes in the input costs of the stevia leaf.

A significant majority of PureCircle's total leaf supply is sourced from China.

Profitability and ability to supply is impacted.

More of PureCircle's leaf is grown with larger commercial agricultural partners who are able to scale supply more quickly than traditional smallholders. This enables less variability in the sourcing, quality and hence price.
Diversification of leaf supply continues in locations outside of China, namely Latin America and Africa. In both these locations, leaf yields are increasing. We are actively doing trials in the other locations too.
Within China, the leaf is grown in 7 distinct regions across the country thereby mitigating the risk of a natural disaster to 1 or 2 regions.

10. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) AND INNOVATION

Innovation is an essential part of PureCircle's success. Protecting the results of R&D and Innovation activity is critical since fast growth of industry, inevitably, attracts new players seeking to fast-track to a market-leading position using the latest innovations in this category.
PureCircle remains in a leading position for global stevia-related patent publications. Focusing on IP protection at all levels is needed to ensure all of the Company's IP, whether patentable or not, is protected.

Others may patent innovations made by PureCircle, limiting PureCircle's ability to use its own innovations; PureCircle innovations, patentable or not, may become available to competitors allowing them faster entry to market on such innovations; PureCircle may lose opportunities to license, sell, or transfer technology.

Maintaining robust patent filing strategy and procedures to ensure that patent applications are timely filed in sync with innovations; consistent use of non-disclosure and nonanalysis agreements to protect confidentiality and ownership of innovations whether patentable or not; fostering a culture of innovation recognition and protection.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group in accordance with the requirements of provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. In assessing its viability, the Directors have considered the Group's prospects and a number of factors that affect the resilience of the Group, including the principal risks.
ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS
The context for the assessment of prospects
The Group's market, strategy and business model are each central to an understanding of its prospects.
The nature of the Group's activities is long-term and its market and business model are both seen as open ended. The core strategy of the Company remains in place and is fine-tuned to ensure it anticipates industry evolvement and maintains customer centricity.
The core matters relevant to assessing the Group's prospects include:
· Stevia is a global mass volume natural sweetener; since initial regulatory approvals the stevia market has grown steadily and is close to tipping point / reaching critical mass. All indications are, given the concern at the continued growth in the levels of global obesity and diabetes, that it will experience considerable growth for the next few decades.
· Successful participation in the stevia market requires scale to be feasible (including scale in leaf supply, extraction, refining and customer service support).
· The Group has a large invested balance sheet, representing successful investment in a vertically integrated supply chain, from leaf to end customer service on a global presence.
· Our business model is highly operationally leveraged.
Key to viability is sustainable critical mass.
ASSESSMENT OF SUSTAINABLE CRITICAL MASS
The Group achieved breakeven net profits in FY14 and since then net profits have grown strongly. In FY17, despite the US CBP significantly impacting the year, the Group has remained profitable.
Future viability is dependent upon continued growth in the stevia market and the Group continuing to secure a reasonable share of that growing market. This is considered entirely reasonable as the stevia market is expected to grow. It is currently estimated at about $200-300m in B2B sales, representing under 1 million tonnes of sugar equivalent, against global sweetener consumption in excess of 200 million tonnes of sugar equivalent. Further Mintel and other 3rd party data continues to show strong growth in food and beverage products using stevia.
PureCircle currently has a market share in excess of 50%. The longterm viability assessment is based on the Group being one of four large producers in the long-term, therefore, at present there is considerable market share upside to the viability assessment.

THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS
The Group's prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic planning process. This includes the maintenance of a rolling 5-year plan which is reviewed annually by management led by the CEO with extensive COO and CFO involvement.
Detailed financial forecasts are prepared for a rolling 5-year period. The current year operating budget is reviewed and updated monthly, with updates beyond the current year re-forecasted at the half year mark, adjusting for significant events e.g. CBP, new product launches, innovation, market and customer developments. The cash forecast is reviewed weekly and a rolling 18-month cash forecast has been implemented.
KEY ASSUMPTIONS OF THE BASE STRATEGIC PLAN
Principal assumptions in the base strategic plan include:
· Continued growth in stevia market.
· Continued growth in the Group's sales revenues, reflecting growth in the overall market and recovery in the US market.
· Expanded refinery capacity, completed in March 2017, ensures that the Group has adequate existing capacity within which to manage strong sales growth.
· Fixed costs: it is assumed that the Group's non-variable factory and SG&A overhead cost base will be managed to a rate of increase below the rate of sales growth.
· The Group will maintain its highly operationally leveraged business model.
· Working capital assumptions are that inventory levels will reduce as a percentage of sales.
The base plan assumes that positive base operating cash flow on a sustainable basis has been achieved and will continue as sales grow until further capacity expansion is required.
ASSESSMENT OF VIABILITY
Although the strategic plan represents the Directors' best estimates of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the Group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan.
These scenarios which are based on aspects of the principal risks represent severe but possible circumstances that the Group could experience.

28

The Directors consider that in the downside scenarios the Group can continue to operate profitably and within its cash and funding headroom by:
· Scaling back on stevia leaf purchases. Stevia leaf are the Group's principal variable cost and cash outflow. The Group has the ability to cut back purchases in line with reduced demand; or
· Running down inventories: for example in scenarios where there is either reduced demand for stevia or reduced supply of stevia leaf. The Group has historically maintained inventory levels equivalent to more than 6 months cost of sales. This provides management with considerable flexibility on managing stevia procurement in scenarios of uncertain demand.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
Based on their assessment of prospects and viability above, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five year period ended 30 June 2022.
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described within the Business Performance Review on pages 30 to 33. In addition, note 4 ­ Financial risk management (pages 71 to 74) to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
In making the assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecast for the period to 30 September 2018. It should be noted that the new $200m HSBC facility was excluded in any stress testing. The stressed review included a more conservative cash flow scenario with lower revenues, lower profitability margin, higher collection days, cutting back on total leaf volume purchases and other more discretionary investments, so as to mitigate pressures on liquidity. This resulted in our current cash balances reducing over time but maintaining sufficient liquidity throughout the period.
After reviewing all the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management has sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

Sales
FY17 sales decreased by $19.7m (-14%) to $118.9m. Outside of the US, +8% growth was achieved primarily driven by Europe.
Gross Margin
FY17 gross profit fell by $12.0m to $45.8m, driven by increased manufacturing costs due to lower volume throughput, higher third party manufacturing costs and higher logistics costs all stemming from the disruption to our US market sales. FY17 gross margin was 39% (FY16: 42%).
Operating Profit
FY17 Operating profit decreased by $15.6m to $17.6m primarily due to lower volumes and gross margin.
Other expenses
Principally comprise of expenses relating to the CBP issue, write-offs and reduced staff STIP & LTIP.
Finance costs
In FY17 finance costs of $5.0m (FY16 $5.3m) was consistent with previous period.
Net profit after tax
The Group recorded a $7.2m net profit in FY17 (FY16: $14.6m).
Financing and funding headroom
The Group ended FY17 with net debt of US$84.7m (FY16 US$52.9m) and cash and facility headroom of US$76.7m (FY16 US$76.3m). The Group has secured a new $200m finance facility in September 2017 from HSBC to fund future growth.

Earnings Per Share
The Group recorded an Earnings Per Share of $4.13 (2016: EPS of $8.37) in 2017, on a fully diluted basis. The diluted weighted average number of shares in issue was 175,076,000 (2016: 174,345,000).
Operating cash flow before working capital
The Group generated $21.8 million of Operating cash flow before working capital in 2017, $10.0 million lower than 2016, offset by an improvement in working capital of $8.2m.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA with other expenses (principally the charge of the Group's LTIP scheme, short-term incentive scheme, exceptional items, foreign exchange and share of gain/(loss) in joint venture) added back.
Net debt
Net debt of $84.7 million (2016: $52.9 million) has increased due to the investment in the expanded factory facility and decreased profitability.
Taxation
The tax charge of $0.4 million was 5.6% of profit before tax (2016: 18.4%). The effective tax rate for the year was lower than prior year mainly attributed by the commencement of the first tax holiday year in one of our subsidiaries, PureCircle Trading (PCT). PCT was granted a 10-year corporate income tax exemption. In addition, tax was also saved from a subsidiary, PureCircle Sdn Bhd (PCSB) where it entered the final year of its 10-year tax holiday in FY17.

POSITIVELY IMPACTING ­ THE ENVIRONMENT
The mighty stevia leaf is up to 350 times sweeter than sugar, so a little goes a long way. Only one fifth of the land is needed to provide the same amount of sweetness as you would with other natural sweeteners made from sugar cane or corn ­ less land means less water and less energy.
As a result, this leaf uses 88% less water than other natural sweeteners. It lowers its carbon footprint by 12% when being compared to cane sugar, 48% when being compare to beet sugar, and by 82% when being compare to high fructose corn syrup.
Sustainability has been integrated directly into our business from the outset ­ from the seed to the farmers to our sweeteners and flavours. It is our involvement throughout the supply chain that enables us to be a key leader in corporate social responsibility.
Stevia has a small footprint but a big impact.

POSITIVELY IMPACTING ­ PUBLIC HEALTH
PureCircle is also playing a major role in ensuring greater taste and health benefits.
Since 2011, we have provided enough stevia to eliminate 3.8 trillion calories from global diets.
We partner with our customers, and together work hard to reduce the impact that the food and beverage industry has on both the environment and the global calorific intake. We do this by developing the highest-purity stevia and applying our proprietary knowhow to enable our customers to provide consumers with the tastes they love... but with far fewer calories.

POSITIVELY IMPACTING ­ COMMUNITIES
PureCircle contracts directly with all its leaf suppliers. Included in our contracts is a Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes clauses which include strict requirements relate to farmer health and safety, appropriate business practices, fair labour practices and sustainable agriculture.
We are committed to a sustainable, fair market agricultural policy that supports thousands within farming communities around the globe. We train small-scale stevia farmers throughout the world on issues including food security, waste reduction, biodiversity, irrigation systems and more for greater yield and low impact farming. We also work to provide access to loans to our farming partners when possible.
PureCircle makes a major impact among the many communities in which it operates around the world ­ the social well-being of these communities is something that we are fully committed to. And, we are proud of the many benefits that our partnership with these communities brings such as education and access to healthcare.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED

PASSIONATE ABOUT ­ TOTAL TRACEABILITY
We believe that traceability equals transparency. Our tracking begins from the seed and carries through to harvesting right through to the end customer. From the seedling, every crop is tracked and given a unique batch number assigned linked to the specific farmer. At extraction each batch number is verified and the extraction and purification processes are recorded and assigned numbers in the tracking software system.
Once converted into finished goods, new unique numbers will be assigned if the batch is blended with any other batch and this is recorded. The stevia leaf extract can then be sent for more extraction and purification and once purified, the finished PureCircle products are then assigned an ingredient number and carefully sealed. Thus PureCircle is able to provide traceability ­ and transparency ­ from farmer to customer.
Our supply chain is regularly audited by our key customers and an independent 3rd party organisation.

PASSIONATE ABOUT ­ OUR PEOPLE
PureCircle is constantly investing in its most valuable asset ­ it's team! We want to attract and retain the industry's top talent. Our employees embody the entrepreneurial spirit which has been a part of our Company from the very beginning. In order to have the best ideas, we strive to maintain a diverse team which reflects the global landscape we work in. We believe in creating a workplace experience which cultivates career growth and provides unparalleled education experiences. We've created a culture that empowers our people to make an impact at any level of the organisation, while building meaningful relationships inside and outside of our Company.

PureCircle is able to provide exceptional traceability ­ and transparency ­ from farmer to customer.

in action
In June 2017, the Board visited the Group's stevia extraction facility, stevia nursery and plantation sites located in Jiangxi, China. The Board recognises that site visits are important to maintain an up-to-date knowledge of the Company and its operations.
The Group's extraction facility (PureCircle China) is located in Jiangxi; it operates an integrated quality system and maintains the high standards expected in the food industry (CGMP, ISO 9000, GMP, HACCP, FSSC 22000 etc). PureCircle China's management team briefed the Board on the production process flow, which was followed by a tour of the extraction facility. In this facility, a new natural gas boiler that can deliver increased steam supply had been installed to enhance production capabilities, and a new leaf warehouse was built during the year, which can store an additional 5,000MT of stevia leaf. The Board then visited the stevia nursery located within PureCircle China and stevia plantations located nearby, where they were briefed on the progress of stevia new varieties, research and development projects, and also the new stevia variety husbandry. During their site visit to Jiangxi, the Board also held the scheduled June Board meeting and met with the PureCircle China management team.

CHAIRMAN'S GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW

Paul Selway-Swift Chairman
An effective governance framework is vital to ensuring PureCircle remains successful and sustainable. Your Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and has a vital role in setting the tone for how we do business as a Company.

BACKGROUND TO GOVERNANCE IN PURECIRCLE
At PureCircle we have ambitious long-term plans to build a large sustainable global business and "doing things properly" is a major part of our philosophy. In support of those plans, my role as Chairman, supported by my Board colleagues, is to set the tone for how we do business as a Company.
Our intention is to build a "blue chip" Company that over time is recognised as a true leader in its field and recognised as making a real sustainable contribution to help address some of the food related epidemics confronting the world today. Our intention is to build a business incorporating high standards of governance, aligned fully with principles of sustainability and good social behaviour. We see governance as supporting our intentions to remain highly competitive leaders in everything we do, particularly by promoting clear policies and systems across the business. In particular we plan to retain the nimble, fast decision making and strong innovation and development culture that has always been at the core of PureCircle and which has served us so well this far.
Within this as a Company we are prepared to accept market risk, but have no appetite for risks that might impact the health and safety of our employees or might impact our standing as a valued supplier partner to our customers. At PureCircle governance is not just confined to the boardroom. It is an integral part of the way we manage our business and control our activities every day.
Across all areas the Board should be able to contribute to key decisions and provide challenge to management in a meaningful and timely way.
One of the key principles of good Corporate Governance is that the Chief Executive should run the business while the Chairman runs the Board in a way that enables it to best discharge its duties. At PureCircle we have that principle firmly in place.
Overall I am pleased to report that your Company has complied in full with the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code with the exception of the composition of the Nomination Committee. The Board considers that the current composition is most appropriate for the Company's current requirements.
In FY17 much of the Board activity has focused on:
· Board succession planning and recruitment
· Further building our risk assessment and management processes into the day to day operations of PureCircle
· Board effectiveness

STRATEGIC REPORT

GOVERNANCE

BOARD SUCCESSION PLANNING AND RECRUITMENT
During FY2017 we consolidated our FY2016 position where we strengthened the Board considerably with a series of appointments that individually and collectively have brought relevant industry expertise, global business leadership experience as well as a wide range of specific functional skills.
Rakesh Sinha joined PureCircle in April 2016 and succeeded William Mitchell as CFO in July 2016 following his retirement from the Board.
In March 2017, Peter Lai retired from the Board as Audit Committee Chairman. John Gibney, appointed Non-Executive Director in April 2016, replaced Peter Lai as Audit Committee Chairman in March 2017.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Directors for their contribution to the Board.
As mentioned in the Nominations Committee report, John Slosar has re-joined the Board on 1 July 2017. We welcome John back since stepping down from the PureCircle Board on 18 March 2014 (first appointed on 26 Sept 2007) due to other business commitments.
RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Your Board is clear on the value and importance of assessing and managing risk in everything we do. During FY17 we have made considerable additional progress in formalising and articulating our appetite and assessment of risk and of embedding this into how we do business in PureCircle on an every-day basis.
Our Audit Committee Chairman John Gibney goes into risk in more detail in his Chairman's report following on pages 48 to 50.
PureCircle is an entrepreneurial business creating a new industry from scratch. As a Board we would like you as shareholders to be clear that we are prepared to accept industry, market and business risk because we believe that, over time the rewards that will flow from taking those risks will be substantial.
At this stage in our development this higher than average risk appetite extends across many of the business activities, whether it is leaf buying, inventory management, foreign exchange hedging, or production capacity expansion to name but a few.
However we have no appetite for any risks to the health and safety of our employees and stakeholders. Nor do we have any appetite for any risk that threatens our reputation or the long-term sustainability of our business.
BOARD'S EFFECTIVENESS
The Board reviewed the Board effectiveness based on a survey where all members participated. The Board agreed that it is of the right size with an appropriate combination of Executive and Non-Executive Directors and members have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company. The present Board and its committees operate effectively and that all Non-Executive Directors are independent.

There has been more focus on strategy and the Board sets time aside specifically focusing solely on strategy.
MEETINGS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
We stay in touch with our shareholders through face to face meetings and conference calls.
REMUNERATION
Our remuneration policy is matched to our strategy. Central to this is the creation of significant sustainable value for our shareholders.
Linked to this our Executives will only receive above average rewards for corresponding performance. Our strategic objective is to build a very large sustainable global business. We consider that the primary benchmark for assessing progress towards this goal is sustainable sales growth. Over time we also see adjusted EBITDA as becoming relevant, to ensure that profitability is taken into full account.
During FY17 we have undertaken a full review of our Remuneration programme. The detail findings of this review are covered in Chris Pratt's report as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on pages 51 to 57.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
PureCircle employs more than a thousand people in our supply chain and operations spread across four continents. The health and safety of each and all our employees is an important priority for the Company and your Board. In that context I am pleased to report that overall safety, health and environment cases improved. Despite this we have continued to put additional investment into staff training on health and safety, particularly linked to the capacity expansion at our production facilities in Malaysia and China.
DIVERSITY
PureCircle is committed to employment on a fully diverse basis. Operating across the regions that we do, at PureCircle we have diverse staffing levels in terms of nationality, language and religion, it is the source of some disappointment to the Board that to date we do not have sufficient gender diversity. Specifically gender diversification is a key requirement in the terms of reference when we search for new Directors and Senior Management. We do not have sufficient gender diversity at Board level despite considerable efforts. At senior management level, however, there is significant gender diversity in several areas.
FURTHER INFORMATION
Over the following pages we describe our corporate governance framework in more detail and we include examples of how our governance works in practice.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT

COMMITTEE MEMBERS
· Paul Selway-Swift (Chairman) · Magomet Malsagov · Christopher Pratt

BACKGROUND TO THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The function of the Nomination Committee is to provide a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board. In carrying out its duties, the Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for identifying and nominating candidates to fill Board vacancies; evaluating the structure and composition of the Board with regard to the balance of skills, board diversity, knowledge and experience and making recommendations accordingly; giving full consideration to succession planning; and reviewing the leadership of the Group. The UK Corporate Governance Code provides that a Nomination Committee should comprise a majority of members who are independent NonExecutive Directors. I chair the Nomination Committee and its other members are the Group CEO, Magomet Malsagov and Christopher Pratt. The Nomination Committee meets no less than once a year.
Appointments to the Nomination Committee are made by the Board, are made for a period of three years, which may be extended for further periods of up to three years, provided the Director whose appointment is being considered still meets the criteria for membership.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES IN FY2017 ­ APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS
In FY2017 we have appointed one Non-Executive Director and one executive Director to cover retirements.
Rakesh Sinha was appointed CFO and executive Director on 6 July 2016 replacing William Mitchell, who retired after 8-years of service.
Peter Lai Hock Meng, retired having served 9-years as Director and Audit Committee Chairman; John Gibney was appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee to replace Peter in March 2017.
Subsequent to the year end, John Slosar was appointed Independent Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2017. We welcome John back since stepping down the PC Board on 18 March 2014 (first appointed on 26 Sept 2007) due to other business commitments.
Guy Wollaert, previously not considered as independent by the Board when first appointed on 10 July 2015 (as TCCC is one of PureCircle's key customer with material business relationship with the Group and Guy was SVP And Chief Technical and Innovation Officer of TCCC before stepping down in 2015). The UK Corporate Governance Code's provision on independence requires 3 years "cooling off" period in assessing a Director's independence (provision B.1.1), however, the Board has considered Guy to be independent effective 1 July 2017 after a 2.5 years "cool-off" period due to his independence in judgement.
The Committee believes we now have a well balanced Board with an appropriate mix of skills and experience.

INTRODUCTION

STRATEGIC REPORT

For each appointment the Nomination Committee has hired external search firms operating on a global mandate specified by the Nomination Committee. Each search gave rise to initial long lists of possible candidates which was then reviewed and narrowed down to short lists, all of whom were then interviewed personally by the Nomination Committee, before appointment recommendations were made to the full Board.
I am delighted that the appointments made during FY17 will serve the Company well. Our Non-Executives all bring huge beverage industry expertise. In addition they each bring deep specific functional experience that, taken together, provides Board leadership to help challenge management across all aspects of our business from Research and Development, through Marketing, Supply Chain, Procurement, Finance and Human Resources. Plus their USA and Europe regional experience complements the already strong Board Asia heritage.
KEY CHALLENGES
The Group is committed to diversity. We are a genuinely multi- cultural multi-national business. We have eight languages spoken as a first language across our 1,100 employees; we operate in 12 different geographies and time zones. Maintaining a strong diverse culture is a core foundation of our business.
The Nomination Committee is committed to increasing the proportion of female Directors and Senior management within PureCircle. Each of the searches conducted in FY2017 had terms of reference specifically requiring the inclusion of a high number of female candidates in the search process. It is with regret that despite this we were not yet able to make appropriate female Board appointments. This remains a key priority for the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

John Gibney Chairman of the Audit Committee
Welcome to my first Audit Committee report. I am delighted to have been appointed as Audit Committee Chair of PureCircle, succeeding Peter Lai.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
· John Gibney (Chairman) · Mitch Adamek · Christopher Pratt · Peter Lai (retired March 2017)

This report sets out:
· The role, composition, activities and responsibilities of the Audit Committee;
· A summary of the meetings of the Audit Committee during the year;
· The significant issues related to the financial statements;
· The Committee's oversight of the Group's Risk Management and internal control systems; and
· The role and effectiveness of the internal audit processes.
The committee met four times during the year and invited the Company's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Head of Internal Audit to attend the meetings along with the external audit partner. As Audit Chairman, I have also held meetings with external and internal audit.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee's primary role is to assist the Board in providing effective governance over the appropriateness of the Group's financial reporting, risk management and internal control systems. It reviews the appropriateness of the financial results for the full year, half year and the interim management statements, including applicable accounting policies, key judgement areas and going concern assumptions. The Committee also reviews the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole to ensure they are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the necessary information for Shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy. The Audit committee also reviews and monitors the extent of nonaudit work undertaken by the Group's external auditors, advising on the appointment of such external auditors, overseeing the Group's relationship with its external auditors, reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit process and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's internal review and control functions.
COMMITTEE COMPOSITION
The UK Corporate Governance Code, as it applies to the Company, recommends that an audit committee should comprise at least three members who are independent Non-Executive Directors and that at least one member should have recent and relevant financial experience. The Board is satisfied that I meet this requirement, having served as Chief Financial Officer of Britvic PLC for 17 years until April 2016.
Appointments to the Audit Committee are made by the Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. Appointments to the Audit Committee are for a period of up to three years and may be extended for no more than two further periods of up to three years, provided the Director who appointment is being considered still meets the criteria for membership.
MEMBERSHIP CHANGES IN FY17
Peter Lai Hock Meng retired as Chairman of the Audit Committee in March 2017 after nine years of service as a Non-Executive Director. As Chairman of the Audit Committee I would like to express my thanks to Peter for his service and his support to me during the transition in the past year.

INTRODUCTION

STRATEGIC REPORT

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017

SPECIFIC AREAS OF FOCUS DURING THE YEAR
· The recoverability of debtors and the treatment of goods returns relating to the CBP issue. · Accounting for Intangible assets and goodwill; capitalisation of development costs; impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. · The assessment of liquidity and going concern; review of banking covenants.

Key Focus Area
Recoverability of debtors and the treatment of goods returns relating to the impoundment of shipments by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Actions during the year
The Audit Committee was informed that revenue of $14m had been recognised for shipments that were either detained or on the water bound for the US in the prior year. The length of duration of the investigation was uncertain. Ultimately, CBP clearance was received at the end of January 2017. This meant that a number of orders were subsequently cancelled by customers due to postponement/cancellation of innovation product launches. A full review of the accounting treatment of all of these orders, subsequent cash collections, returned consignments for which credit notes were issued (in excess of half of the original invoiced amounts), and returned inventory valuation, was carried out by management. This extensive exercise was reviewed by the Audit Committee which was satisfied that the appropriate accounting treatment had been applied.

Accounting for Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The Group balance sheet includes Intangible assets and goodwill. The recognition of intangible assets, the consideration of their useful lives and performing impairment assessments is inherently judgemental.

The Committee reviewed reports from management regarding the intangible assets recognised during the period and challenged the amounts capitalised and whether such amounts were in line with the Group's accounting policies. The Committee also considered management's assessment of the value in use of the intangible assets, noting that a consistent methodology was applied year on year based on a discounted cash flow model underpinned by the Group's business plan. The Committee received a report from management on carrying values, and this was discussed with the Group's auditors, alongside the work PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) performed over the annual impairment assessment for indefinite lived assets and goodwill. The Committee noted the auditor's comments on the key assumptions used on the model and the headroom above carrying value available in several downside scenarios.
Based on the above, the Committee was comfortable with the amounts recognised during the year and supported management's judgement not to record any impairment in intangible assets in the financial statements.

Liquidity and going concern. Due to the significant period of non-access to the Group's key US market, combined with capital commitments to complete the new refinery expansion, the Group's liquidity was under strain.

During the year, management conducted frequent stress test scenarios to ensure the Company's financial viability along with identifying mitigating actions to ensure the business remained a going concern for the coming 12-months. The committee reviewed the reasonableness of cash flow projections, growth projections, and the feasibility of the mitigating actions presented including the increased level of cash collections projected, to assess the ongoing financial viability of the business, and to consider any potential breach of relevant banking covenants. Management consistently delivered on the mitigating actions and as a result, adhered to all banking covenants. The Group has subsequently agreed a $200m term loan and revolving credit facility with HSBC which has now received approval by Malaysia's financial regulatory body. This will further strengthen the Group's liquidity position.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group operates a risk management process which reports to the Committee quarterly and works under the day to day supervision of the CFO.
Risks are categorised by type of risk (e.g. market, reputational, business, sustainability, etc), by their potential impact on the Group's financial position and condition and by an assessment of the likelihood of their occurrence. Proposed management plans to manage the risks are kept under review by the Committee, summarised in the Group's risk register.
The Committee receives and discusses on a quarterly basis:
· the Group's risk register, including significant emerging risks and how exposures have changed during the period; and · summary reports and progress against agreed actions from management on managing the risks identified.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

INTERNAL AUDIT
Historically, given the young nature and small size of the business, it has not been considered necessary for PureCircle to employ an internal audit function. However, as we have grown and expanded our operations internationally with increased complexity, the Company's first Head of Internal Audit, Ms. Lee-Ann Loo joined on 1st November, 2016. She joined from USG Boral, having trained as a Chartered Accountant with KPMG. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Lee-Ann's scope of work covers all our operations and whilst she reports directly to me to ensure independence, her day to day activities is managed through the Group CFO to ensure she receives ongoing support and development.
Lee-Ann's first major piece of work was to review our Leaf procurement contracts in China, which was presented to the Audit Committee in June. A full Internal Audit programme has been developed for the next 18 months, covering areas such as Procurement, Accounts Payable, Fixed Asset, Inventory Management and Payroll in the PCSB entity.
EFFECTIVENESS
Assisted by the Committee the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's systems of risk management and internal control in place throughout the year and up to the date of this report. The review considered investments made in systems and management during the year. No weaknesses or control failures significant to the Group were identified. Where areas for improvement have been identified, new procedures have been introduced to strengthen the controls and will themselves be subject to regular review as part of the ongoing assurance process.
WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY
During FY16 the Group introduced a specific policy which allows employees to report concerns in confidence and anonymously if preferred about suspected impropriety or wrongdoing. During FY17 there was no whistleblowing incidents reported. Further work is underway to introduce the availability of a hotline, in all countries.
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION POLICY
The Board has a zero-tolerance policy for bribery and corruption of any sort. The Group has rolled out a briefing and awareness programme highlighting potential areas of vulnerability. New employees are required to complete an online training module when they join.
COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS
Feedback from the annual performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees, which was conducted internally this year is described earlier on page 41 of the Annual Report. This confirmed that the Audit Committee continued to be effective in fulfilling its duties.
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) UK LLP, took over from PwC Malaysia in FY16. The Audit Committee assesses annually the qualification, expertise, resources, and independence of the auditor and the effectiveness of the audit process. The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending the appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external auditors. The Audit Committee also approves the terms of engagement and remuneration of the external auditors and monitors their independence.

AUDIT INDEPENDENCE AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
To help safeguard the auditors' objectivity and independence, the Company operates a non-audit services policy which sets out the circumstances and financial limits within which the Group auditor may be permitted to provide certain non-audit services (such as tax and other services). The Group policy is in line with Main Market best practice and is for non-audit services to be restricted to below 50% of the audit fee.
In FY17 PwC UK LLP provided non-audit services amounting to US$0.1 million. These principally relate to fees associated with briefings on developments in international tax.
The remuneration of the auditors was set at US$0.6m along with further non-audit assurance fees of US$0.1m for the review of the interim announcement.
The non-audit fees of $0.1m relating to briefings on developments in International tax amount to 6% of the Group audit fee and accordingly we are comfortable that the integrity of compliance to the independence policy has not been breached.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT
PwC reported in depth to the Committee on the scope and outcome of the annual audit. Their reports included accounting matters, governance and control, and accounting developments.
The Committee considers a number of aspects in relation to the performance of the external auditors, including the full year audit and interim review, their independence and objectivity, their remuneration and reappointment. The Audit Committee held independent meetings with the external auditors during the year and as Audit Chair, I met with PwC on a number of occasions outside of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee reviewed, discussed, challenged and agreed the approach to PwC's audit plan, including their assessment of the financial reporting risk profile of the Group. The Committee were taken through the Audit findings of PwC at both the full year audit and interim review. The Audit Committee had a full and open discussion with PwC regarding their audit work, and questioned and challenged their findings. As a result of these discussions, the Audit Committee is satisfied with the independence of the external auditor, the approach taken to the audit, the quality of the audit work and the audit findings.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
The Committee has an additional Committee meeting ahead of the formal year-end review to assess the fairness, balance, and understandability of the Group's Annual Report.
Considering the preparation process, the information provided by the management, and the opinion of the Executives and the external auditor, the Committee could confirm and recommend to the Board that the FY2017 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy.

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017

Christopher Pratt Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee Report for Fiscal Year 2017. Other members of the Committee are Paul Selway-Swift and Mitch Adamek. The Remuneration Committee met three times in FY2017.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
· Christopher Pratt (Chairman) · Paul Selway-Swift · Mitch Adamek

KEY POLICIES OF REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Fiscal Year 2017 was a challenging one for PureCircle as the Company worked to remove the Withhold Release Order imposed by the US Customs and Border Patrol (US CBP). This Order largely closed the important US market for eight months and put considerable stress on the Company's finances and staff. The hitherto consistent sales growth was interrupted which undermined the structure of the Company's reward system. It was paramount to retain key staff despite the faltering overall sales.
PureCircle is a decentralised organization with over 1,100 employees located in multiple countries around the world. It is a field-to-table Company; we source stevia from several continents, extract & refine it, and sell our finished products to food and beverage companies in all major international markets. Our work force reflects this global and operational diversity.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to set reward policies that recognise local differences but ensure that all employees, regardless of task or location, are aligned to the Company's overall strategic plan. Despite the difficult year the Remuneration Committee further refined its policies in this regard.
OVERALL PHILOSOPHY FOR REMUNERATION
Remuneration at PureCircle is driven by this key principle of alignment. Individual rewards must support overall corporate objectives such that:
· The structure of reward reflects an individual's ability to effect Company performance.
· An individual's total reward depends on Company growth, the achievement of business unit KPIs, and individual performance and effort.
For Executive and Senior management, our policy is to pay adequate base salaries and benefits, typically at or below median for the local market, and to offer an additional annual performance-based cash bonus, and a longer-term share grant scheme. If the financial performance of the Company achieves plan then remuneration over three years will be in the top quartile of comparative companies.
For middle and junior management, factory and agriculture employees, base pay and benefits are set with reference to the local market and are supplemented by an annual cash bonus that is linked to Company growth, and to both business unit and individual performance.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED

KEY ACTIVITIES IN FY2017
· Senior Leadership Team
The departure of several senior leaders from the organization in early 2016 prompted a review of the structure of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT), reporting lines and rewards. Despite the geographical challenge the SLT now meets regularly to ensure that the research, agricultural and production activities of the Company are aligned to, and supportive of, the strategic and sales goals of the Company.
Given the difficult circumstances of 2017 the Remuneration Committee approved a one-time discretionary LTIP award for each SLT member (excluding the CEO) of 100,000 shares with 50% of the award based on retention until FY2020 and 50% based on FY20 Company performance targets.
The recent decision to move certain senior executives from Kuala Lumpur to Chicago will see the award of standard expatriate benefits to those concerned.
· A Return to Growth
PureCircle has an operationally leveraged business model such that net margins increase with sales growth. Historically the Company's incentive plans were explicitly linked to sales growth. In FY16 and FY17 profit and cash targets were included in the plans. Due to the sales setback from the US CBP enquiry we have decided to place additional emphasis on incremental sales and margin growth. For FY18 onwards the Company has introduced enhanced commission levels for the Sales and Marketing teams with a new bonus programme to be derived from sales growth for Operational and Corporate employees.
The share-grant long-term incentive plan will continue to be the key retention tool for senior management but the number of executives in the plan will continue to reduce: approximately 55 recipients in FY18 down from over 100 five years ago and 73 in FY17. This progressive reduction is intended to reflect more accurately the number of managers who can really make a difference to the performance of the Company. Further details of the FY18 incentive schemes are provided later in this report.
· New 10-year LTIP plan
The Group's existing LTIP was introduced in May 2008. This plan allowed the Group to grant up to 10% of its issued share capital in the form of nil cost options to management over a ten-year period to May 2018. At the date of this report the Company has granted options that have subsequently vested equal to 4.4% of the issued share capital. The Company has recently reviewed the rules governing the LTIP and will be recommending a new ten year plan for shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.

· Salary Review
During FY17 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the two Executive Directors with reference to individual and Company performance. Accordingly the CEO base salary was increased by 3.6% and CFO base salary was increased by 4.6% effective 1 July 2016. More detail on full remuneration for Executive Directors is given in the Summary of FY17 Executive Director Remuneration Table in this report.
· FY17 Incentive Programs
Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") The Committee approved a conditional award of 1,448,778 share grants to management, subject to Revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance conditions. In March 2017, when the full impact of the US CBP WRO order became clear the Committee reduced the sales and earnings conditions of the LTIP to reflect circumstances beyond management control. However, the award still lapsed as the revised conditions were not met.
Short-Term Incentive Plan ("STIP") The STIP for FY17 was designed to reward Company, business unit, and personal performance, with more senior individuals having a higher weighting on Company versus personal achievement. In March 2017, when the impact of the US CBP WRO order became clear the Committee made downwards adjustments to the performance conditions. However the revised conditions were not met. Subsequently, for largely retention purposes, the Committee approved a discretionary STIP award of $1.0m for Management and employees, to be distributed according to personal performance. The Committee considers this appropriate in the circumstances.
Incentive programmes will necessarily change as the Company evolves and matures. The Remuneration Committee will ensure that investors and other stakeholders are kept aware fully aware of any such changes and the reasons for them.

· We have identified the following components for a full scope Audit; PureCircle Limited, PureCircle (Jiangxi) Co Ltd, PureCircle USA Inc, PureCircle (UK) Ltd, PureCircle Mexico, PureCircle (S.E.A) Sdn Bhd and PureCircle Sdn Bhd.
· The following components were subjected to the audit of specified procedures; PureCircle South America Sociedad Anonima, PureCircle Kenya Limited and PureCircle China Agricultural Development Co Ltd, PureCircle Trading Sdn Bhd, PureCircle (Shanghai) Co Ltd.
· Taken together, the locations and functions where we performed our audit work accounted for 100% of revenue and approximately 98% of absolute profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the numerical values without regard to whether they were profits or losses for the relevant locations and functions).
· Financing (Group and parent). · Accounting for Intangible Assets and Goodwill (Group).

The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Financing

Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), pages 93 and 94 (note 21 ­ Borrowings) and page 100 (note 30 ­ Events after the reporting period).
As at 30 June 2017, the Group had $117.7 million of short-term and long-term borrowings. Two of these debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenant clauses which, in case of breach, results in creditors obtaining the right to claim early repayment.
In September, the Group agreed a new $200 million syndicated loan facility with HSBC to replace and consolidate existing loan facilities. The new facility also contains financial and non-financial covenants.
Management's assessment of compliance with existing debt covenants did not identify any breaches during the year ending 30 June 2017.
Management's assessment to support the use of the Going Concern basis of accounting also included consideration of whether the Group is forecast to be in compliance with the loan covenants attached to the new HSBC facility for the next 12 months. No breaches were identified by management in their forecast.

We obtained and reviewed every debt agreement to understand its terms and conditions and agreed the inputs to the model, including maturity dates, the level of facilities available to the Group and loan covenant definitions including the new HSBC facility. There were no exceptions noted from our testing.
In order to test the model, we challenged and evaluated the future cash flow forecasts for the Group and the process by which they were drawn up and tested the accuracy of the underlying calculations.
We found that management has followed a clear process for drawing up the future cash flow forecasts, which was subject to oversight and challenge by the Directors and which was consistent with Board approved budgets, which reflect current market conditions.
As part of our testing we challenged the key assumptions as follows:
· the revenue and profit assumptions by comparing them to historical results and the current order book;
· the appropriateness of assumptions made regarding the collection period for accounts receivable by comparing to the Group's current debtor days and track record;

· the appropriateness of key inputs in the model such as leaf prices and forecast purchase volumes by comparing to current prices for leaf, production forecast and sales pipeline data; and

· the appropriateness of potential mitigating activities included in management's assessments, including deferring purchases and liquidating inventory, to identify if these mitigating activities were fully within the control of management and realistic through comparing to track record and current market prices for inventory on hand.

We found the above assumptions to be consistent and in line with our expectations.

We re-performed management's calculations and satisfied ourselves that no breaches of debt covenants had occurred as at 30 June 2017 or were forecast to occur for the next 12 months.

generating unit (`CGU') and future market performance. In particular, there is uncertainty in the stevia market due to the increasing number of products and applications being developed and accepted by customers. As such, the key judgemental areas are the short-term revenue and margin growth rates, terminal growth rates and the discount rate.

In order to test the impairment assessment model, we challenged and evaluated the future cash flow forecasts for the identified CGU and the process by which they were drawn up and tested the accuracy of the underlying calculations.
We found that management has followed a clear process for drawing

up the future cash flow forecasts, which was subject to oversight and

challenge by the Directors and which was consistent with Board approved

budgets, which reflect current market conditions.

As part of our testing we challenged the key assumptions as follows:

· The short-term revenue and profit assumptions and how management has incorporated the impact of the recent market changes, by comparing them to historical results and the current order book, agreeing the short-term growth rate to specialist third party published reports and considering the impact already observed within the market;

· Terminal growth rates in the forecasts by comparing them to historical results, economic and industry forecasts; and

· The discount rates by assessing the cost of capital assumption for comparable organisations.

We found the above assumptions to be consistent and in line with our expectations.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of entities covering non-trading legal entities, centralised functions, two processing facilities, regional sales offices and research and development facilities.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we considered the type of work that needed to be performed at the operating units by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the extent of audit work needed at those operating units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The Group's operating units vary significantly in size and we identified 7 operating units that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, due to their size or risk characteristics. Specific audit procedures over certain balances and transactions were performed at a further 5 operating units, to give appropriate coverage of all material balances at the Group level. In doing so we conducted work in 6 countries and, in addition to our work at the centralised function in Malaysia, the Group audit team visited reporting locations in Malaysia and China. Further, specific audit procedures over central functions and areas of significant judgement, including taxation, treasury and impairment, were performed by the Group audit team centrally. Together, the operating units subject to audit procedures and centralised testing accounted for 100% of Group revenues and 98% of absolute Group profit before tax.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

62

INTRODUCTION

STRATEGIC REPORT

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Overall materiality How we determined it
Rationale for benchmark applied

Group financial statements
$1,189,000 (2016: $1,384,000).
1% of Revenue.
PureCircle Limited is a fast-growing Company. Revenue is a key indicator for the Group, and for users of the accounts, and we therefore consider this to be the most appropriate benchmark.

Company financial statements $1,919,900 (2016: $2,006,550). 1% of total assets. The Company is an investment holding Company with no trading/manufacturing activities.

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between $100,000 and $1,105,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $118,000 (Group audit) (2016: $138,000) and $191,900 (Company audit) (2016: $200,650) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:

Reporting obligation

Outcome

We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of the Directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the Directors' identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.

We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

We are required to report if the Directors' statement relating to Going Concern equivalent to that required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.

We have nothing to report.

Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT CONTINUED

The Directors' assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: · The Directors' confirmation on pages 28 and 29 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. · The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. · The Directors' explanation on pages 28 and 29 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors' statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group (required under the Listing Rules) and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors' process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the "Code"); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. Other Code Provisions We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: · The statement given by the Directors, on page 50, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and Company's position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the course of performing our audit. · The section of the Annual Report on page 50 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. · The Directors' statement relating to the Company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 59, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with Section 90 of the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda) and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the financial year ended 30 June 2017

1 GENERAL INFORMATION
The Company was incorporated and registered as a private limited Company in Bermuda, under the Companies (Bermuda) Law 1981. The registered office and principal place of business are as follows:

Registered office: Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda.

Principal place of business: Level 12, West Wing, Rohas PureCircle No. 9, Jalan P. Ramlee 50250 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

The Group has, at the date of these financial statements, sufficient existing financing available for its estimated requirements for at least the next 12 months. After reviewing the Group's annual budget, plans and the new $200m financing facility arranged with HSBC in September 2017, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating and that it is therefore appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial information. The HSBC facility constitutes a $100m term loan and a $100m revolving credit facility (`RCF'). The loan replaces our existing five facilities which are with four banks. The term loan refinances existing loans, with four years to maturity. The RCF has a tenure of three years and provides additional headroom for working capital to fund growth.

The Company's shares are publicly traded on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
In the financial statements, "Company" refers to PureCircle Ltd. and "Group" refers to PureCircle Ltd and its subsidiaries.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with a resolution of the Directors dated 18 September 2017.

(a) The new accounting standards, amendments and improvements to published standards and interpretations that are effective for the Group and Company's financial year beginning on or after 1 July 2016 are as follows:
· Amendments to IFRS 11 "Joint Arrangements" Accounting for acquisition of interests in joint operations
· Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 "Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation"

2 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES

· Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 "Investment Entities"

The Company is engaged principally in the business of investment holding whilst the principal activities of the rest of the Group are the production, marketing and distribution of natural ingredient including sweeteners and flavours.
There have been no significant changes in the nature of these activities during the financial year. The principal activities of the subsidiaries and joint venture are set out in Consolidated level Note 7 and Company level Note 3 to the financial statements.

· Amendment to IAS 1 "Presentation of Financial Statements ­ Disclosure Initiative"
· Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 ­ 2014 cycle
The adoption of these standards did not have any material effect on the financial performance or position of the Group and the Company.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations that have been issued and are applicable to the Group but are not yet effective:

3 BASIS OF PREPARATION

The Group will apply the new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations in the following period:

The Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and IFRS Interpretations Committee ("IFRS IC") Interpretations. The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 6.

· IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" - An entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of goods or services, i.e. when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services.
Transfer of control is not the same as transfer of risks and rewards as currently considered for revenue recognition. A Company would recognise revenue when (or as) it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when the customer obtains control of that good or service). A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time (typically for promises to transfer goods to a customer) or over time (typically for promises to transfer services to a customer).

INTRODUCTION

STRATEGIC REPORT

· IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" will replace IAS 39 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement". IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model in IAS 39 and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income ("OCI"). The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are always measured at fair value through profit or loss with a irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI (provided the instrument is not held for trading). A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest.
For liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. These include amortised cost accounting for most financial liabilities, with bifurcation of embedded derivatives. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity's own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The Group is currently assessing the impact to its financial statements.

4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity and cash flow risk, and capital risk management. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance.
(a) Financial risk management policies (i) Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk when the Company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currencies. Foreign exchange risk arises from commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Group manages its foreign exchange exposure by taking advantage of any natural offsets of the Group's foreign exchange revenue and expenses and from time to time enters into foreign exchange forward contracts for a portion of the remaining exposure relating to these forecast transactions when deemed appropriate.

(ii) Financial year beginning on 1 July 2019
· IFRS 16 "Leases" supersedes IAS 17 "Leases" and the related interpretations.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in foreign currencies exchange rates, with all other variables held constant of the Group's result:

Under IFRS 16, a lease is a contract (or part of a contract) that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases by the lessee as either finance leases (on balance sheet) or operating leases (off balance sheet). IFRS 16 requires a lessee to recognise a "right-of-use" of the underlying asset and a lease liability reflecting future lease payments for most leases.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated in accordance with the principle in IAS 16 "Property, Plant and Equipment" and the lease liability is accreted over time with interest expense recognised in the income statement.
For lessors, IFRS 16 retains most of the requirements in IAS 17. Lessors continue to classify all leases as either operating leases or finance leases and account for them differently.
The Group is currently assessing the impact to its financial statements.

(ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of the Group's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from interest-bearing borrowings at floating rates. The Group's interest rate profile is set out below:

Term loans

2017
Effective interest rate
(%)
4.67

2016
Effective interest rate
(%)
4.30

2017
USD'000 117,735

2016
USD'000 113,929

Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. The Group actively reviews its debt portfolio to mitigate the impact of interest risk. The Group does not utilise interest swap contracts or other derivative instruments for trading or speculation purposes.
As at balance sheet date, if interest rates on borrowings are 1% higher/lower for a year with all other variables held constant post-tax profit for the financial year would be USD1,177,000 lower/higher (2016: post-tax profit for the financial year would be USD1,140,000 higher/lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowing.

(iii) Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, the payment profile of the customers and credit exposure are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debt is not significant. The Group also establishes an allowance account for impairment that represents its estimate of losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The Group's maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements.
At 30 June 2017, 2 customers (2016: 2) comprised more than 30% of total receivables and 13 customers (2016: 7) comprised 75% of total receivables. See Note 13 for ageing of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired.
The Group's and the Company's cash and cash equivalents are placed with creditworthy financial institutions and the risks arising thereof are minimised in view of the financial strength of these financial institutions.
(iv) Liquidity and cash flow risks
Liquidity and cash flow risks arise mainly from general funding and business activities. The Group's cash flow is reviewed regularly to ensure commitments are settled when they fall due.
Cash flow forecasting is performed both in the operating entities and on a Group consolidated basis. The Group monitors rolling forecasts of its liquidity requirements including projected sales revenues, inventory and capital expenditure requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or financial covenants on any of its borrowing facilities. The Group invest surplus cash into financial interest bearing accounts and money market deposits.
The following tables detail the remaining contractual maturities at the reporting date of the Group's non-derivative financial liabilities, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows (including interest payments computed using contractual rates or, if floating, based on rates current at the reporting date) and the earliest date the Group can be required to pay:

4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
(b) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debts, which include the borrowings disclosed in Note 16, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base by having low to moderate gearing. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity.
The gearing ratio at the financial year end was as follows:

Borrowings (i) Less: Gross cash (ii) Net borrowings (iii) Equity (iv) Net borrowings to equity ratio

(iii)Net borrowings are calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings are in the consolidated statement of financial
position less gross cash. (iv) Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to the equity holders of the Company.
(c) Fair value estimation
Fair value is defined as the amount at which the assets/liabilities could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction, other than in a forced sale or liquidation.
The fair value measurement hierarchy for assets/liabilities stated in the balance sheet is as follows:
· Level 1: Quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. · Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or
indirectly (that is, derived from prices). · Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
There are no significant fair value estimates at level 2 or 3 made for the financial instruments measured at fair value for the Group as at the reporting date.

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017
5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the financial years presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a) Financial assets ­ loans and receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for impairment. An allowance for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
(b) Financial liabilities (i) Payables
Liabilities for trade and other payables and accruals, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(ii) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction cost incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction cost) and the redemption value is recognised in the profit or loss over the period of the loans and borrowings using the effective interest method.
(c) Foreign currency translation (i) Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency of each of the Group's entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entities operate. The functional and presentation currency of the Company is United States Dollar ("USD"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States Dollar ("USD") which is the Company's presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions of the Group's entities in foreign currency are converted into USD at the approximate rates of exchange ruling at the transaction dates. Transactions in foreign currency are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are translated at the rates ruling as of that date. Exchange differences arising from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates that existed when the values were determined.
(iii) Foreign operations
The results and financial position of the subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency as follows: (a)assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations, for each statement of financial
position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date; and (b) income and expenses for each profit or loss are translated at the average exchange rates for the financial year; and (c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity; and (d) on disposal, accumulated translation differences are recognised in the profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale of the foreign operation.

for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 (continued)
5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiaries exceeds the cost of the business combinations, the excess is recognised immediately in the profit or loss.
Inter-Company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(ii) Transactions with non-controlling interests
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
(iii) Disposal of subsidiaries
When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(iv) Joint ventures
The Group's interest in a joint venture is accounted for in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group's share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the joint ventures), the Group recognise the further losses to the extent of its incurred obligations.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(e) Goodwill on consolidation
Goodwill that arises upon acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Impairment losses on goodwill are recognised immediately in the profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent year. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or Groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose identified according to operating segment.
Acquisition of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transaction.
76

INTRODUCTION

STRATEGIC REPORT

GOVERNANCE

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017
(f) Investments in joint ventures
Investments in joint ventures are stated at cost in the statement of financial position of the Company, and are reviewed for impairment at the end of the financial year if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. On the disposal of the investments in joint ventures, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investments is taken to the profit or loss.
(g) Intangible assets (other than goodwill)
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair values as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
(i) Intellectual property
The intellectual property consists of the internal investment and external acquisition costs of the patents, trademarks, technological processes and all intellectual and industrial property rights ("intellectual property rights") in connection therewith on the production of natural sweeteners, pharmaceutical products and chemical derivatives of bio-organic and physiologically active compounds. The acquisition cost is capitalised as an intangible asset as it is able to generate future economic benefits to the Group. The useful life of these intellectual property rights, other than patented development costs is considered to be indefinite based on the Directors' annual reassessment of the useful life; there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. Intellectual property rights are stated at cost less impairment losses. They are not amortised but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment are identified. The intellectual property rights are assessed to have an indefinite useful life because the Group's natural sweeteners and flavours are expected to become mass volume ingredients in all foods and beverage categories. Similar to the sugar market, there is no expected end to the useful life of the natural sweeteners and flavours such as stevia. Accordingly, the Directors believe the useful life for intellectual property rights is indefinite. The Directors will continue to reassess the basis of that useful life of the intellectual property rights on an annual basis. Patented development costs are subject to estimated useful life of no more than 20 years and amortised starting from the financial year when the product is first viable for commercial use.
(ii) Development costs
All research costs are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred. Development costs consist of expenditure incurred on product development and leaf development projects. Expenditure incurred on these projects are capitalised as intangible assets only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible assets so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resource to complete the project and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the developments. Expenditures which do not meet these criteria are recognised in the profit or loss when incurred. Product development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of no more than 20 years starting from the financial year when the product are first viable for commercial use. Leaf development costs are only amortised when stevia plant demonstrates capability of producing high yielding strains of stevia leaf at reasonable consistency on a volume production basis. As at 30 June 2017, these development projects remain on-going as the development targets have not been fully met and no amortisation has been charged.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 (continued)

5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(h) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any, and is not depreciated. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is calculated under the straight-line method to write off the depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation of an asset does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

Buildings2% ­ 5%

Extraction and refinery plant 

2% ­ 20%

Office equipment, furniture and fittings and motor vehicles

20%

The depreciation method, useful life and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition of the asset is included in the profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

Capital work-in-progress represents assets under construction, and which are not ready for commercial use at the reporting date. Capital workin-progress is stated at cost, and will be transferred to the relevant category of long-term assets and depreciated accordingly when the assets are completed and ready for commercial use.

(i) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

(j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Cost of raw materials is determined based on the weighted average basis, and comprises the purchase price and incidentals incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress includes the cost of materials, labour and production overheads.

Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Where necessary, due allowance is made for all damaged, obsolete and slow-moving items.

(k) Income taxes
Income taxes for the year comprise current and deferred tax.

Current tax is the expected amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year and is measured using the applicable tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on the temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than those that arise from goodwill or excess of the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the business combination costs or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.

78

INTRODUCTION

STRATEGIC REPORT

GOVERNANCE

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applicable in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is recognised in the profit or loss, except when it arises from a transaction which is recognised directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity, or when it arises from a business combination that is an acquisition, in which case the deferred tax is included in the resulting goodwill or excess of the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the business combination costs. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilised.
(l) Equity instruments
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as liabilities when approved for appropriation.
(m) Restricted cash
Restricted cash comprise cash balances held in an account solely for the purpose of utilising trade finance facility and credit card facility provided by a licensed financial institution.
(n) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, short-term deposits with licensed banks with maturities of three month or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents exclude restricted cash.
(o) Employee benefits (i) Short-term benefits
Wages, salaries, paid annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
(ii) Defined contribution plans
The Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further liability in respect of the defined contribution plans. The Group has no defined benefit plan.
(p) Share-based payment
The Group operates a long-term incentive programme which is an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share awards) of the Company. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share awards is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions and the number of shares expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards that are expected to become exercisable. When the share awards are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the share awards are exercised.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of past event, the Group has a present legal and constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.

5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(r) Leases
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownerships are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included as borrowings. The interest element of the finance charge is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Plant and equipment acquired under a finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
The prepaid land lease payments represent the Group's right to use the land for 20 years. Accordingly, the amortisation of the prepaid land lease payments is on a straight line basis over 20 years.
(s) Segmental information
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO")). The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
(t) Revenue recognition (i) Sale of goods
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of sales taxes, returns and trade discounts. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity.
In practice, this means that sales of stevia products are recognised once the contractual terms, typically Free On Board or Ex-Works, have been met and the stevia product has been delivered to a specified location (usually the carrier of the port of departure) or leaves the refinery.
(ii) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis, based on the effective yield on the investment.
(u) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
(v) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
(w) Borrowings costs
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017
6 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated by the Directors and management and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and judgements that affect the application of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures, and have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are discussed below.
(i) Goodwill and other assets carrying values (a) Key assumptions for value-in-use calculations
The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit ("CGU") is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period including a terminal value as required by IAS 36 "Impairment of Assets". The key assumptions used in the CGU's value-in-use computation are: (i) Growth rate The average sales growth rate used is based on planned capacity and forecasted demands. The short to medium-term growth rates used are not more than 31% per annum (2016: 25%). The long-term growth rate used is 2% (2016: 2%) per annum, based on sweetener industry's long-term growth rate ranging from 2% to 4% (2016: 2% to 4%) per annum. (ii) Gross margin Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market. (iii) Discount rate The discount rate used is 10% per annum.
(b) Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The Directors believes that a reasonable change in any of the above key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of the intangible assets to be impaired.
(ii) Indefinite useful life of intellectual property rights
The intellectual property rights are assessed to have indefinite useful lives because over the long-term , the Group's natural sweeteners and flavours are expected to become mass volume ingredients in all foods and beverage categories. Similar to the sugar market, there is no expected end to the useful life of the natural sweeteners and flavours such as stevia. Accordingly, the Directors believe the useful life for intellectual property rights is indefinite. The Directors will continue to reassess the basis of the useful life of the intellectual property rights on an annual basis.
(iii) Useful life of product development costs
The product development cost is amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of no more than 20 years starting from the financial year when the product are first viable which consistent with useful life of intellectual property.

Intellectual property rights comprise the patents, trade mark technology process and all intellectual and industrial property rights in connection therewith on the production of natural sweetener related products and derivatives of bio-organic and physiologically active compounds.
As at 30 June 2017, the carrying value of indefinite life intangible assets is USD10,434,329 (2016: USD10,613,032). The change in value was due to foreign currency translation differences.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group's single CGU identified according to its only operating segment. See Note 6(i) for key assumptions used in the valuein-use calculations.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carry-forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future tax profit is probable based on projections and forecasts prepared by management and taking into consideration the expiry dates of carry forward losses. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of USD2,089,718 (2016: USD74,000) in respect of losses amounting to USD13,249,620 (2016: USD598,000) that can be carried forward against future taxable income.

The Group's normal trade credit terms range from 30 to 60 days (2016: 30 to 60 days). Terms for joint venture are 30 to 45 days (2016: 30 to 45 days) after consumption or onward sales of products. Other credit terms are assessed on a case-by-case basis and are determined by reference to past default exposure.
In line with all businesses, management reviews the credit terms and collectability of all balances on an on-going basis and exercises judgement in assessing the recoverability of amounts due.
As of 30 June 2017, trade receivables amounting to USD6,081,000 (2016: USD5,776,000) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default. The ageing of the trade receivables that are past due but not impaired is as follows:

The Company maintains a Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), the principal terms include a restriction on the Company issuing (or granting rights to issue) no more than 10% of its issued ordinary share capital under the LTIP (and any other employee share plan) in any ten calendar year period. It is currently intended that, other than in exceptional circumstances, such as senior executive recruitment, all awards will be subject to performance conditions and that, the performance conditions will be linked principally to the Group's sales growth. The awards are conditional on employment service requirements.
The LTIP recognises the fast growth and changing nature of the Company and the need to recruit and retain executives in different employment markets around the world. Accordingly, the LTIP allows for the Remuneration Committee to exercise significant discretion in exceptional cases where the Committee considers executives will bring particular value to shareholders.
The fair value of share awards granted is estimated at the date of the grant, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIPs were granted.

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (`FRS 101') as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The Company has transitioned for all periods presented.
This transition is not considered to have had an effect on the financial statements. FRS 101 requires the financial statements to be prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), whilst allowing for a number of reduced disclosure exemptions as highlighted below.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 2.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101:
­Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, "Share-based payment" (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined).
­ IFRS 7, "Financial Instruments: Disclosures". ­Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, "Fair value measurement" (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of
assets and liabilities). ­ Paragraph 38 of IAS 1, "Presentation of financial statements" comparative information requirements in respect of:
(i) paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1"Presentation of Financial Statements"; (ii) paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 "Property, Plant and Equipment"; and (iii) paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38 "Intangible Assets" (reconciliations between the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period).
­ Paragraph 134­136 (capital management disclosures) of IAS 1, "Presentation of Financial Statements". ­Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors" (requirement for the disclosure of information
when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective). ­ Paragraph 17 of IAS 24, "Related Party Disclosures" (key management compensation). ­The requirements in IAS 24, "Related Party Disclosures" to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more wholly owned
members of a Group.
After reviewing the Company's annual budget, plans and financing arrangements for at least the next 12 months, the Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue operating and that it is therefore appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 (continued)
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(a) Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is United States Dollar ("USD"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States Dollar ("USD") which is the Company's presentation currency.
(b) Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost in the statement of financial position of the Company, and are reviewed for impairment at the end of the financial year if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
On the disposal of the investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investments is taken to the profit or loss.
(c) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair values as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
(d) Intellectual property
The intellectual property consists of the internal investment and external acquisition costs of the patents, trademarks, technological processes and all intellectual and industrial property rights ("intellectual property rights") in connection therewith on the production of natural sweeteners, pharmaceutical products and chemical derivatives of bio-organic and physiologically active compounds. The acquisition cost is capitalised as an intangible asset as it is able to generate future economic benefits to the Company.
The useful life of these intellectual property rights, other than patented development costs is considered to be indefinite based on the Directors' annual reassessment of the useful life; there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Company. Intellectual property rights are stated at cost less impairment losses. They are not amortised but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment are identified. The intellectual property rights are assessed to have an indefinite useful life because the Company's natural sweeteners and flavours are expected to become mass volume ingredients in all foods and beverage categories. Similar to the sugar market, there is no expected end to the useful life of the natural sweeteners and flavours such as stevia. Accordingly, the Directors believe the useful life for intellectual property rights is indefinite. The Directors will continue to reassess the basis of that useful life of the intellectual property rights on an annual basis.
Patented development costs are subject to estimated useful life of no more than 20 years and amortised starting from the financial year when the product is first viable for commercial use.
(e) Development costs
All research costs are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Development costs consist of expenditure incurred on product development and leaf development projects.
Expenditure incurred on these projects are capitalised as intangible assets only when the Company can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible assets so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resource to complete the project and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the developments. Expenditures which do not meet these criteria are recognised in the profit or loss when incurred.
Product development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of no more than 20 years starting from the financial year when the product are first viable for commercial use.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

INTRODUCTION

STRATEGIC REPORT

PureCircle Limited Annual Report 2017

Depreciation is calculated under the straight-line method to write off the depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation of an asset does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

Office equipment, furniture and fittings and motor vehicles

20%

The depreciation method, useful life and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition of the asset is included in the profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

Capital work-in-progress represents assets under construction, and which are not ready for commercial use at the reporting date. Capital workin-progress is stated at cost, and will be transferred to the relevant category of long-term assets and depreciated accordingly when the assets are completed and ready for commercial use.

(g) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

(h) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, short-term deposits with licensed banks with maturities of three month or less, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents exclude restricted cash.

(i) Employee benefits (i) Short-term benefits
Wages, salaries, paid annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Company.

(ii) Defined contribution plans
The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further liability in respect of the defined contribution plans. The Group has no defined benefit plan.

(j) Share-based payment
The Company operates a long-term incentive programme which is an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share awards) of the Company. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share awards is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions and the number of shares expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards that are expected to become exercisable.

When the share awards are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the share awards are exercised.

The grant by the Company of share awards over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution in the subsidiary. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.

(k) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of past event, the Company has a present legal and constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.

2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated by the Directors and management and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and judgements that affect the application of the Company's accounting policies and disclosures, and have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are discussed below.
(i) Indefinite useful life of intellectual property rights
The intellectual property rights are assessed to have indefinite useful lives because over the long-term , the Company natural sweeteners and flavours are expected to become mass volume ingredients in all foods and beverage categories. Similar to the sugar market, there is no expected end to the useful life of the natural sweeteners and flavours such as stevia. Accordingly, the Directors believe the useful life for intellectual property rights is indefinite. The Directors will continue to reassess the basis of that useful life of the intellectual property rights on an annual basis.
