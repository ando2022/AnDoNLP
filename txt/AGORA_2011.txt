Dear shareholders,
Please find attached the 2011 Annual Report of the Agora Group. This period was characterized by a slight growth of advertising market, further structural changes taking place in media, progressing fragmentation of media offers as well as an intense battle for advertising budgets which contributed to the discount pressure on the market.
None the less, even in such difficult circumstances the Agora Group generated higher revenues, inter alia, due to the consolidation of the cinema business in the Group's results since September 2010 and persistent development of the Group's other businesses. Additionally, due to the purchase of majority stake in the third largest cinema operator in Poland, the Group increased its presence in the entertainment segment of the market and accelerated the process of diversification of the revenue sources diminishing its reliance on advertising revenues.
Year 2011 was a difficult one for the whole press market as well as for Agora's publishing activities. Therefore, we are glad that quality of the content and successful editorial strategies offered by Gazeta Wyborcza allowed the newspaper to preserve the title of the most popular opinion making newspaper in Poland. We constantly increase the access to the content offered by Gazeta Wyborcza by means of dedicated applications on smart phones and tablets. Thanks to interesting sales and marketing initiatives Gazeta Wyborcza preserved the highest share in dailies advertising expenditure. Metro ­ our free newspaper improved its operating results and increased its share in dailies advertising expenditure and preserved the title of the third most daily read newspaper in Poland. The global trend of copy sales decrease and erosion of advertising budgets did not spare Agora's Magazine segment which due to an impairment loss on selected titles noted a decrease in operating results. Due to the well assorted sales offer and good quality content our titles were popular among readers and advertisers. Additionally, all the content created for our paper titles enriches the Group's web services.
Despite lower revenues in 2011 our Special Projects operations improved its operating result (EBIT) The success of this business is dependent upon the selection of the type and number of projects in a given period and their popularity among recipients.
Our radio stations slightly strengthened their market position, mainly due to the results achieved in the first three quarters of 2011. Our advertising radio offer proved attractive and contributed to the growth of the segment's revenue. We continued development of Internet radio platform and mobile applications to increase reach of our radio brands and create new sources of income.
AMS strengthened its share in outdoor advertising expenditure and grew its revenue. Increased revenue and cost control policy contributed to the improved operating results of the segment. Outdoor advertising is a significant component of our operations and we believe that with the growth of the advertising market it will help to strengthen financial and market position of the Agora Group.
Internet becomes more and more important medium in the portfolio of the Agora Group. The services comprising Gazeta.pl group are among three most popular portals in Poland. Due to the growth of revenue and cost control policy we managed to improve the operating results of the Internet operations. We are dedicated to the development of our Internet offer and in 2011 we enriched it with the projects created organically (f.ex. Kinoplex) and acquired outside the Company (f.ex. Futbolow.pl and GoldenLine.pl).
Year 2011 was the first full year of consolidation the cinema business in the Agora Group. During this time, the segment grew its revenues and improved operating results contributing to the growth of revenues in the Agora Group. The Cinema segment is currently one of the largest businesses in the Agora Group and it allows the Group to diversify its revenue sources and decrease its reliance on advertising revenue. Due to that, we intend to further develop our cinema business by opening new cinemas.
According to our estimates the advertising market in Poland in 2012 shall grow by 0 ­ 3%. Media segments should participate in this growth in a different degree. We think that press shall be the only medium in which we will not observe the growth of advertising expenditure in 2012. The main reason for that are changes in the media consumption patterns, which seem to permanently change the structure of media market. Whereas, press is still a substantial component of the Agora Group activities achieving high profitability.
We are aware of all challenges emerging from both, market and civilization changes. Our objective is to match the Group's activities to changing conditions not forgetting about the Group's growth which is our priority.
We would like to thank all our shareholders for their interest,
Piotr Niemczycki

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2011 and for the year ended thereon

(g)Information about the financial statements
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on 13 April 2012.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aplicable to financial reporting, adopted by the European Union.
As at the day of publication of these consolidated financial statements, taking into account the adaptation process of IFRS by the European Union, there are no differences between IFRS and IFRS adopted by the European Union with respect to the financial reporting of the Group.
(b)Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in PLN thousands. Polish zloty is functional currency of parent company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint-ventures (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine, which functional currency is hryvnia - UAH). All amounts (unless otherwise indicated) are recalculated and rounded to nearest thousand. The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared with the assumption that the Company and its subsidiaries would continue their business activities in the foreseeable future. There are no threats that would prevent the companies from continuing their business operations.
The accounting policies were applied consistently by Group entities.
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has followed the same accounting policies as used in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2010, except for the changes connected with IFRSs described below.
For the Group's financial statements for the year started with January 1, 2011, new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which were endorsed by the European Union, are effecitve:
1) Amendments to IFRS 1 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters, 2) Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, 3) Amendments to IAS 32 Presentation - Classification of Rights Issues, 4) Amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding, 5) IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments, 6) Improvements to IFRS 2010.
The revised standards or new interpretations have not had any significant impact on the previously presented consolidated financial statements.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by Agora S.A. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Changes in a parent`s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounter for as equity transactions.
(ii) Associates
An associate is that entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. The investments in associates are accounted using the equity method. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 12

AGORA GROUP

Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2011 and for the year ended thereon

(all amounts in PLN thousands unless otherwise indicated)

translation only

carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.
(iii) Joint-ventures
Joint-venture is an entity which is joinlty controlled by the dominant party or major investees and other shareholders or cooperators on the basis of the statute, company's act or the agreement signed for the period longer than one year. The investments in joint ventures are accounted using the equity method. An interest in a jointly controlled entity is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquistion change in the venturer's share of net assets of the jointly controlled entity. The profit or loss of the venturer includes the venturer's share of the profit or loss of the jointly controlled entity.
(iv)Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates and joint-ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
(v) Put options granted to non-controlling interests
When an agreement signed by the Group with non-controlling shareholders grants a conditional put option for the shares, which they possess and the put option granted meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and at the same time, the non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares, the Group recognises the financial liability in the consolidated balance sheet (line item: other financial liabilities) equl to the estimated, discounted redemption amount of the put option and decreases other reserves (line item in the consolidated balance sheet : Retained earnings and other reserves). Subsequent changes in the value of the liability are recognised through the income statement.

(d) Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or cost incurred for their manufacture, development or modernization, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy from point x).

The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises costs incurred in their purchase or development and modernisation and includes capitalised borrowing costs.

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, by significant class of asset, is as follows:

Perpetual leasehold of land Buildings Plant and machinery Motor vehicles Other equipment

86 - 93 years 10 - 40 years 2 - 20 years 5 - 8 years 3 - 10 years

Land is not depreciated.
Repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement when the expenditure is incurred; in other cases are capitalised.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
(e) Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w). Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment.

In respect of associates and joint-ventures accounted for the equity method, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate and the joint-venture.
Other intangible assets, except for the acquired magazine titles, that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any (see accounting policy w).
Other intangibles are depreciated using the straight line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Estimated useful lives of other intangible (except for the acquired magazine titles) assets are between 3 and 10 years.
Acquired magazine titles have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised. Their market position and lack of legal and market barriers for their publishing determined such qualification. Instead they are tested annually for impairment or more often if there are indications of impairment (see accounting policy w).
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and demand deposits.
(g) Derivative financial instruments
Upon signing an agreement that includes derivative financial instruments embedded, the Group assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and whether the agreement that embodies the embedded derivative instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. Derivatives embedded in foreign currency non-financial instrument contracts are not separated from the host contracts if these contracts are in currencies which are commonly used in the economic environment in which transactions take place. If the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be closely related to the host contract and the embedded derivative instrument would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative instrument is separated from the host contract and valued at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially and subsequently measured at fair value. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and any gain or loss relating to the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in the income statement.
(h) Loans
Loans originated by the Group are financial assets created by the Group providing money, goods, or services to a debtor, other than those created with the intent to be sold in the short-term. Loans originated by the Group comprise loans provided to associate entities, other non-consolidated entities and loans originating on the buy-sell back treasury bonds transactions. Originated loans are carried at amortized cost, less impairment losses recognised (see accounting policy w). Accrued interest is included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises. When the loans become impaired the Group recognises impairment losses for all interest accrued on those loans.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that the Group principally holds for the purpose of short- term profit taking. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Financial gains or losses on financial assets are recognised in net profit or loss for the period.
(j) Availableforsale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition (at which date available-for-sale financial assets are stated at cost), all available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in equity. For interest-bearing financial assets interest is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement.

(k) Derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets are derecognised, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or the Group has transferred the contractual rights to the cash flows to a third party and simultaneously transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
The financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.

(l) Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency for Agora S.A., its subsidiaries and associates is Polish zloty (excluding LLC Agora Ukraine ­ which functional currency is hryvnia). Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions using:
 the purchase or selling rate of the bank whose services are used by the Group entity ­ in case of foreign currency sales or purchase transactions, as well as of the debt or liability payment transactions,
 the average rate specified for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland as on the preceding date before that date ­ in case of other transactions.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised as financial income or expense in the consolidated income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to PLN at the foreign exchange rate set by the National Bank of Poland ruling for that date.
(m) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses. The Group recognises impairment losses for receivables in dispute and doubtful debts. The losses are charged to other operating or financial costs depending on the nature of the amount that was provided for.
(n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less VAT, discounts and the costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cost is determined by specific identification of their individual costs for paints and paper and by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for other materials, goods for resale and finished goods.
(o) Equity
(i)Share capital
The share capital of the parent company is also the share capital of the Group and is presented at the nominal value of registered stock, in accordance with the parent company's statute and commercial registration.
(ii)Treasury shares purchased for their redemption.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(iii)Share premium
The share premium is a capital reserve arising on the Group's initial public offering ("IPO") during 1999 and is presented net of the IPO costs, decreased by the tax shield on the costs.
(iv)Retained earnings and other reserves
Retained earnings represent accumulated net profits / losses. Other reserves include also the equivalent of costs of share-based payments recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 and the recognition of the put option given to the non- controlling shareholders.

(p) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is calculated according to tax regulations.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the balance sheet liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, and for tax losses carried forward, except for:
(i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and
(ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates to the extent the parent is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The principal temporary differences arise on depreciation of property, plant and equipment and various transactions not considered to be taxable or tax-deductible until settlement. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. At each balance sheet date deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group set off for the presentation proposes deferred income tax assets against deferred income tax liabilities at the companies' level.
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(r) Retirement severance provision
The Group makes contributions to the Government's retirement benefit scheme. The state plan is funded on a pay-as- you-go basis, i.e. the Group is obliged to pay the contributions as they fall due and if the Group ceases to employ members of the state plan, it will have no obligation to pay any additional benefits. The state plan is defined contribution plan. The expense for the contributions is charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Employees of the Group are entitled to retirement severance payment which is paid out on the non-recurrent basis at the moment of retiring. The amount of payment is defined in the labour law. The Group does not exclude assets that might serve in the future as a source of settling liabilities resulting from retirement payments. The Group creates provision for future liabilities in order to allocate costs to the periods they relate to. The Group's obligation in respect of retirement severance provision is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the liability is calculated by actuary and is based on forecasted individual's entitlements method.

(s) Interestbearing borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
(t) Grants from the disabled fund The Group's subsidiary (AMS S.A.) receives grants from the state to fund acquisition of fixed assets, which are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching thereto (related to employment of disabled persons). The grants are recognised in the income statement as other operating revenues on a systematic basis over the useful life of the respective assets.
(u) Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
(v) Revenue recognition Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of value added tax (VAT), returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of services or goods to third parties. (i) Sale of goods Revenues are recognised when the conditions of sale have been met, no significant uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the goods (significant risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer) and the amount can be measured reliably. (ii) Sale of services Revenue from sales of advertising services is recognized as services are provided. (iii) Interest income Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method). (iv) Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

(w) Impairment losses
The carrying amount of the Group's assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy n), and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy p) for which other procedures should be applied, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets' recoverable amount is estimated (the higher of net selling price and value in use). The value in use is assumed to be a present value of discounted future economic benefits which will be generated by the assets.
An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.

At each balance sheet date the Group reviews recognised impairment losses whether there is any indication showing that some of the recognised impairment losses should be reversed. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversal on an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed.
(x) Operating lease payments
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
(y) Finance lease
Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases. Assets acquired under finance lease agreements are initially recognised at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The initial value is then depreciated and diminished by any impairment charges. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain the ownership by the end of the lease term, the leased asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. In other cases the depreciation policy is consistent with that for depreciable assets that are owned.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is calculated using constant internal rate of return and is recognised as an expense during the lease period.
(z)Borrowing costs
Interest and other costs of borrowing are recorded in the income statement using effective interest rate in the period to which they relate, unless directly related to investments in qualifying assets, which require a substnatial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, in which case they are capitalised.
(aa) Sharebased payments
In Agora Group the share incentive plans fueled by Agora S.A.'s shares are run. These plans fall within the scope of IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment" which came into force from 1 January 2005.
Eligible employees are entitled to purchase investment certificates in closed end mutual fund. The fair value of certificates is determined by applying valuation model, which takes into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund as well as the kind of shares and rights associated with the certificates. The fair value of certificates is included in staff cost with corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of certificates is established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates are purchased. The costs are recognized over the vesting period.
Within the Agora Group the 3-Year-Long Plan is also introduced, described in note 26C. One of the components of the plan is accounted for in accordance with IFRS2. It is a cash-settled plan with rules based on - inter alia - share price quotations and appreciation. In this plan, Eligible employees of the Agora Group (including the Management Board) are entitled to a reward based on the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise. The provision for the cost of the reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Rise, is estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Agora S.A. during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the staff costs in the Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan and accounted into the accruals. The changes in the value are presented in salaries and renumeration.
(ab)Dividend distribution

Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the resolution of the Company's shareholders.
(ac)Related parties
For the purposes of these financial statements, related parties comprise significant shareholders, subsidiaries, associated undertakings, joint-ventures and members of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the Group entities and their immediate family, and entities under their control.
(ad)Accounting for tax exemption in Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
The Group's subsidiary (Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o.) operates in a Special Economic Zone. Income from activities in SEZ is exempt from taxation up to the amount defined by SEZ regulations. The tax exemption is recognised in the Group's income statement in the period to which it relates. Future tax benefits relating to tax exemption are treated as an investment relief and recognised, by analogy, based on the provisions of IAS 12, as deferred tax assets (as described in point p).

(ae) New accounting standards and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
The Group did not early applied new standards and interpretations, which were published and endorsed by the European Union or which will be endorsed in the nearest future and which become effective after the balance sheet date.
Standards and interpretations endorsed by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Transfers of Financial Assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2011 or later).
The Amendments require disclosure of information that enables users of financial statements: - to understand the relationship between transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and the associated liabilities; and - to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity's continuing involvement in derecognised financial assets. The Amendments define "continuing involvement" for the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements.
The Group does not expect the amendments to IFRS 7 to have material impact on the financial statements, because of the nature of the Group's operations and the types of financial assets that it holds.

Standards and interpretations awaiting on endorsement by the European Union:
1) Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First ­ time Adopters (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2011 or later).
The Amendments add an exemption to IFRS 1 that an entity can apply at the date of transition to IFRSs after being subject to severe hyperinflation. This exemption allows an entity to measure assets and liabilities held before the functional currency normalization date at fair value and use that fair value as the deemed cost of those assets and liabilities in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.
The amendment is not expected to have any material impact on the Group's Financial Statements.
2) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012 or later).
The amendments: - require that an entity presents separately the items of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future from those that would never be reclassified to profit or loss. If items of OCI are presented before related tax effects then the aggregated tax amount should be allocated between these sections.

- change the title of the Statement of Comprehensive Income to Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, however, other titles are also allowed to be used.

The amendment is not expected tohave any material impact on the Group's Financial Statements. 3) Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2013 or later).
The Amendments contain new disclosure requirements for financial assets and liabilities that are: -offset in the statement of financial position; or - subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements.
The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.
4) Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation- Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 or later)

The Amendments do not introduce new rules for offsetting financial assets and liabilities; rather they clarify the offsetting criteria to address inconsistencies in their application. The Amendments clarify that an entity currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off if that right is: - not contingent on a future event; and - enforceable both in the normal course of business - and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and all counterparties.
The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.

5) Additions to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015 or later).
This Standard replaces the guidance in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, about classification and measurement of financial assets. The Standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, available for sale and loans and receivable. Financial assets will be classified into one of two categories on initial recognition: -financial assets measured at amortized cost; or - financial assets measured at fair value.
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if the following two conditions are met: - the assets is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and, - its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding.
Gains and losses on remeasurement of financial assets measured at fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that for an investment in an equity instrument which is not held for trading, IFRS 9 provides, on initial recognition, an irrevocable election to present all fair value changes from the investment in other comprehensive income (OCI). The election is available on an individual share-by-share basis. No amount recognised in OCI is ever reclassified to profit or loss at a later date.
The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.

6) Additions to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015 or later).

The 2010 additions to IFRS 9 replace the guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, about classification and measurement of financial liabilities and the derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Standard retains almost all of the existing requirements from IAS 39 on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Standard requires that the amount of change in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of a financial liability designated at initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss, be presented in other comprehensive income (OCI), with only the remaining amount of the total gain or loss included in profit or loss. However, if this requirement creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, then the whole fair value change is presented in profit or loss.
Amounts presented in OCI are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss but may be transferred within equity.
Derivative financial liabilities that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of an unquoted equity instrument whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, are required to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9.
The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.

7) Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015 or later).

These Amendments change the disclosure and restatement requirements relating to the initial application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2009) and IFRS 9 (2010).
The amended IFRS 7 requires to disclose more details about the effect of the initial application of IFRS 9 when an entity does not restate comparative information in accordance with the amended requirements of IFRS 9.
If an entity adopts IFRS 9 on or after 1 January 2013, then it will no longer be required to restate comparative information for periods prior to the date of initial application.
If an entity early adopts IFRS 9 in 2012, then it has a choice either to restate comparative information or to provide the enhanced disclosures as required by the amended IFRS 7.
If an entity early adopts IFRS 9 prior to 2012, then neither restatement of comparative information nor provision of the enhanced disclosures under the amended IFRS 7 are required.
The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.

8) IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements" and IAS 27 (2011) Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
IFRS 10 provides a new single model to be applied in the control analysis for all investees, including entities that currently are Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) in the scope of SIC-12. IFRS 10 introduces new requirements to assess control that are different from the existing requirements in IAS 27 (2008). Under the new single control model, an investor controls an investee when (1) it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvements with the investee, (2) has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that investee and (3) there is a link between power and returns.
The new standard also includes the disclosure requirements and the requirements relating to the preparation of consolidated financial statements. These requirements are carried forward from IAS 27 (2008).
The Group does not expect the new standard to have any impact on the financial statements, since the assessment of control over its current investees under the new standard is not expected to change previous conclusions regarding the Group's control over its investees.
9) IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).

IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements, supersedes and replaces IAS 31, Interest in Joint Ventures. IFRS 11 does not introduce substantive changes to the overall definition of an arrangement subject to joint control, although the definition of control, and therefore indirectly of joint control, has changed due to IFRS 10.
Under the new Standard, joint arrangements are divided into two types, each having its own accounting model defined as follows: -a joint operation is one whereby the jointly controlling parties, known as the joint operators, have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement; - a joint venture is one whereby the jointly controlling parties, known as joint venturers, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
IFRS 11 effectively carves out, from IAS 31, those cases in which although there is a separate vehicle for the joint arrangement, that separation is ineffective in certain ways. These arrangements are treated similarly to jointly controlled assets/operations, under IAS 31, and are now called joint operations. The remainder of IAS 31 jointly controlled entities, now called joint ventures, must be accounted for using the equity method. Proportionate consolidation is no longer possible.
The Group does not expect the new standard to have any material impact on the financial statements, since the assessment of the joint arrangements under the new standard is not expected to result in a change in the accounting treatment of existing joint arrangements.

10) IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
IFRS 12 requires additional disclosures relating to significant judgements and assumptions made in determining the nature of interests in an entity or arrangement, interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates and unconsolidated structured entities.

The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.

11) IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
IFRS 13 replaces the fair value measurement guidance contained in individual IFRSs with a single source of fair value measurement guidance. It defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and sets out disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. IFRS 13 explains `how' to measure fair value when it is required or permitted by other IFRSs. IFRS 13 does not introduce new requirements to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, nor does it eliminate the practicability exceptions to fair value measurements that currently exist in certain standards.
The standard contains an extensive disclosure framework that provides additional disclosures to existing requirements to provide information that enables financial statement users to assess the methods and inputs used to develop fair value measurements and, for recurring fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs, the effect of the measurements on profit or loss or other comprehensive income.

The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.

12) IAS 27 (2011) Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
IAS 27 (2011) carries forward the existing accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 27 (2008) for separate financial statements with some minor clarifications. As well, the existing requirements of IAS 28 (2008) and IAS 31 for separate financial statements have been incorporated into IAS 27 (2011). The Standard no longer addresses the principle of control and requirements relating to the preparation of consolidated financial statements, which have been carried over into IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Group does not expect IAS 27 (2011) to have material impact on the financial statements, since it does not results in a change in the entity`s accounting policy.

13) IAS 28 (2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Venutres (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
There are limited amendments made to IAS 28 :
- Associates and joint ventures held for sale. IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations applies to an investment, or a portion of an investment, in an associate or a joint venture that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. For any retained portion of the investment that has not been classified as held for sale, the equity method is applied until disposal of the portion held for sale. After disposal, any retained interest is accounted for using the equity method if the retained interest continues to be an associate or a joint venture.
- Changes in interests held in associates and joint ventures. Previously, IAS 28 (2008) and IAS 31 specified that the cessation of significant influence or joint control triggered remeasurement of any retained stake in all cases, even if significant influence was succeeded by joint control. IAS 28 (2011) now requires that in such scenarios the retained interest in the investment is not remeasured.
The Group does not expect the amended standard has had material impact on the financial statements.

14) Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes - Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets Venutres (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012 or later).
The 2010 amendment introduces an exception to the current measurement principles based on the manner of recovery in paragraph 52 of IAS 12 for investment property measured using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 by introducing a rebuttable presumption that the carrying value of underlying assets would be recovered entirely by sale. Management's intention would not be relevant unless the investment property is depreciable and held within a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the asset's economic benefits over the life of the asset. This is the only instance in which the presumption can be rebutted. The amendments are not relevant to the Group's financial statements, since the Group does not have any investment properties measured using the fair value model in IAS 40.
15) IAS 19 (2011) Employee Benefits (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
The amendment requires actuarial gains and losses to be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The amendment removes the corridor method previously applicable to recognising actuarial gains and losses, and eliminates the ability for entities to recognise all changes in the defined benefit obligation and in plan assets in profit or loss, which currently is allowed under the requirements of IAS 19. The amendment also requires the expected return on plan assets recognised in profit or loss to be calculated based on the rate used to discount the defined benefit obligation.
The Group analyzes the impact of a new standard on financial statements.
16) IFRIC Interpretation 20: Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
The Interpretation sets out requirements relating to the recognition of production stripping costs, initial and subsequent measurement of stripping activity assets.
The Group does not expect the Interpretation to have any impact on the financial statements since it does not have any stripping activities.
17) Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time adopters - Government Loans (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 or later).
The amendments add a new exception to retrospective application of IFRS. A first-time adopter of IFRS now applies the measurement requirements of financial instruments standards (IAS 39 or IFRS 9) to a government loan with a below-market rate of interest prospectively from the date of transition to IFRS. Alternatively, a first-time adopter may elect to apply the measurement requirements retrospectively to a government loan, if the information needed was obtained when it first accounted for that loan. This election is available on a loan-by-loan basis.

The restatement of equity due to hyperinflation
According to IAS 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies", the Polish economy was regarded as hyperinflationary up to 1996. IAS 29 requires the share capital of the Company to be restated by applying the general price index. Retrospective application of IAS 29 with regard to equity would result in an increase of share capital of the Company with corresponding decrease of retained earnings by the same amount. Consequently, the restatement of equity due to hyperinflation does not affect the value of equity of the Company, only the structure of the equity is affected. Polish regulations, commercial code in particular, do not rule the way how this type of adjustment should be carried out (especially adjustments to equity of companies). Consequently, due to lack of impact on equity of the Company following the hyperinflationary adjustment and lack of regulations in polish law, the Company did not post any adjustment to equity as a consequence of IAS 29 application.

12. RETAINED EARNINGS AND OTHER RESERVES Dividends

Retained earnings may be distributed subject to certain minimum capital maintenance restrictions, stipulated in the commercial companies' code and according to dividend policy announced by the Company.

Frame dividend policy announced by the Company on 14 February of 2005 provides for return of excess cash to shareholders through annual dividend and ­ if the situation warrants ­ share repurchases (with cancellation) in connection with the Company's perspectives and market conditions.

Due to uncertainty about availability of future tax profits (some radio companies) or uncertainty as to realisation for tax purposes the Group did not recognise certain deferred tax assets concerning some temporary differences and tax losses.
The amounts of deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses available together with expiry dates for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised are shown in the table below:

In December 2011, the Company set up a provision for costs of compensation and severances for a former Management Board Member Tomasz Jozefacki.
(v) Provision for legal claims
The Group is a defendant in court cases. As at 31 December 2011 the Group evaluated the risk of loss and payment of indemnities in those cases. The amount of indemnities was determined based on consultation with Group's lawyers taking into account the present status of those cases and information available.
(vi) Provision connected with the sentence passed by the Constitutional Tribunal
The provision was set up for possible costs of leveling salaries of employees from the period July 2005 - July 2008 and stems from the sentence passed by the Constitutional Tribunal concerning the interpretation of calculation rules for sick benefits. In 2011, the provision was reversed due to finishing the 3-year period, in which the employees could put forward a motion on settlement of sickness benefits.

20. SALES AND OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION
(a) Operating segment information
In these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, information on operating segments are presented on the basis of components of the entity that management monitors in making decisions about operating matters. Operating segments are components of an entity, about which separate financial information is available, that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in the process of decision making regarding allocation of resources and assessing the performance of the Group.
For management purposes, the Group is organized into business units based on their products and services, and has six reportable operating segments as follows:
1) the Newspapers segment includes the Group's following activities: Special Projects (including book collections) and publishing of Gazeta Wyborcza as well as Metro (including operating activities of the Agora's Printing Department, Agora Poligrafia Sp. z o.o., which focus mainly on printing of these two newspapers),
2) the Internet segment includes the following Group's activities: the Internet and multi-media products and services, (the Agora's Internet department, Trader.com (Polska) Sp. z o.o., LLC Agora Ukraine, AdTaily Sp. z o.o. and from November 30, 2011 Sport4People Sp. z o.o.),
3) the Magazines segment comprises the Group's activities on publishing the magazines within Agora's Magazine Department and Agora Press Ltd. (only till the end of July 2010),
4) the Outdoor segment includes the activities within the AMS Group, which provides advertising services on different forms of outdoor advertising panels,
5) the Radio segment includes the Group's activities within local radio stations, super-regional TOK FM radio and Agora's Radio Department,
6) the Cinema segment includes the Group's activities within the cinema management of Helios S.A. (till August 31, 2011 consolidated financial statements of two companies: Helios S.A. and Kinoplex Sp. z o.o.) comprising multiplexes as well as traditional cinemas. The Group decided to recognise a new operating segment because of its specific business characteristics to start from August 31, 2010 that is from the date of transaction closure as for share acquisition of Helios S.A. (more on business combination in note 32).

Accounting policies for operating segments are the same as followed by the Agora Group, besides some issues described below.
Data within each reportable segment are consolidated pro-forma. The Management Board monitors mainly the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss.
Operating results of reportable segments do not include:

a) revenues and total cost of cross-promotion of Agora's different media if such promotion is executed without prior reservation between segments of the Agora Group; the direct variable cost of campaigns carried out on advertising panels is the only cost that is included above; it is allocated from the Outdoor segment to other segments,
b) amortisation recognised on consolidation (described below).
Group financing (including finance costs and finance revenue) and income tax are managed on a Group level and are not allocated to operating segments.

Operating depreciation and amortisation includes amortisation of intangible assets and fixed assets of each segment.
Amortisation recognised on consolidation can be defined as consolidation adjustments, inter alia: the amortisation of intangible assets and adjustments to property, plant and equipment recognised directly on consolidation.
Impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses show impairment losses and their reversals presented in other operating expenses and income. They include mainly impairment losses on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, trade receivables and the cost of liquidation of non-financial tangible assets.
Amount of investment in associates and joint ventures accounted for by the equity method include the amounts of loans granted in the reported period, paid-in capital, acquired and contributed shares by Agora S.A. The financials presented for years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 relate to A2 Multimedia Sp. z o.o. Business Ad Network Sp. z o.o. (from 28 April 2010) and also to GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. (from 29 December 2011).

26. INCENTIVE PLANS BASED ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS During periods covered by these financial statements, the following incentive plans were carried out in the Group: A. Incentive Plan based on equity-settled share-based payments, B. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Stock Incentive Plan for the management (carried out until the end of 2004), C. Incentive Plan based on realization on operating result goal and share price increase (from 2010).

A. Incentive plan based on equitysettled sharebased payments (carried out from 2005)

Eligible employees of the Agora Group participate in an incentive plan based on investment certificates in a closed end mutual fund designated to service the plan and managed by Towarzystwo Funduszy Inwestycyjnych Skarbiec SA. The number of certificates granted depends on meeting performance criteria, not on market conditions.

Detailed information on Incentive Plans for 2009 and 2010 were presented in the consolidated financial statements for the year of 2009 and 2010 respectively.

In 2011 a new Incentive Plan based on equity-settled share-based payments (investment certificates) has been launched.

During the vesting period Agora Holding Sp. z o.o. has an irrevocable, unconditional right to buy back certificates for the purchase price.

The fair value of certificates is determined by applying valuation model, which takes into consideration such variables as: market value of Agora's shares, which are disposed on behalf of the investment fund, specific characteristics and running costs of the fund, type of transferred shares and rights and limitations associated with the certificates. Consequently, the discount factor was established at the level of 23.6% (detailed description of the valuation model is disclosed below).
The fair value of certificates is established as at the grant date and posted to the income statement from the month following the month in which certificates are purchased by the eligible employees. The costs are recognized over the vesting period.
Historical ratio of forfeited certificates (FR ratio, described below) adjusts the number of certificates granted included in the calculation of incentive plan cost (due to non-compliance with conditions attached to the scheme - obligation

to work in the Group, in particular).
The fair value of investment certificates and the total cost of the Group as at the grant date were determined using the following formula:

FMV = (B-S@grant date) x (1-CD), Cost = FMV x IC x (1-FR)

where: 1. FMV - fair market value of certificate as at the grant date,

2. B-S@grant date - the value of certificates as at the grant date, calculated using Black - Scholes model (B- S), with following assumptions:

a. the value of certificates as at the grant date was determined as 6 month European call option for Agora's shares as at that date,

b. parameters of B-S model:

B. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Stock Incentive Plan for the management (carried out until the end of 2004)
In these plans, Agora Holding Sp. z o.o. sold Agora's shares to eligible employees for fixed price of PLN 1 for each share with the following restrictions: they were registered, not admitted for public trade and could not be sold for a period of up to 10 years.
During the vesting period Agora Holding Sp. z o.o. has had an irrevocable right to buy back shares for PLN 1 in case of non-compliance with share incentive plan regulations by employees.
The number of shares granted depended on meeting performance criteria (non-market criteria) by eligible managers.
The shares outstanding are as follows (including shares granted to Members of the Management Board of Agora S.A.):

The shares granted have vesting and selling restrictions (with selling obligation) for the period from 5 to 10 years.
The shares not vested yet as at December 31, 2004 were granted before November 7, 2002; consequently they are outside the scope of IFRS 2 (they are not valued and recognised in the books). As a result they do not affect the results and equity of the Group.
All shares have full dividend and voting rights.
Shares purchased by the Management Board and Supervisory Board Members (til the end of 2004)

Till the end of 2004, Agora's shares purchased by the current Management Board members and a one of current superviosry Board member acquired in accordance with the employee incentive plans as well as following the change of the legal form of the Company for PLN 1 from Agora Holding Sp. z o. o.

C ­ Incentive plan based on realization on operating result goal and share price increase (from 2010)
Eligible employees of the Company (the Management Board and top managers) participate in incentive program based on two components ("3-Year-Long Incentive Plan") described below:
(i) the stage of realisation of the target based on the operating EBITDA of the Agora Group ("the EBITDA target"). The target is based on the accumulated operating EBITDA (excluding some adjustements, for example related to business combinations) to be reached in the years 2010-2012. The amount of potencial reward depends on the

stage of the EBITDA target fulfillment and will be determined on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group for the period of 2010-2012. If the stage of achieving the target will be up to 70%, the EBITDA target is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan,
(ii) the percent of Company's share price increase ("the Target of Share Price Increase"). The amount of potential reward in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan will depend on the share price increase in the future, accounted as the difference between the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the period of January 1, 2010 till March 31, 2010, that is equal to PLN 23.09 ("the Basic Share Price") and the average of the quoted closing Company's share prices in the period of January 1, 2013 till March 31, 2013 ("the Reference Share Price"), but not more than PLN 35.00, adjusted by: (i) the accumulated dividend per one share, to which the shareholders will be eligible in the period of April 1, 2010 till March 31, 2013 and (ii) the adjustments resulting from the share-buy back program in the period of April 1, 2010 till March 31, 2013 ("the Share Price for Reward Calculation"). If the Share Price for Reward Calculation will be lower than PLN 25.41, the Target of Share Price Increase is not satisfied and the reward will not be granted in this component of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan.
The reward for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan depends also on the fulfillment of other conditions, which are non-market conditions (for example: continuation of the employment within the Agora Group, holding the same post).
The rules, goals, adjustments and conditions for 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan fulfillment for the Management Board members are described in the Supervisory Board resolution and for top managers in the Management Board resolution.
The fair value of potential reward from the fulfillment of the EBITDA target has been calculated on the basis of the best estimate of the expected fulfillment value of the EBITDA target and is charged to the Income Statement over the whole period of the Incentive Plan, in proportion of the actual accumulated EBITDA operating level of the Group (excluding any adjustments) reached from January 1, 2010 till the balance sheet of the current financial statements in the estimated value of the operating EBITDA target.
The fair value of the provision for the cost of potencial reward concerning the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase, was estimated on the basis of the Binomial Option Price Model (Cox, Ross, Rubinstein model), which takes into account ­ inter alia ­ actual share price of the Company (as at the balance sheet date of the current financial statements) and volatility of the share price of Company during the last 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. The value is charged to the Income Statement in proportion to the full period of the 3-Year-Long Incentive Plan, that is from December 1, 2010 (the grant date) till June 30, 2013 (the vesting date). The basic parameters of the Binomial Option Price Model used for calculation of the fair value of the potential reward from the realization of the Target of Share Price Increase and the cost to the Income statement of the Agora Group for the period, are described below:

32. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
 Acquisition of the Capital Group Helios S.A.
On August 31, 2010 Agora S.A. acquired 84.44% of shares (entitling to 84.44% of votes at the general meeting of shareholders) of the company Helios S.A. with its registered seat in Lodz ("Helios"). As a result of this transaction it became indirecty the shareholder in a subsidiary of Helios ­ Kinoplex Sp. z o.o. (100% share in share capital) with its seat in Lodz. Both companies constituted the Capital Group of Helios S.A. (`Helios group'). The remaining 15.56% of shares of Helios at the moment of share purchase have belonged to four natural persons, two of them being Management Board members of Helios. In November 2010, the company issued additional 2% shares for key managers. Due to this issue, Agora's share in capital share of Helios has decreased from 84.44% to 82.78%. Agora has also signed with the above mentioned key managers, who have had 14.08% share in share capital(after issuing 2% of the shares) agreements to grant conditional option rights for their shares (call option for the Company to buy shares held by them and put option as for a liability to acquire these shares by the Company).
Business combination accounting
The Helios Group is fully consolidated starting from August 31, 2010.
Accounting for acquisition of Helios has been made according to the best knowledge of the Company at the date of the publication of this report and has not been changed since the date of the publication of the report for the third quarter of 2010. Under IFRS 3, the Company had a 12 month measurement period since the acquisition date for determining the final difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Completion of the identification and valuation process has not resulted in adjustments to recognised assets and liabilities as well as recognizing additional assets and liabilities, not recognised till now, which could have affected the amount of goodwill recognised.
Recognition of the put option in the consolidated financial statements
Put options granted to the non-controlling shareholders meet the definition of an other financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and were recognised in the consolidated financial statements of Agora Group.
The estimated redemption amount of the put options classified as a financial liability is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet of the Agora Group and at initial recognition decreased retained earnings (line item in the consolidated balance sheet of the Agora Group: Retained earnings and other reserves). As at December 31, 2011, its value is estimated to PLN 26,409 thousand (31 December 2010: PLN 29,669 thousand) - line item in the consolidated balance sheet of the Agora Group: other financial liabilities.
On August 31, 2011 the District Court for the city of Lodz, XX Commercial Division, registered the merger by transfer of all assets and liabilities of Kinoplex Sp. z o.o. to Helios S.A. (the incorporating company). The merger was executed in accordance with the article 516 §6 of the Commercial Companies Code (simplified merger by take over), i.e. due to the fact that the acquired company was a one man company and its sole shareholder was Helios S.A., the merger took place without a resolution of a general meeting of shareholders of the incorporating company by means of transfer of all the assets and liabilities of Kinoplex Sp. z o.o. to Helios S.A. The merger was effected without increasing the share capital of Helios S.A.
 On February 24, 2011 the District Court for the city of Cracow, XI Commercial Division, registered the increase of the share capital of AdTaily by 48 new shares with nominal value of PLN 50 per share (in total PLN 2.4 thousand). The Company covered the new shares with PLN 252 thousand contribution. The agio was recognized in other reserves. The AdTaily's share capital amounted to PLN 33,350 and consisted of 667 shares with nominal value PLN 50 per share. As a result of the above transaction Agora S.A. had 487 shares constituting 73.01% of the share capital and had right to 73.01% votes at shareholders' meeting.

 Acquisition of Sport4People Sp. z o.o.
On November 25, 2011 as a result of the purchase of shares from the company's owners and acquisition of new shares through an increase of the share capital Agora S.A. became an owner of 93 shares of the company Sport4People Sp. z o.o. ("Sport4People") constituting 51.67% of the share capital and has right to 51.67% votes at the shareholders' meeting. Agora has also signed with the owners an investment agreement to grant conditional option rights for their remaining shares (call option for the Company to buy shares held by them and put option as for a liability to acquire these shares by the Company).
Business combination accounting
Accounting for acquisition of Sport4People has been made according to IFRS 3. The Group decided to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquired company at the non-controlling interest`s proportionate share of the acquiree`s identifiable net assets. The Company is fully consolidated starting from November 30, 2011.
From the date of acquisition till December 31, 2011, Sport4People has contributed a loss of PLN 3 thousand and revenues of PLN 33 thousand to the net profit and revenues of the Agora Group, respectively. If the acquisition had occured at the beginning of the year, the revenue of the Agora Group for the period ended 31 December 2011 would have been PLN 1,235.0 million and the net profit would have been PLN 43.9 million. The acquisition-related costs of PLN 11 thousand have been expensed and included in administrative expenses in the profit and loss statement of the Agora Group. The fair value of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date is as follows:

Goodwill
Goodwill is attributable inter alia to the skills, experience and knowledge of the workforce. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Recognition of the put option in the consolidated financial statements
Put options granted to the non-controlling shareholders meet the definition of an other financial liability under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and were recognised in the consolidated financial statements of Agora Group. Non-controlling shareholders holding put options have retained their rights to the economic benefits associated with the underlying shares.
The estimated redemption amount of the put options classified as a financial liability as at December 31, 2011, recognised in the consolidated balance sheet of the Agora Group amounted to PLN 1,126 thousand and decreased Retained earnings and other reserves. Subsequent changes in the value of the liability will be recognised through the income statement. The value of the Agora`s liability related to put options is calculated on the basis of the estimated, dicounted option exercise price, which depends on the estimated future value of the Sport4People equity, which is calculated on the basis of a constant EV/net profit multiplier specified in the investment agreement and estimated future values of net profit. The range of future values of this liability is difficult to estimate, because it depends on net profit growth in future.
 On December 15, 2011, the shareholders of AdTaily Sp. z o.o. adopted a resolution to increase the share capital of AdTaily by 145 new shares with nominal value of PLN 50 per share (in total PLN 7.25 thousand). Agora covered the new shares with PLN 761.25 thousand contribution. The agio was recognized in other reserves. The AdTaily's share capital amounts to PLN 42 thousand and now consists of 840 shares with nominal value PLN 50 per share. As a result of the above transaction Agora S.A. has 632 shares constituting 75.24% of the share capital and has right to 75.24% votes at shareholders' meeting. The increase of the share capital has not been registered till the date of publication of this financial statements.
 On December 29, 2011, the Company signed an agreement to purchase shares in GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. and shareholders agreement of GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. with its registered seat in Warsaw ("the company", "GoldenLine"). As a result of signing the aforementioned agreements, Agora acquired 72 shares constituting 36% of the company's share capital and entitling Agora to 72 votes giving the right to 36% of the total number of votes at the meeting of shareholders of the company ("the Shares"). The total purchase price for the Shares amounts to PLN 11,520 thousand. The Company is accounted for using the equity method under IAS 28.
Under IAS 28 requirements, the Company made a valuation of fair value of assets of GoldenLine Sp. z o.o. As a result, two intangible assets were identified, which met the condition of identifiability under IFRS 3 and IAS 38, not presented up till now in the balance sheet of this company, that is: a GoldenLine domain and the value of IT software & technology. Because the purchase consideration (calculated for 100% shares) exceeds fair value of acquired identifiable assets, the goodwill was recognized in the amount of PLN 14,955 thousand (PLN 5,384 thousand accounted for 36% share in GoldenLine). Under IAS 28, identified intangible assets are not presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group separately and they are part of the value of the investment in the equity accounted investee.
On the basis of the modified articles of association and shareholders agreement executed between Agora S.A. and existed shareholders ("Shareholders"), Agora received a number of rights typical for a non-controlling shareholder.
On the basis of the shareholders agreement, Shareholders may take advantage of their right to sell their shares to Agora and Agora may use its right to purchase the shares owned by the Shareholders, but those rights do not constitute irrevocable obligations of the other party as each party can free itself from those obligations by voting at a general meeting of shareholders for alternative ways of giving liquidity to the shares owned by Shareholders.

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Risk management framework
The Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Company Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Company Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The biggest customers (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). Because the value of transactions with none of distributors of the Group has exceeded 10% of the total revenue of the Group, the concentration of customers does not exist. As a result, the Group's credit risk is limited due to a great number and diversification of customers.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Based on historic default rates, the Group do not create impairment allowances for receivables from related companies, trade receivables that are past due by up to 90 days or for barter receivables; around 90 percent of the balance, which includes the amount owed by the Group's most significant customers relates to customers that have a good payment record.
Investments
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in liquid securities.

Guarantees
The information on guarantees and promissory notes are descibed in note 36.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, as ast December 31, 2011, the Group maintains line of credit in Bank Pekao S.A presented in note 13 and payment deadlines concerning trade payables are described in note 19.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return rate.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is related to purchases of newsprint which is contracted in EURO, fixed asset purchases and rent of premises which are also partly contracted in foreign currencies, mainly EURO and USD.
Cash nad cash equivalents denominated in foreign currency amounted to PLN 1,198 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2010: PLN 1,248 thousand), mainly in EURO and USD.
Accounts receivable in foreign currency amounted to PLN 1,891 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2010: PLN 3,885 thousand), principally in USD and EURO.
Accounts payable requiring settlement in foreign currency amounted to PLN 7,581 thousand as at balance sheet date (31 December 2010: PLN 5,908 thousand), payable principally in EURO and USD.
The Group does not hedge against exchange rate risk on a long term basis (because of the high cost of long term hedging). From time to time, the Group may still enter into short term forward currency contracts with maturity up to three months.
Agora S.A. has not been or was in 2011 engaged in any currency option instruments or other derivatives (used for hedging or speculative ones).

Interest rate risk
The Group invests in short-term deposits and short-term securities with variable interest rates. All the deposits and securities mature within one year.
Additionally, the Group has interest bearing bank loans, other loans and finance lease aggrements with interest at a floating rate based on WIBOR 1M or 3M.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group's processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour. Operational risks arise from all of the Group's operations.
The Group's objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of possible financial losses and possible damage to the Group's reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.

The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas:
 requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions,  requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions,  compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements,  documentation of controls and procedures,  up-to-date analysis of the causes of operational results and setting remedial actions if a operational loss appeared or the probability of happening significant operational risk,  training and professional development,  ethical and business standards,  risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
Compliance with Group's standards is supported by a programme of periodic reviews undertaken by Internal Audit. The results of Internal Audit reviews are discussed with the management of the business unit to which they relate, with summaries submitted to the Audit Committee and senior management of the Group.
Capital management
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Further growth of the Group is the Management Board's overarching priority and the Group plans to use its capital in order to achieve that objective, building its long term value through acquisitions and greenfield projects. The Management Board monitors the ratio levels: ROCE and the paid dividend per share. Each decision concerning dividend payments or share repurchases is made after conducting proper analyses of the Company's financial position, investment capacity at the time, the balance sheet structure and the Company's share price quoted on the stock exchange and is approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
In the reported period there were no changes in the capital management policy.
The Management Board focuses on keeping the balance between possibility to reach higher rate on return ratio (if the debt level is higher) and advantages and security reached at the stable capital level.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are obligated to obey externally defined capital rules.
Sensitivity analysis
a) Interest rate risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposits and credits, loans). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at December 2011, assuming a +/- 1pp change in interest rates, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to be equal to PLN 709 thousand (as at December 31, 2010: PLN 590 thousand).
b) Foreign currency risk
The Group has many financial instruments (including bank deposit, receivables and payables). Their fair values and the fair value of future cash flows connected with them may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. As at December 2011, assuming the appreciation/depreciation of Polish zloty by 10%, the fair value of financial instruments that will fluctuate, is estimated to be equal to PLN 747 thousand (as at December 31, 2010: PLN 87 thousand).

3) Fair value hierarchy for financial instruments
The Group applies the following hierarchy for disclosing information about fair value of financial instruments ­ by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are observable, directly or indirectly, market data; Level 3: valuation techniques in which inputs that are significant to fair value measurement are not based on observable market data.

The table below shows financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date:

35. CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS Contractual capital and investment commitments (mainly fixed and intangible assets) existing at the balance sheet date amounted to PLN 20,529 thousand (31 December 2010: PLN 26,360 thousand). As at balance sheet date, future capital and investment expenditures budgeted by the Group for the following 12 months amounted to PLN 140,630 thousand (31 December 2010: PLN 96,161 thousand).

The total amount of the contingencies, guarantees and other collaterals is smaller than 10% of the Group's equity.
Additionally, Helios S.A. issued blank promissory notes as collaterals for bank loan agreements and finance lease agreements (described in note 13) and guarantees on rent agreements.
Advertising panels dismantling costs
Majority of lease agreements for rent of space for advertising panels includes an obligation to remove panels and restore the space to its previous condition. Agreements are usually concluded for finite periods, shorter than the useful life of the panels. Despite provisions of the agreements, the necessity to uninstall the panel will depend on future decisions taken at the end of the lease period. Based on the experience of AMS S.A., the majority of the agreements are prolonged without any expenditures on restoration. Taking into account these uncertainties, AMS SA decided to recognize expenditures on restoration when incurred or when the decision to restructure the panels is taken (including restoration). The restoration costs amounted to in PLN 605 thousand in 2011 and PLN 879 thousand in 2010.
Panels situated near the side of a road
AMS S.A. finished in Warsaw the process of moving its large format advertising panels to localizations outside the side of the road. Mounting the panels of the type Backlight 18 square meters, Backlight 32 square meters, Billboard 18 square meters and Cityscroll 9 square allowed to increase the sales potential of Premium and Superpremium segments and enabled to become entirely independent from the city policy regarding the side of the road.
AMS received many administrative fines for using the waysides for its panels. The appeal procedures are conducted in front of the Local Self-government Appeal Committee (Samorzadowe Kolegium Odwolawcze) or in front of the Voivodeship Administrative Court (Wojewodzki Sad Administracyjny). In accordance with the resolution taken by the Management Board of AMS on March 31, 2007, the company set up provisions for possible administrative fines in the amount of PLN 3,598 thousand as at December 31, 2011. Bearing in mind the up-to-date results of the appeal

procedures and a possible occurrence of them in the future, the Management Board of AMS does not see a need to change the current procedure for the set-up of this provision.

37. COMMITMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are primarily for the lease of outdoor locations for advertising panels, land and buildings and are summarised as follows:

Within one year Between one and five years More than five years Total

31 December 2011 75,750

Following types of transactions are witnessed within the Agora Group:  advertising and printing services,  rent of machinery, office and other fixed assets,  providing various services: legal, financial, administration, trade, sharing market research results, outsorcing,  grant and repayment of loans and interest revenues and costs,  dividend distribution.
All transactions within the Agora Group are carried out on arm's length basis and are within the normal business activities of companies.

40. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and best knowledge of the Group as at the date of the estimation. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities concern impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful life (magazine titles). In order to determine their recoverable amounts the cash flow forecasts have been prepared.
There are two key assumptions identified, which have the most significant impact on the estimated recoverable amount of the assets:
1) estimated rate of real free cash flow to firm after the period of detailed forecast and
2) pre-tax discount rate.

Basic information about the method applied is summarized below:

Cash generating unit relating to
activities in Trader.com (Polska) - Internet

A group of cash generating units relating to activities
in particular magazine titles

Cash generating unit relating to radio activities

Cash generating unit relating to activities in AMS

REVENUE PLN 1,234.6 MILLION NET PROFIT PLN 43.8 MILLION OPERATING EBITDA PLN 154.4 MILLION OPERATING CASH FLOW PLN 152.2 MILLION FREE CASH FLOW PLN 78.9 MILLION
Unless indicated otherwise, all data presented herein represent the period of 2011, while comparisons refer to 2010. All data sources are presented in part IV of this MD&A.

 According to the Agora Group (`the Group') estimates, in 2011, advertising spending for all media in Poland amounted to ca PLN 7.8 billion, i.e. over 1.5% more than in 2010. At that time, advertisers increased their advertising expenditure in all media except for press and outdoor.

Advertising budgets in press decreased by ca 8% yoy. Advertisers spent by 12.5% less yoy in newspapers and by over 4.5% less yoy in magazines. The outdoor spendings decreased by 0.5% yoy.
 On August 31, 2010 Agora S.A. signed a definitive agreement to purchase a majority stake of the company Helios S.A. (former Centrum Filmowe Helios S.A.). The consolidated profit and loss statements of the Agora Group for 2011 include the profit and loss statements of Helios S.A. (till August 31, 2011 the consolidated capital group Helios S.A.; further referred to as "Helios") for 2011. However, due to the date of the acquisition of the Helios by Agora S.A., the consolidated profit and loss statement of the Agora Group for 2010 included profit and loss statement of Helios with the financial results only for the period of September ­ December of 2010.
 Revenues of the Group in 2011 were higher by 10.6% yoy and amounted to PLN 1,234.6 million. A positive influence on the level of the Group's revenues had a consolidation of cinema segment revenues (in the same period of 2010, the cinema segment contributed only revenues achieved in the period September ­ December of 2010). The revenue from the ticket sales in 2011 reached PLN 146.3 million and increased yoy. The Group's advertising revenues in 2011 decreased by 1.4% yoy to PLN 705.6 million. The revenues from copy sales stood at PLN 192.8 million (down by 7.7% yoy). Revenues from other sales increased by 24.9% yoy to PLN 189.9 million, mainly due to the revenues from food and beverages sales in the Helios cinemas and higher by 20.4% yoy sales of printing services for external clients.
 In 2011, Gazeta's advertising sales reached PLN 256.1 million (down by 16.3% yoy). Gazeta's copy sales revenues decreased by 10.1% yoy to PLN 131.3 million. In 2011, Gazeta sold 306 thousand copies on average and its share in the advertising expenditure in dailies amounted to 37% [4].
 In 2011, the advertising sales in the Free Press division amounted to PLN 30.4 million and decreased by 3.2% yoy. The share of Agora's free newspaper in dailies ad spend increased by nearly 0.5 pp and reached ca 4.5% [3]. During the discussed time, the division's operating result (EBIT) amounted to PLN 4.5 million and was higher by PLN 0.8 million than in 2010 [1].
 In 2011, revenues of the Internet segment amounted to PLN 114.0 million and increased by 12.0% yoy. Revenues from the display ad sales increased by 18.3% yoy. In December 2011, the reach of online services
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 5

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year2011 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
from Gazeta.pl group amounted to 61.3% and made it the third most popular Internet portal in Poland. The number of its users increased by 1.7% yoy and reached 11.7 million people [6].  In 2011, revenues of the AMS group increased by 6.6% yoy to PLN 175.0 million. The segment improved its operating result EBIT to PLN 15.0 million. AMS group increased its share in outdoor advertising market by almost 4pp yoy to 30% [8].  In 2011, revenues of the magazine business reached PLN 75.3 million and dropped by 9.9% yoy. The operating result of the segment was negatively affected by an impairment loss on selected titles in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result,segment's operating EBITDA decreased to PLN 2.4 million in 2011 [1].  In 2011, the Radio segment revenues grew by 11.0% yoy to PLN 86.1 million. The segment achieved a positive operating EBIT of PLN 3.4 million, which was lower yoy, mainly due to outlays for improvement in the quality of programming offer.  In 2011, the revenues of the cinema segment were higher than in 2010 and amounted to PLN 203.9 million. The number of tickets sold in the Helios cinemas increased by 8.7% yoy reaching 8.3 million tickets. The operating result of Helios (EBIT) was better than in 2010 and amounted to PLN 15.4 million.  In 2011, total net operating cost of the Group increased by 14.6% yoy and reached PLN 1,182.7 million. The growth in the operating cost results mainly from the cost incurred by Helios (in 2010 only the cost incurred by Helios in the period of September ­ December burdened the Group's operating cost). If the operating cost of Helios was excluded from the Group's profit and loss account, the Group's operating cost would grow by ca 3% yoy.  In 2011, operating EBITDA of the Group decreased by 13.1% yoy to PLN 154.4 million. The Group's operating result EBIT decreased yoy to PLN 51.9 million and the Group's net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent amounted to PLN 42.2 million.  At the end of December 2011, the Group's cash and short-term monetary assets amounted to PLN 323.4 million, out of which PLN 125.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and PLN 197.9 million in secure short - term securities.  The Group's debt amounted to PLN 213.0 million at the end of December 2011. Since August 31, 2010 the Group's debt includes the debt of Helios S.A. (including: bank credits, loans and finance lease liabilities), amounting to PLN 87.2 million as at the end of December 2011.  As a result of verification of the financial projections of the business segments of the Agora Group carried out in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Group recognized an impairment loss in the total amount of PLN 14.3 million. The above one-off cost of impairment loss affected the consolidated results of the Group and unconsolidated results of the appropriate companies from the Group in 2011 (it also impacted the deferred tax).  Moreover, in 2011 a positive effect on the Group's net profit had verification of the value of put option, granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A., by PLN 3.3 million conducted in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). As at December 31, 2011 the estimated redemption value of put option amounted to PLN 26.4 million and was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet of the Agora Group as other financial liability. According to IFRS subsequent changes in the value of the liability will be recognised through the subsequent income statements. The value of the Agora`s liability related to put options is calculated on the basis of the estimated, dicounted option exercise price, which depends on the estimated future value of the Helios equity, which is calculated on the basis of a constant EV/EBITDA multiplier specified in agreements and estimated future values of EBITDA and net debt of Helios Group. The range of future values of this liability is difficult to estimate, because it depends on EBITDA growth in future. The EBITDA growth is correlated to the growth in the number of multiplex cinemas, which depends on the number of new shopping centres constructed by developers.

II. EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUP
1. EXTERNAL FACTORS 1.1 Advertising market [3]
Due to the purchase of the majority stake in the company Helios S.A., the Company included advertising expenditure in Polish cinemas in the description of total advertising expenditure. The comparable data for the previous periods has been modified adequately.
In 2011, total advertising expenditure in Poland grew by over 1.5% yoy to ca PLN 7.8 billion.
The highest growth of advertising expenditure was observed in the Internet (up by almost 19% yoy), mainly as a result of growing expenditure in search engines (up by ca 26% yoy). Internet was the only medium in which advertising expenditure grew in each quarter of 2011.
Radio was the second medium in which advertising expenditure grew in 2011 (up by nearly 6.5% yoy). This growth results from the increased advertising expenditure in radio in the first three quarters of 2011 (up by nearly 12.5% yoy), which was partially used up by the decline in radio advertising expenditure in the last quarter of 2011.
In 2011, the value of advertising budgets in TV increased by over 0.5% yoy to PLN 3.9 billion.
In the period of January-December 2011, advertisers increased their expenditure on cinema advertising by over 6.5% yoy, mainly as a result of increased advertising expenditure in this medium in the second and fourth quarter of 2011.
The value of outdoor advertising decreased in 2011 by over 0.5% yoy. The third quarter of 2011 was the only one with the positive growth dynamics in outdoor advertising, mainly due to the advertising outlays for Parliamentary elections in Poland.
Press noted the largest reductions in advertising expenditure in 2011 (down by ca 8% yoy). The largest drop in advertising expenditure was observed in dailies (down by 12.5% yoy). In magazines advertisers spent over 4.5% less than in 2010.
The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market and lack of reliable data on average market discount rates. Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media in subsequent reports.
2. INTERNAL FACTORS 2.1. Revenue
In 2011, the Group's revenues increased by 10.6% yoy to PLN 1,234.6 million. This growth results mainly from including the revenues of the Cinema segment in the Group's results starting from September 1, 2010. Other segments that contributed to the growth of the Group's revenues include: Internet, Outdoor and Radio.
In 2011, the Group's advertising revenues decreased by 1.4% yoy and amounted to PLN 705.6 million. Segments that noted a growth in advertising revenues in 2011 included: Internet (up by 18.3% yoy), Radio (up by 11.5% yoy), Outdoor (up by 6.1% yoy) and Cinema.
The decrease of advertising revenue in Gazeta Wyborcza (down by 16.3% yoy) and in Magazines segment (down by 6.1% yoy) exhorted a negative impact on the level of the Group's advertising revenues.
In 2011, the revenues from copies sold decreased by 7.7% yoy to PLN 192.8 million, mainly due to diminishing revenues from copies sold of Gazeta Wyborcza and magazines.
In 2011, the revenues from the sales of tickets to the Helios cinemas amounted to PLN 146.3 million and were higher than in 2010 (in 2010, only the revenues contributed by the Cinema segment in the period of September ­ December were consolidated in the Group's profit and loss account).
In 2011, other revenues increased by 24.9% yoy to PLN 189.9 million. This growth results mainly from the sales of printing services for external clients (up by 20.4% yoy) and food and beverages sales in the cinemas of Helios

network. In 2010, only the revenues contributed by the Cinema segment in the period of September ­ December were consolidated in the Group's profit and loss account. 2.2. Operating cost Total net operating cost of the Group, in 2011, reached PLN 1,182.7 million and increased by 14.6% yoy. This cost increase is mainly attributable to the cinema business, whose operating cost in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased by 25.0% yoy and in 2011 reached PLN 188.5 million. For the comparison purposes, it should be remembered that in 2010 only the results achieved by the Cinema segment in the period of September - December were consolidated in the Agora Group's profit and loss account. Excluding the operating cost of the cinema business, the Group's net operating cost would have increased by ca 3% yoy in 2011.
The Group's staff cost (excluding non-cash cost of share-based payments) increased by 10.4% yoy in 2011. This increase results mainly from the higher number of employees in the Group due to, inter alia, the purchase of Helios as well as higher cost of contracts of mandate.
The Group's headcount, at the end of 2011, was 3,481 employees, including 321 employees of Helios. The Group's headcount at the end of December 2011 increased by 11 FTEs versus the end of December 2010. The increase in the Group's headcount results mainly from the development projects executed in the Group.
Total estimated non ­ cash expense relating to share - based payments (described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group) charged to the Group's 2011 profit and loss account amounted to PLN 9.7 million.
The Group offers its employees other incentive plans (for example: cash motivation plans, incentive plans in sales departments etc.), which cost is charged to the Group's staff cost. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, the Group's operating result is burdened quarterly by the cost of Three-Year-Long Incentive Plan for the Management Board members and higher managerial personnel (described in note 26C to the consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group). In 2011, this cost amounted to PLN 1.1 million.
The cost of external services in 2011 increased by 24.1% yoy and amounted to PLN 355.4 million, mainly as a result of consolidation of the cinema business in the Group's profit and loss account. In 2010, the Group's operating cost was burdened with the cost of external services incurred by the Helios network only in the period of September - December. The largest components charged to this cost position include: the cost of film copies purchase and cinema space rentals incurred by the cinema business. Additionally, the level of the external services cost is influenced by the purchases of broadcast air-time and the cost of sales of brokerage services. The cost of production services is also included in the cost of external services. The Group managed to decrease significantly the cost of production services due to the launching of the print of heatset supplements to Gazeta Wyborcza in Agora's own printing plant.
In 2011, cost of raw materials, energy and consumables increased by 23.3% yoy to PLN 250.6 million. This increase stems mainly from the raise in the cost of production materials (including cost of newsprint) due to - inter alia - launching the print of heatset supplements to Gazeta Wyborcza in Agora's own printing plant since the fourth quarter of 2010 (previously this cost position was charged to the cost of external services). It is worth stressing that this growth is compensated by the drop in the external services cost. Further factors contributing to the growth of cost of raw materials, energy and consumables in 2011 include an increase in price and volume of printing services for external clients. Additionally, the inclusion in this cost category of the cost of materials and energy belonging to the Helios cinema network contributed to its growth (in 2010 only the results of the Helios cinema network achieved in the period of September ­ December were consolidated in the results of the Agora Group).
In 2011, promotion and marketing expense was PLN 115.1 million and decreased by 12.1% yoy. Most of the segments reduced their advertising expenditure in 2011. The largest savings in advertising expenditure were observed in Newspapers segment.

3. PROSPECTS
3.1. Advertising market
In 2011, total advertising expenditure grew in Poland by over 1.5% yoy.
Taking into account current macroeconomic situation and the condition of the advertising market, the Company estimates that the advertising market in Poland may grow by ca 0-3% yoy in 2012. It should be remembered that the condition of Polish advertising market in 2012 may be influenced by decisions made by international companies on the basis of uncertain economic situation in different parts of Europe or the world disregarding the condition of Polish economy.
In Company's opinion, the Internet will be the medium with the highest growth of advertising expenditure in 2012 (up by 9-12% yoy). Advertising expenditure in cinemas will grow by ca 3-6% yoy. The value of outdoor advertising expenditure, according to the Company's estimates, shall grow by ca 0-3% yoy. Similarly, the value of advertising expenditure in TV and radio may grow by ca 0-3% yoy.
In accordance with the Company's estimates advertisers shall limit their expenditure in press further in 2012. The decrease in dailies may reach ca 14-17% yoy, whereas in magazines ca 6-9% yoy.
The Company would like to stress that one should bear in mind that these advertising market estimations may represent some margin of error due to significant discount pressure on the market, lack of reliable data on the average market discount rate and ongoing change in the way of media consumption and short span of time in planning advertising campaigns.
Once the Company has a more reliable market data in consecutive quarters, it may correct the ad spending estimations in particular media in subsequent reports.
3.2. Operating cost
In 2012, the Group does not anticipate a significant growth in the operating cost. Due to a volatile advertising market situation the Group plans flexible management of operating cost base in order to be able to meet the market conditions in its business segments. However, it should be remembered that the Group's fundamental objective is growth and therefore in case of possibilities to widen its competencies or scale of operation in the segments attractive for the Group's further growth they will be treated as priority.
3.2.1 Cost of external services
In 2012, this cost position shall be dependent on the cost of film copies for the cinema business, EUR/PLN exchange rate and results in radio and Internet brokerage services. Additionally, this cost position may be influenced in 2012 by planned openings of new cinemas.
3.2.2 Staff cost
In 2012, the Group expects a slight yoy increase of the staff cost. The increase in the staff cost is mainly related to the execution of development projects within the Group (including openings of new cinemas) and provisions for motivation plans executed in the Group (described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements of the Agora Group).
3.2.3 Non ­ cash expense relating to share - based payments
Estimated total cost related to share ­ based incentive plans to be charged to the Group's 2012 profit and loss account shall amount to PLN 2.6 million. It should be noted, however, that this amount includes estimated cost of execution of incentive plan but the Company does not in fact know the number of certificates to be purchased by employees pursuant to the future plan, or the stock price of Agora's shares at that accounting period. Hence, for purposes of providing an estimate, the Company assumed that these values will be equivalent to those on which the 2011 calculations were based. The cost of incentive plans are reflected in the Group's P&L according to the accounting rules referred to in note 26A to the consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to these rules, share-based compensation cost will be charged unevenly throughout the year. In the first half of 2012, the Group's P&L will be affected by PLN 1.8 million of outstanding non-cash incentive compensation. The cost of new incentive plan of PLN 0.8 million will be reflected in the Group's P&L in the fourth quarter of 2012.

3.2.4 Promotion and marketing cost Due to the market situation and limited number of promotional campaigns in most of the Agora Group's segments, the promotion and marketing cost decreased in 2011 by 12.1% yoy. The Group does not intend to intensify its promotional and marketing activities in 2012. However, it should be remembered that the level of promotion and marketing expense depends on the dynamics of particular media development, as well as the number of projects (including book series) and the market activities and projects of the Group's competitors. 3.2.5 Cost of raw materials and energy In 2011, the cost of materials and energy increased significantly. This cost category was influenced mainly by launching the print of heatset supplements to Gazeta Wyborcza in Agora's own printing plant since the fourth quarter of 2010, compensated with the decrease of external services cost. Additionally, the growth of unit prices of materials (including newsprint cost) and volume of production for external clients as well as cinema operations (consolidated in the Group's financial results since September 2010) contributed to the growth of this cost position. The level of cost of raw materials and energy in 2012 will be dependent mainly on the price of newsprint, the volume of production and EUR/PLN exchange rate.
3.3. The Group's main objectives in 2012
In 2011, the Group was actively executing all set objectives and it intends to continue these actions throughout current year.
Development of multimedia competencies and strengthening synergies between different media within the Group's portfolio led to effective utilization of the Group's multimedia resources in day ­ to - day activities as well as in development projects. Due to the possibilities offered by the Internet, the Group offered access to its products to new groups of recipients for example by implementing new functionalities in Tuba.fm. Despite the growth projects in the Internet, the so ­ called traditional media launched successfully new projects. The examples include changes in the weekend edition of Gazeta Wyborcza (Holiday Magazine) as well as publishing of a new magazine Ksiazki. Magazyn do czytania (Books. Magazine to read).
Additionally, the Group in accordance with its declarations supplemented and enriched its advertising and product offer, inter alia by means of acquisitions (e.g. GoldenLine.pl). Previous year was also the first, full year of the Group's operations in cinema business. It was a year of integration of a new business segment into the Group's structure and testing different models of co-operation with other segments comprising the Agora Group.
In 2012, the Group activities, apart from the continuation of actions undertaken in 2011, shall be concentrated inter alia, on:
(i) adapting the Group's mode of operation and structure to the market situation and changes taking place in media; (ii) intensification of actions strengthening the synergies among different segments from the Group's portfolio as well as actions taking advantage of the Internet to develop new forms and scope of activities in the so ­ called traditional media segments; (iii) intense growth of both Internet segment and widely understood Internet in the Agora Group; (iv) developing in the cinema business by opening new cinemas; (v) increasing the scale of the Group's operations, also, through further acquisitions strengthening the Group's position and/or diversifying the sources of the Group's revenues.

According to the requirements, it is not possible to compensate the surplus of the recoverable amount on one magazine title (or one cinema) with the shortage on other title (or cinema) within one business segment. As a result, impairment loss on individual cash generating units is recognized even if the total value of the Group's business segment is not impaired (in this case: Magazine and Cinema segments).

(6) revaluation of the "put options" granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A. in the amount of PLN 3.3 million carried out in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

The Group does not depend on one particular customer. The biggest customers of the Group (in respect of the turnover) are press distributors (companies unrelated to Agora S.A.). In 2011, the value of transactions with none of the distributors exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.4. Suppliers
The Group does not depend on one particular supplier. Newsprint and printing services are important cost items of the Group. Newsprint used for printing dailies is purchased from several suppliers. In 2011, the value of transactions with none of the suppliers exceeded 10% of the Group's total revenues.

2.5. Finance cost, net
Net financial activities of the Group in 2011 were negatively affected mainly by bank commissions, as well as interest on the bank loans and lease liabilities. Moreover, in the fourth quarter of 2011 a positive impact on this position had the revaluation of the "put options" granted to the non-controlling shareholders of Helios S.A. in the amount of PLN 3.3 million.

It should be stressed that according to the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group conducts impairment tests for individual cash generating units. As a result, the tests are conducted, inter alia, in relation to each magazine title. According to the requirements, it is not possible to compensate the surplus of the recoverable amount on one magazine title with the shortage on other title within one business segment. As a result, impairment loss on individual cash generating units is recognized even if the total value of the Group's business segment is not impaired (in this case: the Magazines segment).
Due to the impairment loss on several titles, the Magazines segment recorded an operating EBITDA of 2.4 million and the operating EBITDA margin reached the level of 3.2% in 2011 [1]. If the above impairment loss on selected press titles was to be excluded, the Magazines segment would report an operating EBITDA of PLN 13.6 million in 2011.

1. REVENUE
In 2011, total copy sales decreased by 15.5% yoy, while ad sales were down by 6.1% yoy, leading to an overall decline in total sales by 9.9% yoy. The decrease in revenue from copy sales reflects the reduction of the primary editions' cover prices of Poradnik Domowy and Dziecko (introduced in March and May 2011, respectively), as well as the overall market trend of copy sales decline. Advertising sales were down mainly as a result of a reduction in advertising expenditure in interior decoration, construction, hygiene & beauty as well as food & drink categories.

translation only The increase in staff cost (up by 5.3% yoy) in 2011 reflected development of regional sale structure and higher variable remuneration components resulting from higher sales. Another factor significantly contributing to the growth of this cost position were provisions for incentive plans implemented in the Group. In 2011, the decline in other operating cost net allowed to limit the growth of the segment's operating cost. It was mainly related to closing several administrative disputes on using the waysides without permission and lower yoy number of terminated panels. Additionally, in 2011 promotion and marketing cost was reduced (down by 10.0% yoy) due to the smaller scope of social campaigns and joint non-profit /commercial campaigns in the second and third quarter of 2011. The non- profit element of these campaigns is settled in barter and charged to promotion and marketing cost. 3. OTHER EVENTS AMS launched AMS Metrics ­ the first software on the market that calculates effectiveness of campaigns implemented on outdoor panels. With this tool, it is possible to provide basic parameters used in other media such as range, number of contacts, cost of reach. AMS Metrics allows to specify these parameters in outdoor advertising for panels in all major Polish cities. The AMS S.A. sales team was recognized in 2011 as the best sales team in the outdoor market in the prestigious annual ranking of the weekly Media and Marketing Polska. As a part of Bramy Kraju, an urban marketing programme, AMS organised the seventh conference for local government under the name A city after EURO.

translation only It should be stressed that according to the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group conducts impairment tests for individual cash generating units. As a result, the tests are conducted, inter alia, in relation to each cinema in the Helios network. According to the requirements, it is not possible to compensate the surplus of the recoverable amount in one cinema with the shortage in another within one business segment. As a result, impairment loss on individual cash generating units is recognized even if the total value of the Group's business segment is not impaired (in this case: the Cinema segment). 1. REVENUE [3] In 2011, Helios cinemas had 8.3 million visitors (up by 8.7% yoy). The average ticket price in Helios cinemas was PLN 17.62 net (down by over 2% yoy).

COST In 2011, as a result of the annual review of financial projections, the Cinema segment recognized an impairment loss in the total amount of PLN 3.1 million. This loss is related to the tangible fixed assets in one of the cinemas from the Helios network. In 2011, the operating cost of the segment reached PLN 188.5 million and was higher yoy. The increase results mainly from the higher cost of external services, including cost of film copies and rent of commercial space in shopping centres. 3.

12. THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC HAZARDS AND RISK
 Macroeconomic risk
Advertising revenues strictly depend on the general economic situation in Poland and in Europe. They grow in the periods of economic upswing and are marked by considerable decrease in time of the economic slowdown. According to the Company's estimations in 2011, advertisers spent over 1.5% yoy more on advertising. Advertisers increased their expenditure in Internet (by almost 19% yoy), in radio (by nearly 6.5% yoy), in cinema (by over 6.5% yoy) and in TV (by over 0.5% yoy). Other media suffered further erosion of advertising expenditure: dailies down by 12.5%, magazines by over 4.5% and outdoor by nearly 0.5%.

[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 43

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year2011 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
On the basis of the current macroecomic situation as well as on the advertising market, the Company estimates that in 2012 the value of advertising market in Poland will grow by 0-3% boy. It should be remembered, that the growth of Polish advertising market may be affected by the decisions made by large international companies on the basis of the uncertain situation in Europe or other parts of the world disregarding the condition of the Polish economy. Additionally, it should be noted that the level of advertising revenues is dependent on both the ad volume as well as prices of media purchase which hinders estimations regarding the development of the situation at the particular segments of ad market.
 Seasonality of advertising spending
The Group sales revenues are marked by seasonal variation. The Group's revenues in the first and third quarter are usually lower than in the second and fourth quarter of a given financial year.
 Advertising market structure and the position of individual media in readership, TV and radio audience market
The Group's advertising revenues are generated by the following media: dailies, outdoor advertising, radio stations, magazines, internet and cinemas. As a result of structural changes and media convergence particular media in the Agora Group's portfolio compete both with their business competitors and with television broadcasters - constituting nearly half of the advertising market expenditure (49.5%) in 2011. The next largest segment of advertising market ­ Internet held 15.5% share in total ad spend. Ad expenditure in magazines and dailies constituted almost 11% and nearly 8% share of total ad spend, respectively. Outdoor advertising held, in 2011, over 7.5% of the advertising market share and radio ad spend constituted almost 7.5% of total ad expenditure. Cinema advertising in Poland constituted almost 1.5% of all advertising expenditure. Bearing in mind the dynamics of particular and the current estimates of advertising market growth in 2012 there is a risk that the share of particular media in the advertising market will change. This may influence the Group's position and its revenues.
Additionally, as a result of the changes in media described above and consolidation on the advertising market the competition between media grows and it may influence Group's advertising revenues. Moreover, due to those changes and technological progress there is no certainty that the Group will be able to react to them in a proper time and manner, which may negatively influence the Group's position and financial results.
Advertising revenues depend also on the readership figures and shares in radio and television audience. Media market changes dynamically ­ some sectors can take advantage of the current changes while other can lose its position on the market. There is no certainty that the Group's position in the particular media sectors will remain unchanged.  Press distribution
The main channel of press distribution, used by every press publisher in Poland, is networks of kiosks situated in places of intense traffic. Distribution market in Poland is highly concentrated ­ two main distributors control over 80% of press distribution market. Therefore, significant financial or operational problems of either of them may have a negative impact on copy sales and the results of the Group.  Press
Presently paid press experiences a worldwide trend of copy sales decrease and shrinking of advertising expenditure. Press titles, published by the Group and its competitors, are not resistant to the changes taking place on the press market. The process of classifieds migration from press to Internet is taking its place. The dynamics of the above mentioned processes may have a negative impact on dailies copy sales and the revenues of the Group. The Group also publishes a free daily ­ Metro. We cannot predict how the global changes occurring on the press market will influence the free press position and consequently, the position and the results of the Group.  Internet
Polish Internet advertising market is highly competitive. Number of internet users in Poland increases steadily which attracts new advertisers to this medium. The level of Internet ad expenditure is also characterized by seasonality. The first and the third quarters of the financial year are usually characterized by lower revenues and the fourth quarter is marked by higher revenues.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 44

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year2011 to the consolidated financial statements

Internet business is highly dependent on technology progress and number of Internet users and maintaining a strong position on that market is possible by means of investment in modern and innovative technology. In this segment of advertising market the Group competes with local and international players. There is no guarantee, that on such a competitive market, the Group's position and ad revenues will be unchanged.
 Outdoor Outdoor advertising market in Poland is highly competitive. AMS S.A. competes with Polish companies as well as big international concerns. This segment of advertising expenditure is also characterized by seasonality. The highest revenues in this segment are usually noted in the second and fourth quarter. Outdoor advertising market is of high legal risk due to the possible changes in the rules regarding the use of public space and introduction of new limitations in the centers of large urban areas, as well as rules on fees and tax rates related to this business activity. The factors mentioned above may have an impact on the Group's result.
On July 27, 2010 AMS S.A. and Ströer Polska entered into a consortium agreement to jointly apply for a concession contract with the municipal authorities of Warsaw. On July 28, 2010 the companies submitted a motion to execute a consession agreement however, it is a highly competitive process and there is no certainty that the municipal autorities will execute a contract with the consortium AMS and Ströer.
 Cinema Helios group opens new cinemas mainly in shopping centres. Therefore, further development of the cinema network is dependent upon the construction of new shopping galleries in Poland and ability to compete with other cinema operators for new space lease contracts. The pace of polish infrastructure development and the situation on the Polish Real estate market (i.e. cost of space rent) may influence the results of cinema operators. Additionally, the repertoire and number of movies screened in 3D technology affect results of Helios. Moreover, the cinema operators compete with other technologies of film screening, inter alia, cable networks, Internet, home cinema systems or DVD, which may decrease popularity of cinema going.
 Risks of running licensed business The Group comprises local radio stations broadcasting under the brands Zlote Przeboje and Roxy FM and superregional radio TOK FM. Radio broadcasting in Poland is licensed. The license entries determine the scope and form of business during the time for which the license is granted. There is a risk that demand, from listeners, for a certain radio format will decrease, while the Group will not be able to adjust to the market requirements due to the obligation to respect program entries stated in the license.
 Radio stations Polish radio ad market is highly competitive. Agora's radio stations compete with other radio broadcasters, with national and regional reach, as well as other media ­ TV, press, internet and outdoor advertising. To maintain audience share it is important to have a demanded radio format. There is no certainty that the Group's current position in the radio audience market will be unchanged. Competing for ad revenue, radio stations (also belonging to different media concerns), create joint advertising offers. The popularity of these offers may significantly influence the shares of particular radio broadcasters in radio ad market.
 Special Projects The Special Project Department mainly publishes book collections and books with attached CDs & DVDs. There are immense differences in collections' revenue generating and profit - making abilities, which causes variation in revenue and profit level generated by Group's Special Project Department in subsequent reporting periods. Each collection is a separate project and it cannot be assumed that present revenue and profit level will remain constant in future.
[ w w w . a g o r a . p l ] Page 45

Agora Group Management Discussion and Analysis for the year2011 to the consolidated financial statements
translation only
The result for each period depends on the launched collections at that time and how many readers they attract. The other important factor is the level of market saturation with such publications. Additionally, growing popularity of reading books in a digital format makes it a general practice and may influence the results of Special Projects.  Impairment tests
Inline with the International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group runs impairment tests. In the past and in the current period, some of the tests resulted in impairment loss which was reflected in the income statement (unconsolidated and/or consolidated). There is no certainty that the tests run in the future will give positive effects.  Currency risk
The Group's revenues are expressed in Polish zlotys. Part of the operating cost, connected mainly with cinema activities, the printing services, purchase of production materials, mainly newsprint, and gadgets inserted in magazines, is related to the currency exchange rates. The volatility of currency exchange rates may have influence on the level of Group's operating cost and its financial results.
 Risk of losing key employees
The Group's success is dependent on the involvement and qualifications of its key employees who contributed immensely to Group's development and effective optimization of the Group's operating processes. Due to the market competition for highly qualified specialists there is no guarantee the Group will be able to preserve all valuable employees.
 The risk of collective dispute
On December 12, 2011 an Inter-union trade organization NSZZ Soldarnosc AGORA S.A i INFORADIO SP. Z O.O. ("OM") was created. The trade unions operate in Agora S.A., Inforadio Sp. z o.o. and Poligrafia Sp. z o.o. According to the law requirements the managment boards of the companies in which trade unions operate consult or negotiate with them decisions in legally determined cases. The Group tries to maintain good relations with its employees and solve any problems as they appear, however it can not be excluded that in the future the Group may experience a collective dispute in law determined cases.
13. FACTORS AND UNUSUAL EVENTS WHICH HAD INFLUENCE ON THE RESULTS OF BUSINNESS ACTIVITIES FOR 2011 WITH THE ESTIMATION OF THEIR INFLUENCE
A negative impact on the Group Agora in 2011 have had annual impairment tests. As a result of verification of the financial projections of the business segments of the Agora Group, the Group recognized an impairment loss in the total amount of PLN 14.3 million. This amount consists of impairment losses on several magazine titles in the Magazine segment and the value of property, plant and equipment in a one of cinemas from the Helios network.
Moreover, further limitation of ad expenditure in press affected dailies and magazines. It has had a negative impact on the Group's results as 57.2% of the Group's total revenues came from advertising. A negative factor influencing the Group's revenues has been also the worldwide trend of declining copy sales which affected Gazeta Wyborcza and magazines published by Agora.
14. DIVISIONS OF THE COMPANY AND OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES
Agora S.A. has 19 divisions and the major headquarter in Warsaw. Other companies from the Group do not have divisions.
15. THE MANAGEMENT BOARD'S STATEMENT OF THE REALIZATION OF FORECASTS
The Management Board did not publish any forecasts of the Company's financial results and because of that this report does not present any Management Board's statement of the realization of them, as well as any differences between actual and forecasted financial results.
16. ISSUING OF SECURITIES
In 2011 the Company did not issue any securities.

These activities constitute a part of segments' or brands' development within the Agora Group. The most important information regarding these projects can be found on the Company's website. Actions undertaken by Agora's media are of serial or ad hoc nature as an answer to a specific social problem or event.

Moreover, Agora's media promote spending free time in an active way, for example by means of the action Polska biega (Poland runs) or Polska na rowery (Poland on bikes). Our media also try to shape civil attitudes encouraging Poles to participate in elections within their own authorial actions or as patrons of actions organized by other entities, for example, Kobiety na wybory (Women go to vote) or Wybory dla wszystkich (Elections for everyone). Agora's media draw also attention to problems in different parts of the world and initiate actions supporting them. The example include actions undertaken in 2011 on the website Podarnik.Gazeta.pl for the inhabitants of Libia and Japan and the action undertaken by Sport.pl supporting activities of Polish Humanitarian Action called Movement for Africa.
As far as the recommendation concerning the due care for the quality of reporting practice by means of communication expressed on the Company's corporate website with regard to untrue of partially untrue information on the Company, the Management Board of Agora S.A. shall make a decision to take their position in each case separately.

Despite legally required information Agora's corporate website offers basic corporate documents as its Statute and by-laws of its governing and supervising bodies. Additionally, the website presents the professional biographies of the members of the Management Board or Supervisory Board. According to the requirements the Company publishes on its website financial statements and regulatory filings. Additionally, to facilitate the analyses of the financial information, the Company provides PowerPoint presentations with the financial results and audio recordings from the teleconferences during which members of the Management Board discussed the Group's financial results in a given period of time.
According to the requirements, on the website one can find also the part dedicated to general meetings of shareholders, which traditionally take place in the Company's headquarters in Warsaw. On the website, one can find all the documents relating to a general meeting of shareholders, including announcement on convening the general meeting, the candidates to the managing or supervising bodies together with their professional biographies as soon as the Company receives them from the entitled entities. Here, one can also find all organizational information as a break in general meeting of shareholders or changes in the agenda of the meeting.
On June 22, 2011 the General Meeting of Shareholders of Agora S.A. took place in its headquaters in Warsaw and all the documents relating to that Meeting were published on the Company's website. The General Meeting was convened by the Management Board of Agora S.A. Its course took place in accordance with Commercial Companies Code and the By-laws of General Meeting. The Members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board as well as the representatives of the Company's Auditor were present during the General Meeting of Shareholders and were ready to answer all the questions according to their competencies and law.
In case of questions from shareholders and answers to those questions during the general meeting of shareholders they are available for everyone due to the fact that the Company records the meetings of shareholders. Additionally, the Company prepares the list of questions and answers relating to a given meeting of shareholders if they appear. The answers are given by the Management Board and Supervisory Board members present during the meeting.
Here, one can also find the documents relating to the dividend, for example the Management Board recommendation on profit distribution, draft resolutions and final resolutions.
The Company publishes on its website reports relating to its compliance with corporate governance rules and information relating to the rule on changing the auditor examining the Group's financial statements. The Company, every year, in its quarterly report published on its website provides information on the cost of motivation plans in the Company (including the one based on the Company's shares).
In the section relating to the Supervisory Board, the Company provides information on one member of the Supervisory Board related to the shareholder entitled to more than 5% of votes during general meeting of shareholders. Here one can find the Supervisory Board reports together with the evaluation of the Company's internal risk control system and risk management system.
III. BEST PRACTICE FOR SUPERVISORY BOARD MEMBERS
The Supervisory Board of Agora S.A. complies with all the requirements of the corporate governance rules.
As part of its duties the Supervisory Board prepares the concise evaluation of the Company together with the evaluation of internal control system and risk management system. This evaluation is published on the corporate website together with all the documents relating to general meeting of shareholders.
Additionally, the Supervisory Board examines and gives its opinion on all issues being the subject of the general meeting of shareholders. The representatives of the Supervisory Board participate in the general meeting in the composition enabling them answering possible questions voiced by shareholders. In 2011, the Supervisory Board was represented by its President Mr. Andrzej Szlzak.
In case of relation between a Supervisory Board member and the shareholder entitled to more than 5% of votes during the general meeting of shareholders this person informs about that fact the Management Board of the Company and other members of the Supervisory Board. Similar situation takes place in case of conflict of interests or possibility that such a conflict of interests may arise.

In 2011 none of the members of the Supervisory Board resigned from his or her function. As far as independence of the Supervisory Board members is concerned it is discussed in detail in further part of the report.
IV. BEST PRACTICE OF SHAREHOLDERS
Agora S.A., as a public company, allows the representatives of media to participate in its general meeting of shareholders. Also, during the last General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2011, the representatives of media were invited to participate. In case the Company plans to introduce the changes in the by-laws of general meeting of shareholders it tries to inform about it in advance to make it possible for shareholders to execute their rights.
During the General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2011 there were no changes introduced in the by- laws of the general meeting. In 2011 the general meeting did not resolve on share issue. The resolution on profit distribution provided for the compliance with the term ­ of no longer than 15 working days between the date setting the right to dividend and the day of dividend payment. The General Meeting did not resolve on conditional dividend or division of nominal value of the Company's shares.
Each year, the Company provides real-life broadcast of the general meeting of shareholders in Polish and in English. During the General Meeting of Shareholders held in 2011, the Company did not provide the shareholders with the possibility of bilateral communication by electronic communication means where shareholders could have taken the floor during the Meeting from a location other than the General Meeting or could have exercised their voting right either in person or through a proxy, inter alia, due to safety reasons. The Company will analyse the possibility to comply with this requirement in 2013 provided that the available software shall gurantee safety of the general meeting and its efficient course taking into account the dispersed nature of the Company's shareholder base.
