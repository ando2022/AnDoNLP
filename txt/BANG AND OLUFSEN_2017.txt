LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
In 2016/17, the Group continued the double-digit growth, improved profitability and generated a positive free cash flow. The result was
driven by the launch of new and innovative products, new brand partnerships and the continued implementation of a stronger, more agile operating model.

Improved financial result with satisfactory growth The Group showed healthy revenue growth for the third year in a row. In line with guidance, revenue increased by a satisfactory 12 per cent driven by a strong momentum in the B&O PLAY business unit (27 per cent growth), and moderate growth in the Bang & Olufsen business unit (3 per cent).
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and capitalisation (EBITDAC) were DKK 25 million compared to negative DKK 106 million last year. EBITDAC for the underlying business was DKK 81 million or 2.7 per cent of the Group's total revenue compared to DKK 14 million last year, corresponding to an improvement of DKK 67 million. This was in line with expectations and shows that the initiatives to adapt the operating model combined with the growth of B&O PLAY and the brand partnering business are on track.
Free cash flow for the year improved significantly from negative DKK 187 million last year to DKK 307 million and to DKK 98 million adjusted for the sale of the Czech subsidiary and the escrow payment from HARMAN. This improvement is an important milestone in transforming the company to positive cash generation.

Focus on the core capabilities In March 2017, the Group announced the divestiture of the assembly facility in the Czech Republic to Tymphany Acoustics Technology. The divestiture allows the Group to further concentrate on its core capabilities design, acoustics, and craftsmanship, and is in line with the strategy of transitioning the company to an agile and asset-light model and leveraging technology partners in areas which are not core to the company.
The Group and Tymphany has had a successful partnership for several years and as part of the transaction, a long-term agreement has been made to ensure stability in the supply of high-quality products. Thereby, the Group will maintain access to the very strong competencies and end-to-end processes built at the Czech site during the last 12 years.
Launch of innovative products 2016/17 saw the launch of several products that were well-received in the market.
The TV portfolio was expanded with two TVs. B eoVision 14 reflects the design, and craftsmanship tradition of Bang & Olufsen with oak wood lamellas that cover the custom-built speakers. Constructed in

black aluminium and with a unique design, BeoVision Horizon can adapt to the different domestic settings with its versatile stand programmes.
Bang & Olufsen also introduced two wireless multiroom speaker systems. BeoSound 1 and BeoSound 2 are both ultra-flexible in terms of usability, connectivity and placement options.
In April, Bang & Olufsen unveiled the BeoSound Shape. The wall-mounted wireless multiroom speaker system is designed as a modular combination of hexagonal shapes that are combined in a customisable wall decoration that blends in with the home interior. The result is a ground-breaking concept and a completely new product category; Sound as Interior. The system will be available in Bang & Olufsen stores in August 2017, and the new concept is expected to be an important driver of revenue and brand awareness in the coming years.
The B&O PLAY portfolio was expanded with seven new products during the year, and several new features and colours for the existing products were also introduced. Key launches included the very popular Beoplay H5 wireless earphones, the top-of-the-line Beoplay H9 wireless over-ear headphone, the powerful and wireless Beoplay M5 multiroom speaker and Beoplay P2, which is the smallest and most intelligent member of the B&O PLAY range of wireless Bluetooth speakers.

The global expansion of the B&O PLAY retail network continues. New distribution agreements with large and well-reputed distributors across the world were signed, and especially the North American and Greater China regions saw a significant increase in revenue from B&O PLAY due to the expansion of the retail network.
At the end of May 2017, B&O PLAY had increased the number of third-party retail stores to 6,424 from 5,692 stores at the end of last year. Furthermore, sales per store continued to increase, driven by higher brand awareness, stronger in-store merchandising and a high launch pace of innovative products.
Leaner organisation The Group's focus on core activities and creating a more agile and asset-light model resulted in a decrease in the number of full-time employees. At the end of the financial year, Bang & Olufsen had 1,169 full time employees worldwide compared to 1,734 at the end of the previous financial year. This was mainly impacted by the divestiture of the assembly facility in the Czech Republic in May 2017.
Engaged employees represent an essential part of driving growth and improved profitability going forward, and the work to improve competencies and processes continued along with the strengthening of general management capabilities.

Optimising retail network During the year, the company continued the work of creating a retail network of fewer but stronger retail partners. New partners were attracted to key markets, while the overall number of B1 and shop-in-shop stores was reduced by 31.
Strengthening the customer experience in the Bang & Olufsen branded distribution has been a priority and the company has worked with the network of retailers on training, best practice sharing and improving the sales process, among other things.

New members of the Board and new CEO of B&O PLAY Changes were made to the Board of Directors and Executive Management Board during the year. At the Annual General Meeting in September, Juha Christensen and Ivan Tong Kai Lap joined the Board as new additional members.
In Spring 2017, John Mollanger joined the company as Executive Vice President and CEO of B&O PLAY. John Mollanger has worked across the US, Europe and Asia for leading global sport, lifestyle, and fashion compa-

nies where he gained strong experience in building brands and driving revenue growth.
Dividend policy and capital structure Due to the negative earnings for the year, historical earnings volatility, and the fact that the key strategic initiatives taken over the past years still have to take full effect, the Board of Directors intends to recommend to the General Meeting that no dividend is paid to the shareholders this year.
The Group has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. As the strategy shows sustainable traction and delivers positive earnings, the Board of Directors will define and implement a long-term capital structure, which will lead to a re-consideration of distributing capital and/or dividends to the shareholders.
Continued growth and profitability In 2017/18, the Group aims to maintain the growth momentum and to capitalise on the foundation provided by the asset-light model with increased focus on technology partnerships.

The use of technology partners will allow the Group to further focus on the core capabilities of acoustics, design and craftsmanship and thereby create an even stronger proposition for customers, while improving the profitability of the company. This will be supported by the brand partnerships that are progressing well and driving significant value through licensing fees and increased brand awareness as well as strengthening the channel and distribution setup.

The Board expects that the strategic initiatives and partnerships launched over the recent years will lead to a growth of more than 10 per cent on average per year, and eventually reaching a profitability level of more than 12 per cent EBIT for the underlying business during the coming three-year strategy period. This will further contribute to the continued strengthening of the company and support the ambition of being the leading global audio lifestyle brand.

year was almost on-par with last year, while moderate growth in the fourth quarter resulted in a full-year growth of 3 per cent, which was in line with the guidance of low single-digit growth for the full year.
Revenue generated in the TV category increased moderately compared to last year due to the launch of new TVs in the first half of the year. 29 per cent of the revenue was generated from the TV category compared to 32 per cent in 2015/16.
Revenue in the Audio category accounted for 8 per cent of the revenue compared to 4 per cent in 2015/16. 2016/17 was positively impacted by the launch of the BeoSound 1 and BeoSound 2 wireless speaker systems, which have been very well-received in the market.
The share of revenue from speaker sales was 13 per cent against 19 per cent last year, which was positively impacted by the launch of the BeoLab 90.
The B&O PLAY business unit generated revenue of DKK 1,236 million against DKK 970 million last year corresponding to a growth of 27 per cent. The growth was mainly driven by new and innovative products, especially Beoplay H5, Beoplay H9, Beoplay M5 and Beoplay P2 performed well.

Non-recurring and aperiodic income and costs 2016/17 was impacted by several non-recurring and aperiodic items. The financial year included costs related to the continued adaption of the company's operating model and was therefore impacted by DKK 97 million in non-recurring and aperiodic items.
The impact on gross profit totaled DKK 42 million and were related to write-down of inventories including service stock and retail inventory. This was due to changes in the end-to-end operating model, affecting the company's inventories and service model.
The company's capacity costs were adversely impacted by DKK 86 million, which were mainly related to:
· Restructuring of the Bang & Olufsen business unit done in May 2017 corresponding to DKK 30 million
· In addition, the Group will continue the journey towards fewer company owned and operated stores in all regions. The optimised distribution has resulted in additional costs, impairments of goodwill, and write-down of tangible assets corresponding to a total of DKK 56 million
The DKK 86 million impacted development costs by DKK 23 million, distribution and marketing costs by DKK 53 million and administration costs by DKK 10 million.

In addition, the company had an accounting gain of DKK 31 million related to the sales of the shares in Bang & Olufsen's Czech subsidiary. In total, the non-recurring and aperiodic items amounted to DKK 97 million net in the financial year, compared to DKK 133 million in 2015/16.
Gross margin (All gross margins are underlying business) The Group gross margin was 39.7 per cent against 37.7 per cent last year. Both the Bang & Olufsen and the B&O PLAY business unit gross margins improved compared to last year.
The gross margin for the Bang & Olufsen business unit was 42.4 per cent against 40.9 per cent in the previous financial year. The margin was positively impacted by income from brand partnerships, while exchange rates and a change in product mix with a higher share of turnover from the connected audio category adversely impacted the margin.
The gross margin for the B&O PLAY business unit was 35.7 per cent against 32.2 per cent last year. The sig-

nificant improvement in gross margin was driven by

higher volumes, positive scalability impacts on the sup-

ply chain, and improved product margins.

Distribution and marketing costs were DKK 725 million c0ompared to DKK 717 million last year. This cor-
responds to an increase of DKK 8 million that was a
result of reclassification of cost to administration costs,
continued investment in marketing and distribution in
B&O PLAY and lower costs in Bang & Olufsen.

Administration costs amounted to DKK 98 million against DKK 79 million last year. The increase is primarily due to reclassification of costs from distribution and marketing to administration.

Development costs recognised as an expense (incl. amortisation and impairment losses) were DKK 386 million against DKK 315 million last year. The increase was mainly due to higher depreciation of the current TV product portfolio.

The capitalised development costs were DKK 174 million compared to DKK 152 million last year, corresponding to a capitalisation rate of 48.1 per cent compared to 50.3 per cent last year.

Total amortisation charges and impairment losses on development projects were DKK 222 million compared to DKK 165 million last year.

MARKET DEVELOPMENT
In 2016/17, the Greater China and North American regions were the main revenue growth drivers. The growth was primarily driven by B&O PLAY
products, which performed well through existing and new retailers.

Distribution development During 2016/17, the Group continued the work to attract new, high potential retail partners to create a stronger and more profitable network of stores. In total, 50 new B1-stores and shop-in-shops were opened or upgraded, while 81 low performing stores primarily in Europe and Rest of World were closed or changed to shop-in-shops. This was in line with the Group's ambition of improving the overall quality and financial health of the retail network. Thus, the number of B1 stores and shop-in-shops was 626 at the end of 2016/17 compared to 657 last year.
Strengthening the customer experience in the Bang & Olufsen branded distribution remained a focus area. Initiatives included working with the current network of retailers on increased training, best practice sharing, improving the sales process and in-store demonstrations, retail standards and visual merchandising.

currently with the expansion of the retail network, B&O PLAY focused on improving the sales per store and like-for-like growth, driven by increased brand awareness, stronger in-store merchandising and high launch pace of new innovative products, while continuously adapting the distribution to reflect the performance of the stores.
At the end of May 2017, B&O PLAY had increased the number of third-party retail stores to 6,424 from 5,692 stores last year. The increase was mainly realised in Europe and in the Greater China region, while distribution through a few low performing telecom operator retail chains were closed.
Furthermore, the development of the B&O PLAY ecommerce platform continued, thereby making it easier and more convenient for new and existing customers to shop B&O PLAY products online.

Global expansion of the B&O PLAY retail network was another key focus area. The interest from third-party retailers to market B&O PLAY products continued, and during the year new distribution agreements were signed with large distributors across the world. Con-

Revenue development by region Revenue in the European region increased from DKK 1,669 million to DKK 1,681 million, corresponding to a growth of 1 per cent (3 per cent in local currency). B&O PLAY revenue showed growth, while Bang & Olufsen revenue showed a moderate decline.

PRODUCT LAUNCHES
During 2016/17, the Group launched a number of innovative products across the product portfolio that demonstrated the company's core capabilities within
acoustics, design and craftsmanship.

During the year, the company launched a number of products that set new standards across product categories.
While the products launched in 2016/17 build on the company's core capabilities within acoustics, design and craftsmanship, they are also examples of the company's increased cooperation with leading technology partners.
Several launches in the Bang & Olufsen business unit The Bang & Olufsen business unit operates with three categories of products that caters for three main usecases; Flexible Living, Immersive Moments and Sound as Interior.
Flexible Living New products launched in the Flexible Living category include BeoVision Horizon, BeoSound 1 and BeoSound 2; they all cater to the increased demand for more flexible products that are adaptable to different domestic settings.

BeoVision Horizon is a 4k Ultra HD TV and is Bang & Olufsen's entry-level TV model, even though it features classic Bang & Olufsen virtues such as powerful sound and crystal clear images in a sleek, black aluminium design. It is built upon the Android TV platform.
BeoSound 1 and BeoSound 2 are wireless speaker systems that feature 360 degrees of spherical sound and are ultra-flexible in terms of usability, connectivity and placement options. BeoSound 1 and BeoSound 2 also include multiroom functionality making them part of the family of Bang & Olufsen and B&O PLAY products that can play different music in different rooms or let one tune flow throughout the home.
Immersive Moments BeoVision 14 is an example of a new Immersive Moments product; a product that offers the ultimate immersive cinematic experience with the focus on creating the beautifully-designed sound.

powered by the Android TV platform, and comes with integrated Google Cast technology.
Sound as Interior Today, there is a growing expectation that technology does not always have to look like technology and that it should integrate seamlessly into modern life. With the unveiling of the new BeoSound Shape in April, Bang & Olufsen redefined the future of sound and introduced a new product category; Sound as Interior.
Blending in with the home interior, this new wireless speaker system is designed as a modular combination of hexagonal shapes that are combined in a wall decoration, which can be placed on the wall in every imaginable size and pattern. It consists of a combination of speakers, amplifiers and sound absorbing tiles that contributes to the improvement of the indoor acoustic even when switched off.
Hidden behind a hexagonal tile, the BeoSound Core connectivity hub of course enables wireless streaming of high quality music from mobile devices via streaming technologies such as AirPlay, Chromecast or Bluetooth. In addition, it easily connects with other Bang & Olufsen and B&O PLAY products through B eoLink Multiroom.
New and innovative B&O PLAY products The B&O PLAY business unit operates with three categories of products that caters for three main use cases; personal on-the-go, social on-the-go and flexible living.
Personal on-the-go The headphones category was expanded with the launches of the wireless headphones Beoplay H9 and

Beoplay H4. Beoplay H9 is a top-of-the-line wireless over-ear headphone that combines craftsmanship and comfort with flagship noise cancelling performance, while Beoplay H4 is a new archetype within the wireless headphone segment in a clean and contemporary design with an emphasis on pure materials, pure design and pure sound.
Beoplay H5 is the Group's first wireless earphones. It comes with a magnet built into each earpiece, so users can click them around their neck. Clicking the earpieces together, Beoplay H5 automatically powers down, saving battery life.
Social on-the-go Beoplay P2, the smallest and most intelligent member of the range of wireless Bluetooth speakers, was launched in April. All switches and buttons have been removed for a simple and magical user experience that can be customised in the Beoplay App. With just a double tap or shake, the user can play, pause and skip track.
Flexible living The connected audio category was extended with the launch of a new standalone speaker, Beoplay M5. The speaker top is a disc made from crafted aluminium. Pressing the disc gently downwards will play or pause the speaker, and using the same gesture with an inactive Beoplay M5 will make it join other music experiences going on in the home. This category is a key focus area expected to drive growth for B&O PLAY in the coming years.

Analyst coverage The following brokers covered the Bang & Olufsen share at the end of the financial year:
· Danske Markets Equities · Nordea Markets · SEB · Sydbank
Dividend The positive cash flow in 2016/17 as well as the significant proceeds from the Automotive transaction in 2015 means that the company has a positive cash position. During 2016/17, the company's financial performance has improved, but continues to be vulnerable, and key strategic initiatives taken over the past years, such as the Automotive partnership with HARMAN International Industries Limited and the technology partnership with LG Electronics, still have to take full effect. Therefore, the Board of Directors intends to recommend to the Annual General Meeting that no dividend is paid to the shareholders.

STRATEGY
Bang & Olufsen wants to become the leading global audio lifestyle brand by delivering new, innovative products for clearlydefined consumer segments. Based on an agile business model
with focus on the company's core capabilities and a customercentric approach, Bang & Olufsen will continue its transformation
to maintain the growth momentum, increase profitability and lower the risk over the next three years.

Becoming the leading global audio lifestyle brand In recent years, Bang & Olufsen has taken significant steps to create a solid foundation for the future. The business has been focused on key consumer segments through the Bang & Olufsen and B&O PLAY business units, and non-core activities have been divested. The operating model has been transformed to leverage technology partnerships in areas that are not core to the company.
This approach has had a positive impact and the company has delivered double-digit growth and a substantial improvement of profitability, primarily driven by the B&O PLAY business unit as well as through brand partnerships.
Over the next three years the company will further utilise the opportunities that the new foundation provides and maintain the growth momentum. This will be done by developing the brand and the brand partnership business, focusing on the company's core capabilities, improving the channel and distribution setup and increase market penetration especially in China and the US. All with the goal of realising the ambition to become the leading global audio lifestyle brand.

The continued growth, improved earnings and adapted business model, will result in a significant strengthening of cash flow generation as well as lower the general risk profile of the company.
A more agile business model In the last couple of years, substantial changes have been instigated to adapt the company's operating model towards an agile and asset-light model to reduce complexity, increase flexibility and to scale the business.
Today, the company is in a strong position to cater to the rapidly changing technological environment, where emerging platform ecosystems are re-defining the industry and shaping products. This provides a unique opportunity for the company to focus on the core capabilities of acoustics, design and craftsmanship.
These capabilities will be increasingly relevant as the key differentiating factors towards the company's target groups. Moreover, demands for individualisation and customisation as well as a desire to live progressive lives will dominate their choice of buying, rather than choices between technologies.

In this strategy period, the company will continue its transformation, while materialising benefits of the initiatives that have already been implemented, such as the technology partnership related to TV as well as the sale of the assembly facilities.
Developing the brand and brand partnerships The Bang & Olufsen brand remains very strong but it is important that the brand equity is further developed and strengthened to realise its full potential.
Over the past five years, the company has successfully grown the sales of products in the B&O PLAY business unit, building on the company's core capabilities of acoustics, design and craftsmanship. Bang & Olufsen and B&O PLAY operate as separate business units, but support one common brand equity.
This diversified business model will also be key going forward, however the company will develop a closer and more consistent connection between the two units. A unified execution will ensure a more impactful marketing approach and facilitate a more consistent customer experience.
In recent years the company has entered brand partnerships with some of the largest and most innovative companies in the world. Brand partnering has become a key part of the business and a platform for exposing potential customers to the brand and the key capabilities of Bang & Olufsen. Going forward, brand partnering will be an even more integrated part of the company's strategy to drive revenue, profitability, and increase brand awareness.
Innovation based on core capabilities The company's future innovation will be focused on the core capabilities of acoustics, design and craftmanship, supplemented by collaborations with technology partners, who are leading in their field of expertise.
This will enable Bang & Olufsen to further develop the core capabilities, while having the freedom and flexibil-

ity to adapt to the rapidly changing technology trends and customer demands across business units.
The B&O PLAY business unit will continue its strong growth by creating and selling products for the premium mass market. The target group is interested in design and acoustics, and are willing to pay a premium price. B&O PLAY will continue to leverage on the strong heritage of the company and develop within the product categories and segments that are already established in the market and are showing strong growth.
The products in the B&O PLAY business unit will be developed to cater for three main use-cases:
· Personal on-the-go: The music experience is personal and part of the consumers everyday life onthe-go, while travelling or when commuting.
· Social on-the-go: The consumer who shares music with others to bring people together and shape memories. The music experience is a social happening.
· Flexible Living: Consumers who expect more flexible products that can adapt to the rhythm of everyday life and different domestic settings. All in a consistent and connected portfolio of products.
B&O PLAY will continue to strive to be among the leading players in the above-mentioned categories in terms of design and performance and will build on industry standard platforms. With the fast-evolving categories and continuously changing technology, B&O PLAY will remain agile and flexible, and continue to monitor and explore adjacent categories, where the core competences can support a relevant customer proposition.
The Bang & Olufsen business unit will grow by bringing new innovative products to market that are relevant and appealing to the key target group. Focus will continue to be on developing progressive products with beautiful design and high-quality acoustic based on our core capabilities.

The products in the Bang & Olufsen business unit will be developed to cater for three main use-cases;
· Flexible Living: The consumer who wants flexible products that can adapt to their everyday life and different domestic settings. The products will be best in class in terms of design and performance, and offer freedom of placement and build on the connected audio industry standards.
· Immersive Moments: The consumer that gathers families and friends and commands their attention in the immersive experience. The products will deliver the ultimate cinematic experience with the focus being on creating the beautifully designed sound, based on the company's leading capabilities within audio and acoustics.
· Sound as Interior: The consumer that wants technology that does not look like technology ­ and in form and function will integrate seamlessly into their lives. The products will break industry standards and redefine and design the future of sound, while blending in with the home interior.
The product portfolio in the Bang & Olufsen business unit has been simplified, and the new products launched will generally be simpler to install and service compared to the current product portfolio. Across all product categories, open platforms will be used to ensure industry standard compatibility and fast and agile development and to cater to the demands of the consumer market.
Strengthening distribution and channels The future distribution will maximise the sales potential for the products in the portfolio by reaching the target audience where they shop now and in the future, while ensuring an excellent customer experience. In addition, the distribution model must be attractive and sustainably profitable for the retail partners to attract and retain the right partners.

and brand positioning of the company. However, to supplement this, the distribution will be broadened ensuring more products are distributed through other channels. These will be both online and physical channels and will complement each other.
The branded distribution caters to those who are familiar with the brand, and to new customers who will experience a prime execution of the brand. Distribution through partner-branded channels serve the purpose of reaching a greater number of potential customers and thereby drive revenue and support the amplification of the brand.
The transformation of the B1 and shop-in-shop distribution will continue; creating a distribution setup with fewer, stronger partners that can deliver a strong customer experience and have enough scale in the operations to drive a professional retail business.
The third-party retail distribution will continue to be developed. Focus will be to expand the overall presence through the number of stores, while ensuring that the sale of existing stores is developed and the channel will be broadened into lifestyle.
An important driver of brand perception is the digital engagement with customers. Therefore, Bang & Olufsen will create a stronger and more consistent digital profile across all touchpoints to ensure that the interaction supports the brand position and creates a closer relationship with customers. Increased digital interaction will also lead to a deeper understanding of customers and their needs and ensure a real-time and more contextual engagement with them.
Realising growth potential in China and the US Despite high growth rates in recent years, the brand awareness and market penetration of Bang & Olufsen remains low in markets such as China and the US.

The B1 and shop-in-shop distribution is expected to continue to play an essential role in the overall sales

To materialise the potential of these key growth markets, the company will focus and strengthen the local

organisations and resources will be prioritised towards the expansion of B&O PLAY.
Brand partnerships will be leveraged and will play an important role in increasing brand awareness and amplifying the core capabilities of the company. In both China and the US the operational setup will be adjusted to a more scalable model, ensuring that the future growth is profitable.
The sales potential of products for the Bang & Olufsen business unit will be materialised through retail partners that have deep understanding of the local markets and the size and scale to run a profitable business and deliver an excellent customer experience.

The continued growth momentum, combined with the initiatives taken to change the operating model and the increased income from the brand partnering business will ensure a profitability level of more than 12 per cent EBIT margin will be achieved before the end of the current strategy period that expires in May 2020.

As the company's operating model limits the amount of capital needed to drive the growth momentum, the free cash flow generation is expected to significantly increase in the future and to reach a level of more than 10 per cent of group revenue before May 2020.

The Board of Directors believes that members should be chosen for their overall competences, and also recognises the benefits of a diverse board in respect of experience, culture and gender.
In 2015, the Board of Directors set a target for female representation according to which the company's goal is to have two female members of the Board of Directors elected by the General Meeting by 2018. There is currently one female member in the Board of Directors and 3 members who are non-local. Since the new target was set, the board has been extended with two male candidates, one proposed by a major shareholder and the other proposed by the board based on his specific skills within technology. No further women have been elected to the Board of Directors since the new target was set.
In 2017, the company reached its goal of having not less than 15 per cent female members at senior management level. The share of women in senior management in the Bang & Olufsen Group increased from 10 per cent on 31 May 2016 to 15.7 per cent on 31 May 2017. Senior management is defined as the Executive Management Board and the Director+ group. The total number of employees in this group at the end of May 2017 was 38 employees.

For further information about the Board of Directors refer to the section `Board of Directors' on pages 3435.

The Board of Directors has set out a policy to increase the proportion of women in senior management where the relevant action points are as follows:

Diversity The Board of Directors believes that diversity in general, including diversity of gender, culture, nationality and competencies strengthens the way a company operates. In April 2013, the Board of Directors adjusted the company's objectives for the diversity of the members of the Board of Directors elected by the General Meeting in relation to gender in order to comply with new Danish legislation of objectives to increase the proportion of the underrepresented gender on the Board of Directors.

· Secure at least one female candidate for vacancies arising in senior management
· Ensuring an appropriate level of female participants in the Bang & Olufsen talent programme
As the goal for 2017 was reached, a new target for the share of women in senior management in the Bang & Olufsen Group has been set. The goal is hereafter to have not less than 25 per cent female members at Director+ level by May 2020.

rectors. Employees are entitled to elect the equivalent of half the board members elected by the Annual General Meeting, albeit not less than two members.
Employees have chosen to elect board members on group level, which means that only representatives on the Board of Directors of the parent company, Bang & Olufsen a/s are elected. The employees have, therefore, elected three colleagues to the main Board of Directors.
The latest election of employees to the Board of Directors took place in June 2015 by means of a written, secret and direct vote. Employee-elected board members are elected for a four-year period and eligible employees are those who are of age and who on the election day have been employed by the Company for at least 12 months. The three Employee-elected board members which were elected at the election in June 2015 joined the Board of Director's after the Annual General Meeting in September 2015.
Should an Employee-elected board member's employment be terminated, the employee in question will retire from the Board of Directors and be replaced by an elected substitute. An employee-elected board member has the same rights, obligations and responsibilities as the other board members.
Remuneration Remuneration is based on responsibilities, competencies and performance and is designed to be competitive and in line with market practice of comparable listed companies.
Bang & Olufsen's remuneration policy is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and the Board and the overall objective of the Remuneration Policy is to attract, motivate and retain qualified members of the Board and the Executive Management Board as well as to align the interests of the Board and the

Executive Management Board with the interests of the company's shareholders.
The remuneration of the Board and the Executive Management Board shall be designed to support the strategic goals of Bang & Olufsen and to promote value creation for the benefit of the shareholders of Bang & Olufsen. Finally, the remuneration levels shall ensure that the company is able to attract and retain highlyqualified members for both its Executive Management Board and Board of Directors.
Executive Management Board The remuneration of the Executive Management Board and Board of Directors is assessed annually. The Board of Directors decides on the remuneration of the Executive Management Board and other key employees based on a recommendation from the Remuneration Committee of the Board.
Members of the Executive Management Board receive an annual base in line with market practice and based on the individual member's responsibilities and performance. Further, they are entitled to customary non-monetary benefits such as company car, insurance, newspaper, telephony and internet access.
The Annual General Meeting has adopted "General guidelines concerning incentive-based remuneration" pursuant to which members of the Management Board and other key employees, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, can be offered to participate in a Matching Shares Programme.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The high-end consumer electronics industry is an industry characterised by factors such as disruptive innovation, ever-changing consumer
demands and intense competition. To navigate and be successful in such an industry, Bang & Olufsen considers it an important factor to have a strong risk management setup allowing the company to identify and mitigate key risks in a systematic and proactive way.

INTRODUCTION
Today, Bang & Olufsen faces intense competition in an ever-changing and intricate global market, where technological trends and potentially disruptive innovation might entail a risk to the company's product offering and portfolio. In this setting, remaining top of mind in consumers' preferences is key to ensure brand awareness and a clear position in the midst of the myriad of competing brands in the market.
With this backdrop, ensuring strong and holistic risk management is an essential pillar in navigating within the complex business context and in understanding the company's risk exposure and impact across the global value chain. Bang & Olufsen started in 2015/16 to further strengthen the risk management setup and internal capabilities and in 2016/17, it still remains a high priority within the organisation enabled by an ongoing focus on implementing and promoting a risk management approach encompassing all business operations. The approach to risk management provides the company with a methodology, a framework and a system for identifying, assessing and mitigating significant financial and non-financial risks in a proactive and valuecreating manner. The objective of risk management

therefore is to build on the company's existing practices in order to further embed risk-informed decisionmaking across the Bang & Olufsen organisation.
At Bang & Olufsen, a risk is defined as an event or a development that can prevent the achievement of the company's financial targets, the execution of the company's strategy or the maintenance of the company's license to operate and the brand reputation. The identified risks are divided into three main categories: strategic risks, operational risks and financial risks. The risk management system in Bang & Olufsen is designed to balance risk and reward throughout the company's operations in alignment with the established risk appetite to generate the most value for shareholders and other stakeholders alike.
Key developments and performed activities in 2016/17 In addition to the ongoing risk management within Bang & Olufsen's daily business operations, a number of targeted risk management activities has been performed in the last year to meet the company's ambition and the established objectives for risk management. This entails that Bang & Olufsen in 2016/17 has focused on further development of the risk management capabilities, including the development of a formalised risk

BANG & OLUFSEN A/S

ANNUAL REPORT 2016/17·42

KEY FIGURES·MANAGEMENT REPORT·STRATEGY & OUTLOOK·GOVERNANCE·ANNUAL ACCOUNTS·STATEMENTS BOARD OF DIRECTORS & EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT BOARD·CORPORATE GOVERNANCE·RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

management framework, policy and employee guideline to be upheld in all day-to-day business operations.
Within the last year, the focus has furthermore been on developing a solid governance structure for risk management, including clear roles and responsibilities, which have been assigned to stakeholders across the organisation to ensure that risks are managed at an appropriate level by people who have the mandate and ability to do so.

On a quarterly basis or more frequently if required, Group Management is updated on the development of the risk profile and the progress and effect of the mitigating activities.
IDENTIFIED KEY RISKS
Strategic risks

OVERVIEW OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 2016/17
A risk identification and assessment is conducted on an annual basis to identify and assess risks across Bang & Olufsen's two business units; Bang & Olufsen and B&O PLAY, the company's core business areas and value chain, including; corporate strategy, brand partnering, innovation, product development, sourcing, operations, sales and marketing, IT, human resources and finance.
The risk assessment exercise includes 1) analysis of internal and external information and data 2) a series of interviews with Group Management and other key stakeholders, 3) further analysis and consolidation of the identified risks based on their potential impact and probability, and 4) a validation with Group Management, where the identified risks are validated, analysed and prioritised to establish the company risk profile.
As a part of the risk assessment process, risk ownership of the top strategic risks is assigned to relevant members of Group Management, who will hereafter be responsible for managing the risk in the day-today business operations. For the risks categorised as operational or financial, the risk ownership is assigned to the appropriate owner within the organisation, who through his/her function will be accountable for managing the risk as part of daily operations.

Outsourcing and dependency on suppliers Both the Bang & Olufsen business unit and the PLAY business unit depend on external suppliers for timely delivery of critical materials, components and assembled products, which have to meet the company's high quality standards. To ensure strong partnerships with these suppliers, Bang & Olufsen has a thorough supplier selection process to ensure that the selected suppliers fulfil the requirements from Bang & Olufsen to be a long-term partner. Following the thorough supplier selection processes, the focus is to build long-term partnerships with the selected suppliers. In addition, Bang & Olufsen has a thorough monitoring system in place that verifies the performance of the supplier and provides early warnings of deviations.
To further mitigate this risk, Bang & Olufsen and B&O PLAY, where possible, pursues a dual sourcing strategy aimed at ensuring that the company is able to source the same type of component from at least two different suppliers. For certain unique suppliers, other measures have been implemented to reduce the risk, such as higher inventory buffers and dual sets of production equipment.
Success in strategic partnerships and alliances Meeting customer demands for innovative solutions and foreseeing future technological choices is a risk present for all companies in the electronic consumer industry. However, for Bang & Olufsen, a small volume producer in a market dominated by a few major corporations, the challenge of maintaining its market

BANG & OLUFSEN A/S

ANNUAL REPORT 2016/17·43

KEY FIGURES·MANAGEMENT REPORT·STRATEGY & OUTLOOK·GOVERNANCE·ANNUAL ACCOUNTS·STATEMENTS BOARD OF DIRECTORS & EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT BOARD·CORPORATE GOVERNANCE·RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

position as well as competences in all areas is a constant risk. Bang & Olufsen therefore manages this risk via strategic partnership alliances. However, the use of strategic partners also poses a risk to Bang & Olufsen, as the company is dependent on third-party organisations, e.g. to gain access to product components or as distribution channels. If the strategic partner alliance is discontinued, this could have a significant impact on Bang & Olufsen's ability to supply the market. To manage and mitigate this risk, Bang & Olufsen has ensured that all partnerships and alliances are built on the insurance of strong contractual protection and strong management, which will foster sound corporation as well as clear accountability in the relationship between Bang & Olufsen and the respective third-party organisations.
Distribution channels In selected countries and cities, Bang & Olufsen is currently distributing its products through a network of exclusive Bang & Olufsen franchise stores (i.e. the so-called B1 stores). The performance and success of these franchise takers are important to Bang & Olufsen. Furthermore, the continuous success of this distribution channel relies on the company's ability to attract a sufficient volume of new and suitable franchise takers to sustain expected growth and attract the target customer segment. As such, the risk is related to the franchise takers' ability to invest in the development and maintenance of an attractive and appealing store interior and inventory as well as their ability to set up stores within the right geographical location and their ability to sell Bang & Olufsen's products to the target customers. To manage and mitigate this risk Bang & Olufsen will through a three-year plan continue its focus on building a strong network of franchise stores that can provide customers with the unique in-store Bang & Olufsen customer experiences. Furthermore, the company will continue to focus on launching products in a frequency and of a quality sufficient to attract and maintain the customers' awareness of and pull towards the Bang & Olufsen brand.

Growth in the US and Chinese markets Expanding the company's existing market platform in the US and Chinese markets is a significant opportunity and a key element of the company's business strategy for the coming years. Both within the US and the Chinese market there is substantial growth potential and an attractive opportunity to further expand the brand awareness among its target customers. However both markets are subject to intense competition. Therefor to ensure growth in these markets, the company is working systematically to build its brand presence, e.g. through targeted marketing initiatives, and to develop its distribution network and logistics set-up. In addition to this, the company constantly monitors the market developments and customer preferences to best meet product expectations.
Innovation and disruptions of the TV segment The electronics consumer industry is in a constant flux with the launch of new technologies every month and new consumer trends winning market shares at a staggering speed. As a result, Bang & Olufsen needs to stay on-par with the latest tendencies and developments in order to timely react to possible future industry or product disruptions, especially within the company's TV segment. Thus, the risk entails that the company might be unable to transform its TV segment and product offering to meet increased competition from alternative product offerings, shorter product life cycles, changing market demands and future consumption patterns. To mitigate this risk, Bang & Olufsen has partnered with LG to ensure the ability to maintain and further expand its unique position in TV design and functionality with the purpose of continuing to develop innovative and distinct solutions based on key insights into new consumer preferences and expectations, technological developments and other key trends shaping future customer demands.

Operational risks
Inability to safeguard the company and its products against cyberattacks Bang & Olufsen operates in a business environment, where information technology is becoming increasingly vital to the daily operations and to business decisions. Security breaches in key systems, databases or via phishing emails could potentially lead to business interruption or disclosure of business-critical, confidential data, affecting Bang & Olufsen's competitive position or damaging the company's reputation. With the launch of the new EU data protection regulation, which is to be fully implemented by May 2018, this is an ever more present risk both in terms of handling and securing confidential employee data and customer data. To mitigate these risks Bang & Olufsen actively applies a range of measures, such as technical security tests and controls, various process monitoring controls and internal employee awareness campaigns on IT security, data security and confidentiality, to hereby reduce the risk. In addition to this, the company has initiated a targeted effort within this area to further develop the processes in place and to establish a systematic road map for the work to be conducted in the coming year to ensure increased maturity in the daily management of cyber risks.
Intellectual property rights Within the fast-changing area of consumer electronics, securing and maintaining the company's intellectual property rights is key to sustain the company's brand, its unique design components and its value proposition. With this point of departure, the risk entails that Bang & Olufsen might face intellectual property infringements by competing brands, suppliers or professional counterfeiters. Another potential risk scenario could be that a competitor claims that Bang & Olufsen infringes their intellectual property rights. Both of these risks could lead to a loss of revenue and brand value for Bang & Olufsen. To mitigate this risk, Bang & Olufsen continuously work to uphold strong freedom

to operate analysis management as well as robust intellectual property execution.
Ethics and Compliance Operating in a global context, Bang & Olufsen is faced with various challenges related to ensuring high quality products while maintaining good and ethical business practices. This entails a particular focus on countries where the risk of fraud or corruption might be high. To mitigate this, Bang & Olufsen operates with internal control systems to minimise the risk of staff being involved in illegal or unethical activities. This also entails that employees are encouraged to use the company's whistleblower system if they experience or suspect irregularities of any kind. Furthermore, Bang & Olufsen strives to comply with all international and national legislation, regulation and guidelines within each of the countries, in which the company operates. To manage this risk Bang & Olufsen recognises the UN and ILO declarations on human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption, and through the UN Global Compact the company works to ensure sound and good business operations
Financial risks
Foreign exchange rate risk and credit risk As a result of Bang & Olufsen's global presence, the Group's income statement, balance sheet and equity are exposed to a number of macro-economic and financial risks at any given time.
The main risks are: · Foreign exchange rate risk and · Credit risk related to distribution network
Bang & Olufsen continually assesses these risks at Group level. It is the Group's policy not to speculate in financial risks, hence the financial risk management is solely directed towards hedging these risks in relation to operations and financing.

Bang & Olufsen mainly sources products in US Dollars but sells in a variety of different currencies. Furthermore, the Group has significant administrative costs in Danish Kroner related to the headquarter functions.
It is the Group's practice to hedge a substantial amount of the net cash flow in foreign currency over a 1218 month horizon against the base currency Danish Kroner. The Group actively seeks to achieve hedge account treatment for its foreign exchange hedging programme.
The Group is predominantly exposed to credit risk on trade receivables as well as loans to partners in our distribution network. Our customer base and distribution

network is well diversified with no material concentration risk on any single party or geography. In addition, the Group as a general matter of policy requires business partners to provide security in their business in exchange for granting credit facilities. The Group continuously monitors the framework for credit risk assessment in order to mitigate potential credit risk. In addition, the Group monitors the risk in relation to the specific parties and if required, takes necessary action to minimise the risk of credit losses.
For further information about the Group's management of financial risks, please refer to note 4.3 Financial Instruments in the Group financial statements.

SECTION 1
BASIS OF REPORTING

This section introduces Bang & Olufsen's financial accounting policies in general, as well as an overview of management's key accounting estimates and the new IFRS requirements. All group companies follow the same Group accounting policies. A detailed description of accounting policies related to specific reported amounts is presented in each note to the relevant financial items.
1.1BASIS OF REPORTING
Basic principles The consolidated financial statements of the Bang & Olufsen Group and the financial statements for 2015/16 for Bang & Olufsen a/s have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish requirements for the presentation of financial statements for listed companies (class D entities) cf. the Statutory Order on Adoption of IFRS (the Danish announcement on Adoption of IFRS) issued in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
The consolidated and the separate financial statements are presented in DKK, which is the presentation currency for the Group and the functional currency for the parent company.
Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits resulting from a past event will flow to the Group. Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that the Group will give up future economic benefits as a consequence of a legal or constructive obligation resulting from a past event. The value of the assets and liabilities should be able to be measured reliably.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivatives, which are measured at fair value.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company, Bang & Olufsen a/s, and the companies (subsidiaries), which are controlled by the parent company. The parent company is presumed to have control when it directly or indirectly holds more than 50 per cent of the voting rights or in other ways can exercise or is exercising controlling influence.
Companies in which the Group directly or indirectly holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights and has a significant influence but not control are regarded as associates.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by adding uniform items. The financial statements that are used for the consolidation are prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting principles. In the process of consolidation, intra-group income and expenses, intra-group accounts receivable, and payable and dividend, profits and losses from transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated. In the consolidated financial statements the subsidiaries' items are recognised 100 per cent.
Translation of foreign currency On initial recognition, transactions in a currency other than the company's functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currency that have not been settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at this date. Currency gains and losses arising between the transaction date and the date of payment or the balance sheet date, respectively, are recognised in the profit and loss account as financial income or financial costs. Tangible and intangible non-current

SECTION 1
BASIS OF REPORTING
assets, inventories and other non-monetary assets that have been purchased in a foreign currency and that are measured at historical cost prices are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date.
When recognising companies that present their financial statements in another functional currency than Danish kroner (DKK) in the consolidated financial statements, profit and loss accounts are translated using average exchange rates for the year. The balance sheet items are translated using the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Goodwill is regarded as belonging to the acquired company and is translated using the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Translation differences arising from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries' balance sheet items at the beginning of the year to the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, and from the translation of the profit and loss accounts from average exchange rates to the balance sheet date exchange rates, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Similarly, translation differences that arise on changes made directly to the foreign company's equity are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Investments in associates Investments in associates are recognised and measured according to the equity method in the consolidated financial statements, i.e. at the proportional share of the accounting net asset value of the companies, in accordance with the Group's accounting principles with the deduction or addition of proportional intra-group gains and losses and with the addition of a carrying amount of goodwill.
The proportional share of the companies result after tax with the reduction of any impairment losses on goodwill is recognised in the income statement.
Investments in associates with a negative net asset value are measured at DKK 0. Receivables and other non-current financial assets that are regarded as being part of the total investment in the associate are written down by the remaining negative net asset value. Trade receivables and other receivables are written down to the extent they are assessed to be irrecoverable.
A provision to cover the remaining negative net asset value is recognised only to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover the obligations of the company in question.
New investments in associates are accounted for by using the acquisition method.
Production costs Production costs comprise wages, consumption of stock and indirect costs, (including salaries, depreciation/amortisation and impairment losses) that are incurred with the purpose of achieving the net turnover for the year.
Distribution and marketing costs Distribution and marketing costs comprise costs relating to sales and distribution of the Group's products. These include salaries for sales personnel, advertising and exhibition costs, depreciation/amortisation and impairment losses. Costs in subsidiaries, which are responsible exclusively for the sale of the Group's products, are also allocated to distribution and marketing costs.

Administration costs etc. Administration costs etc. comprise costs for the administrative personnel, management, office costs, depreciation/ amortisation and impairment losses.
Other operating income and other operating expenses Other operating income and other operating expenses comprise income and expenses of a secondary nature relative to the principal activities of the Bang & Olufsen a/s Group.
Adoption of new or amended IFRS Bang & Olufsen has adopted all new, amended standards, revised accounting standards, and interpretations (IFRIC) as endorsed by the EU and effective for the financial year 1 June 2016 - 31 May 2017.
Based on an assessment of new or amended and revised accounting standards and interpretations (`IFRS') issued by IASB and IFRS endorsed by the EU effective on or after 1 January 2016, it has been assessed that the application of these new IFRS has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in 2017, and management does not anticipate any significant impact on future periods from the adoption of these new IFRS.
New or amended EU endorsed accounting standards IASB has issued a number of new standards, amendments to existing standards and bases for conclusions that have not yet come into force, but which will become effective in financial years after 2017/18. New and revised standards are expected to be implemented on the effective date. The following standards are in general expected to change current accounting regulation most significantly:
·IASB has issued IFRS 9 `Financial Instruments', with effective date 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 is part of the IASB's project to replace IAS 39, and the new standard will substantially change the classification of financial assets and measurement of financial instruments and hedging requirements. The standard is not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.
·IASB has is sued IFRS 15 `Revenue from contracts with customers', with effective date 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 is part of the convergence project with FASB to replace IAS 18. The new standard will establish a single, comprehensive framework for revenue recognition. Based on a preliminary assessment, the new standard on revenue recognition is not expected to have a significant effect on recognition and measurement.
·IASB has issued IFRS 16 "Leasing", with effective date 1 January 2019. The change in lease accounting requires capitalisation of the majority of the Group's operational lease contracts. Management has not made a thorough analysis of the effect of the implementation of IFRS 16 "Leases". Based on the operational lease commitment as of 31 May 2017, Bang & Olufsen has a minimum lease obligation of DKK 250 million, corresponding to 9 per cent of the total balance that will be recognised in the Group's assets with a corresponding impact on liabilities.
All other new or amended standards and interpretations, which are not yet effective, are not expected to have any material impact.

1.2CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
When applying the Group's accounting principles, it is necessary that management makes a number of accounting assessments and estimates as well as makes assumptions about the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities and the recognised revenue and costs, which cannot be deduced directly from other sources. Significant judgements are made when assessing provisions, development projects, trade receivables, inventories and deferred tax assets.
Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the given circumstances. The actual outcome can differ from these estimates.
The estimates made and the underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuous basis. Changes made to the accounting estimates are recognised in the financial period, where the change takes place and future financial periods, if the change affects both the period, where the change takes place, and the following financial periods. In 2016/17, new assumption used to determine the value of service stock has been applied cf. note 3.5.1.
The critical accounting estimates and judgements are described under the sections to which they relate.

SECTION 2
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
This section contains notes relating to earnings for the year including operating segments, development and staff costs and taxes for the year. A detailed description of the results for the year is given in the Financial Review on pages 10-15.
2.1OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION
Accounting policies Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised in the income statement, when delivery and transfer of the risks of ownership to the customer has taken place, if the revenue can be measured reliably, and payment is expected to be received. Revenue is recognised net of value added tax and discounts related to the sale. Revenue regarding sales of goods is recognised in the income statement, if the transfer of the risks of ownership to the customer has taken place before the end of the financial year. Licence income and royalties from brand partnerships is recognised in accordance with the agreements and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Bang & Olufsen Group and these benefits can be measured reliably. Segment information Segment information has been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting principles and follows the Group's management structure and the internal management reporting that is used by top operational management to evaluate results and resource allocation. The Group's reportable segments are: ·Bang & Olufsen ·B&O PLAY The segments are split based on differences in products. Bang & Olufsen is made of the core business and sold through Bang & Olufsen's B1 stores and through shop-in-shops. B&O PLAY products are sold through the traditional Bang & Olufsen distribution channels and through third party distribution and e-commerce. License income from brand partnerships is included in the Bang & Olufsen segment. The segment's performance measurement is gross profit. Segment income and costs include the items that can be directly attributed to the individual segment. The segment's asset measurement is a sum consisting of completed development projects, development projects in progress and trade receivables. The internal management reporting does not include segment liabilities. Trade between the Group's reportable segments is carried out at arm's length conditions.

2.5TAXATION
Accounting policies Tax for the year, which includes the current tax and changes in deferred tax for the year, is recognised in profit or loss with the share that is attributable to the result for the year and in other comprehensive income or directly in equity with the share, which can be attributed to entries made in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income tax payable and current income tax receivable is recognised in the balance sheet as the tax calculated on the year's taxable income adjusted for prepaid tax.
When calculating current tax for the year, the tax rates and regulations prevailing at the balance sheet date in the different countries are used.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the tax base and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, except for deferred tax on temporary differences that arise either on initial recognition of goodwill or on initial recognition of a transaction that is not a business combination, and where the temporary difference on initial recognition affects neither accounting profit or loss nor the taxable income.
Deferred tax on temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognised, unless the parent company is able to control when the deferred tax is realised, and it is probable that the deferred tax will not be realised as current tax within the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax is calculated based on the planned use of each asset and settlement of each liability, respectively.
Based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and regulations in the different countries that are expected to prevail when the deferred tax is expected to be realised as current tax. The change in deferred tax due to changes in tax rates or regulations is recognised in profit or loss unless the deferred tax is attributable to transactions that have previously been recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. In the latter case, the change is also recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, respectively.
Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of any tax loss carryforwards, are recognised in the balance sheet at the value of which the asset is expected to be realised either by set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets to be set-off against future positive taxable income. At each balance sheet date, it is assessed if it is probable that sufficient taxable income will exist in the future so that the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
The parent company is jointly taxed with all Danish subsidiaries. The current Danish corporation tax is distributed between the jointly taxed companies in proportion to their taxable income.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Deferred tax assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised either by set-off against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets to be set-off against future positive taxable income. At each balance sheet date, it is assessed if it is probable that sufficient taxable income will exist in the future, so that the deferred tax asset can be utilised. This assessment is based on the details specified in the Strategy section on page 30 in the management review. The deferred tax assets amount to DKK 279.2 million as at 31 May 2017 (DKK 209.0 million as at 31 May 2016).

Deferred tax assets relate to the subsidiaries in Norway, Sweden, Austria, Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, the US, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and the jointly-taxed Danish companies. Deferred tax assets have been calculated based on local tax rates.

"Other" in deferred tax assets includes a tax asset of DKK 27.3 million from deferred income.

In 2016/17, a deferred tax asset of DKK 101.7 million has been recognised in the jointly-taxed Danish companies based on tax loss carryforwards, which can be indefinitely carried forward. This deferred tax as set has been recognised on the basis of Management 's expectations of the Group's long-term earnings up to five years.

In 2016/17, Bang & Olufsen US tax assets of DKK 17.7 million have been capitalised regarding tax losses carried forward. The recognition is based on the expectations to future earnings in Bang & Olufsen US. Unrecognised deferred tax assets amount to DKK 42.3 million. The basis for the unrecnognised deferred tax assets includes tax losses of DKK 120.9 million. The tax losses can be carried forward for a period of 1-20 years.

Deferred tax has been provided for based on local tax rates.

Deferred tax on temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates has not been recognised, since the parent company is able to control when the deferred tax is realised, and it is assessed to be probable that the deferred tax will not be realised as current tax within the foreseeable future.

Recognition
When recognising goodwill, the goodwill amount is allocated to those of the Group's activities that generate independent cash flows (cash-generating units). The definition of cash-generating units is in accordance with the managerial structure and the internal management accounting and reporting in the Group.
Clearly defined and identifiable projects if probable that they can be marketed as new products in a potential market.

Valuation
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as the difference between on the one hand, the cost price of the acquired company, the value of minority interests in the acquired company and the acquisition date fair value of previously held equity interests, and, on the other hand, the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Measured at cost price. This comprises costs, including salaries and depreciation/amortisation that relate directly to the development projects, and which are necessary to complete the project from the time when the development project initially meets the criteria for recognition as an asset. Reimbursements and grants are deducted from the cost price.
Measured at cost price less a ccumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

3.1INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Development costs are capitalised only after technical and commercial feasibility of the projects have been established. In connection with the capitalisation of development costs, the expected useful life of the product is to be determined. Management has assessed that the amortisation period is usually two to six years. Management also makes assumptions when assessing the possible impairment of development projects. The applied principles are unchanged from the 2015/16 financial year. Development projects amount to DKK 334.8 million as at 31 May 2017 (DKK 382.8 million as at 31 May 2016). The main additions in the 2016/17 financial year are development projects relating to TV including the platform and speakers.
Impairment The carrying amount of intangible non-current assets with a definite useful life is reviewed at the balance sheet date to determine if there are indications of decreases in value. If this is the case, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined to assess the need for recognition of any impairment loss.
For development projects in progress and goodwill the recoverable amount is determined at least once a year whether or not there are indications of impairment.
If the asset does not generate cash flows independently of other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest cash-generating unit that includes the asset.
The recoverable amount is determined as the highest value of the asset's or the cash-generating unit's fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. When the value in use is determined, the estimated future cash flows are discounted at their present value using a discount rate that reflects both the present market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks that are connected with the asset and the cash-generating unit, respectively, for which no adjustment has been made in the estimated future cash flows.
If the asset's or the cash-generating unit's recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. For cash-generating units the impairment loss is allocated to reduce first any goodwill amounts and then a remaining impairment loss is allocated to the other assets of the unit, in a way so that no asset is reduced to a value below its fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. On any subsequent reversals of impairment losses recognised in prior periods due to changes in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount the asset's or the cashgenerating unit's carrying amount is increased to the adjusted recoverable amount, however not exceeding the carrying amount the asset or the cash-generating unit would have had if it had not been impaired. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed.

3.1INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

Impairment losses during the year

Goodwill The Group's goodwill is related to the distribution network and company owned and operated stores. The goodwill relates in its entirety to the business Bang & Olufsen segment. In 2016/17 impairment losses of DKK 19.2 million have been recognised related to restructure and optimisation of the distribution as described in the management report (2015/16 DKK 0 million).

The assessment of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units which include goodwill is based on calculations of value in use, which is calculated based on both expected future cash flows according to the company's strategy, specified in the Strategy section in management review on page 28. The terminal value is determined on the assumption of a growth of 2.0 per cent (2015/16; 2.0 per cent). The growth rate is not expected to exceed the long-term growth rate. A discount rate before tax of 11.4 per cent is used (9.0 per cent after tax) (2015/16; 11.4 per cent/9.0 per cent).

Development projects The assessment of the recoverable amount of the intangible assets excl. goodwill is based on calculations of value in use of the assets. The value in use is calculated based on expected future cash flows from the assets based on the budgets approved by management over the expected lifetime of the assets, and a discount rate before tax of 10 per cent (2015/16; 10.0 per cent).

3.2TANGIBLE ASSETS
Accounting policies Tangible non-current assets are measured at cost price with deduction of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost price comprises the acquisition price and costs directly related to the acquisition until the time when the asset is ready for use. For self-constructed non-current assets, the cost price comprises direct costs for wages, materials, components and sub-suppliers.
Reimbursements and grants concerning tangible non-current assets are deducted from the cost price.
Interest expenses related to financing of the construction of qualifying tangible non-current assets are recognised in the cost price of the assets if they relate to the period of construction.
The cost price of a tangible non-current asset is divided into individual components that are depreciated separately if the expected useful life differs for the individual components.
For tangible non-current assets held under finance leases, the cost price equals the lower of fair value of the assets andthe present value of the future minimum lease payments. The interest rate implicit in the lease or the incremental borrowing rate is used as discount rate when calculating the present value.

Impairment The carrying amount of tangible non-current assets is reviewed at the balance sheet date to determine if there are indications of decreases in value. If this is the case, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined to assess the need for recognition of any impairment loss.
If the asset does not generate cash flows independently of other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest cash generating unit that includes the asset. The assessment is based on the details specified in the Strategy section in the management review on page 28.
The recoverable amount is determined as the highest value of the asset's or the cash-generating unit's fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. When the value in use is determined, the estimated future cash flows are discounted at their present value using a discount rate that reflects both the present market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks that are connected with the asset and the cash-generating unit, respectively, for which no adjustment has been made in the estimated future cash flows.
If the asset's or the cash-generating unit's recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. For cash-generating units the impairment loss is allocated to first reduce any goodwill amounts and then a remaining impairment loss is allocated to the other assets of the unit in a way so that no asset is reduced to a value below its fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. On any subsequent reversals of impairment losses recognised in prior periods due to changes in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, the asset's or the cash-generating unit's carrying amount is increased to the adjusted recoverable amount not exceeding the carrying amount the asset or the cash-generating unit would have had, had it not been impaired.
Impairment losses of DKK 22.7 million have been recognised in relation to specific tangible assets during 2016/17 as part of termination of leases and restructure described in the management report (2015/16 DKK 13.6 million).

Accounting policies Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost price according to the FIFO principle and net realisable value. The cost price of raw materials, consumables and purchased goods comprises the acquisition price including delivery costs. The cost price of finished goods and work in progress comprises costs of materials and direct labour plus indirect production costs.
Indirect production costs include indirect materials and wages, maintenance and depreciation on plant and machinery, factory buildings and other equipment used in the production process as well as costs of factory administration and management.
The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the expected selling price less costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Receivables Receivables comprise trade receivables, other financial receivables primarily loans to external parties and other receivables. The receivables are categorised as loans and receivables, which are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
On initial recognition, the receivables are measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost price, which normally correspond to face value less provisions for expected losses. Provisions for losses are based on an individual assessment of each outstanding account.
Prepayments Prepayments comprise incurred costs related to the following financial years. The prepayments are measured at cost.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities comprise trade payables and other payables to public authorities etc. and are measured at amortised cost.
Deferred income Deferred income comprises received payments related to revenue in the following financial years. Deferred income is measured at cost price.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Trade receivables Specific estimates of trade receivables are made on an assessment of the dealer's historical ability to pay and the current situation. The trade receivables amount to DKK 410.3 million as at 31 May 2017 (DKK 430.5 million as at 31 May 2016).
Inventories A specific assessment of the need for write-downs for obsolescence of inventories is made based on an assessment of the future sales potential. During the assessment the expected technological developments and the expected service periods are taken into account. In 2016/17, the accounting estimate related to service stock has changed, which has resulted in an additional impairment of DKK 22.5 million. Due to the change in accounting estimate and changes in the end-to-end operating model, a total write-down of DKK 41.8 million has been recognised in 2016/17 in relation to service stock and retail inventory. Inventories amount to DKK 347.3 million as at 31 May 2017 (DKK 498.0 million as at 31 May 2016).

Impairment of trade receivables is recognised in distribution and marketing costs in the income statement. The impairment charge is based on an individual assessment of each individual debtor's ability to pay. All overdue trade receivables are provided for, except for those where sufficient collateral has been obtained.

The carrying amount of receivables which fall due within 1 year after the end of the financial year, is expected to be a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

3.6PENSIONS
Accounting policies As employer, the Bang & Olufsen Group participates in pension plans according to normal practice in the countries in which the Group operates. There are two types of plans; defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.
Under defined contribution plans the Group recognises the pension contributions, which can either be a fixed amount of a fixed percentage of the monthly salary, in the income statement as they are paid to independent pension insurance companies. Any unpaid contributions are recognised in the balance sheet as a liability in other liabilities. Once the contributions have been paid the Group has no further obligations and the individual employee carries the risk for the value of the pension insurance at retirement. All pension plans in Denmark and most pension plans in the foreign subsidiaries are defined contribution plans.
Under defined benefit plans the Group has an obligation to pay a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the salary at retirement. This means that the Bang & Olufsen carries the risk of any changes in the actuarially calculated capital value of the pension plans. Bang & Olufsen currently operates with defined benefit plans in Germany and in Norway.
Annual actuarial calculations are made of the present value of the future benefits that the employees are entitled to. The present value is calculated based on a number of assumptions relating to the future development in salary levels and interest-, inflation-, and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit obligation net of the fair value of the plan assets is recognised in the balance sheet as a pension asset or a pension liability.
Changes in the assumptions mentioned above as well as differences between the expected and the realised return on plan assets cause actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
If the defined benefit plan is a net asset, the asset is recognised only if it corresponds to, or is lower than, the sum of unrecognised actuarial losses, unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Changes to the benefits, which relate to the employees' previous employment in the Group, cause a change in the actuarially calculated present value, which is regarded as past service costs. If the covered employees are immediately entitled to the changed benefit the change is recognised in the income statement at once. Otherwise the change is recognised in the income statement during the period, where the employees become entitled to the changed benefit.

Accounting policies Provisions comprise provisions for warranty, provisions for fairness and other provisions. Provisions for warranty are obligations to repair products within the warranty period, whereas provisions for fairness are obligations to repair products after the end of the warranty period.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of events in the financial year or previous years, and it is probable that an outflow of financial resources will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured on basis of past experience with warranty repairs employee anneversary benefits and other obligations.
Provisions that are expected to fall due more than one year after the balance sheet date are measured at present value.

3.7PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)

Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Bang & Olufsen Group repairs or replaces products that do not function satisfactorily both within the warranty period and in certain situations after the warranty period. Consequently, provisions are made for future repairs and returns. The provisions are made based on historical statistics of repairs and returns and based on management's judgements.

The future repairs and returns can differ from the historical pattern, but management assesses that the estimate of the provisions is reasonable and appropriate.

The Group provides 2-5 years of warranty on certain products and is therefore committed to repairing or replacing products which do not function satisfactorily. Some products are repaired after the end of the warranty period, and a provision is made regarding this potential fairness claim.

Provisions for warranty and fairness of DKK 56.6 million have been recognised as at 31 May 2017 (2015/16; DKK 60.3 million) to cover expected warranty and fairness claims. The size and timing of the provisions are based on previous experience of the level and timing of repairs and returns. The principles are unchanged from the 2014/15 financial year. The decrease in the provision is due to a reduction in repair costs and a changed product mix within the warranty period. No reimbursements will be received from third parties to cover the provisions.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING COSTS

This section contains notes relating to the capital structure and financial items of the Bang & Olufsen Group.

4.1M ORTGAGE LOANS AND LOANS FROM BANKS

Accounting policies Fixed interest loans, such as mortgage loans or bank loans, are recognised at the date of the loan at the received proceeds less transaction costs. In subsequent periods, the loans are measured at amortised cost price. This means, that the difference between the proceeds from the raising of the loan and the amount, that must be repaid, is recognised in the income statement during the term of the loan as a financial cost using the effective interest method.

The fair value is calculated as the present value of the expected future instalments and interest payments.

Other financial liabilities comprise overdraft facilities etc. and are measured at amortised cost price, which is practically the same as the nominal value.

4.3FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Accounting policies
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: ·financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; ·loans and receivables; or ·derivative instruments designated as hedges.
The classification is dependent on the purpose for which the financial asset is acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at the time of the initial recognition.
Financial assets are recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument or secures other access to economic benefits. Such assets consist of cash or a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset.
Financial assets, or a portion of a financial asset, are derecognised when, and only when, the entity loses control of the contractual rights that comprise the financial asset (or a portion of the financial asset). Such control is lost if the entity realises the right to benefits specified in the contract, the rights expire, or the entity surrenders those rights.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING COSTS

(DKK million)
4.3FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified under this category if held for trading, or if designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial instrument is classified as held for trading if acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling it in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Financial instruments in this category are classified as current assets and liabilities. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the statement of comprehensive income. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are included in the statement of comprehensive income during the period in which they arise. Financial derivative instruments on the statement of financial position are classified in this category.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. These are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months from year-end, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less impairments, using the effective interest rate method. Loans and receivables comprise the other noncurrent financial assets, trade and other financial receivables, amounts due by Group companies, cash restricted for use and cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified into the following categories: · financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; and · financial liabilities at amortised cost.
The classification is dependent on the purpose for which the financial liabilities were acquired or incurred. Management determines the classification of its financial liabilities at the time of initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation to transfer benefits and that obligation is a contractual liability to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial instruments with another entity on potentially unfavourable terms. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost This category of financial liabilities comprises preference shares (liability component), borrowings, trade and other financial payables and amounts due to Group companies. These financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group's criteria for a derivative instrument to be designated as a hedging instrument require that: ·the hedge transaction is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows at-
tributable to the hedged risk; ·the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured throughout the duration of the hedge; · there is adequate documentation of the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedge; and · for cash flow hedges, the forecast that is the subject of the hedge must be highly probable.

4.3FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
The Group designates certain derivatives as one of the following on the date the derivative contract is entered into: ·a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised as set or liability or a firm commitment (fair value
hedge); or ·a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income as financing costs/income, along with any changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest rate method is used is amortised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period to maturity.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within financing costs. Where the forecast transaction or firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains or losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. Otherwise, amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the statement of comprehensive income and classified as gains or losses in the same financial years during which the hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction affects the statement of comprehensive income.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Movements on the hedging reserves in shareholders' equity are shown under non-distributable reserves in the statement of changes in equity. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within financing costs.

Fair value estimation The fair value of publicly traded derivatives is based on quoted market prices at year-end. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at year-end.
Financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are classified into the following levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy: · quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical as sets or liabilities (level 1); ·inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly,
as prices, or indirectly, derived from prices (level 2); and inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data, unobservable inputs (level 3).
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the specific or similar instruments are used for non-current debt. The fair values of non-current financial assets and deferred payables for disclosure purposes are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the interest rates available to the Group at year-end. Other techniques, such as options pricing models and estimated discounted value of future cash flows, are used to determine fair value of the remaining financial instruments.
In assessing the fair value of non-traded derivatives and other financial instruments, the Group makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each year-end.
The carrying values of the following financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their fair values: · trade and other financial receivables; · cash and cash equivalents; · other non-current financial receivables; · amounts due to Group companies; · amounts due by Group companies; · trade and other financial payables; · current borrowings; and · non-current borrowings.

Foreign exchange rate risk In 2016/17 92 per cent of the Group's turnover was in foreign currency (2015/16; 91 per cent). Since part of the Group's purchasing policy is to match purchasing and sales currencies to the greatest possible extent, the figure does not express the Group's foreign exchange rate risk.

The Group has significant net in-flows in EUR, GBP, CNY and CHF, and the most significant exposure is presently related to these. The most significant exposure on the outflow is USD. The company thus only has a limited natural hedging of the currency risk.

The Group's foreign exchange rate risks are managed centrally by the parent company's finance department based on a foreign exchange rate policy approved by the Board of Directors, under which up to 80 per cent of the expected net cash flows in selected currencies are covered. Forward contracts are continually used for this hedging. The forward contracts are classified as hedging and fulfil the accounting requirements for hedging of future cash flow. Forward contracts are used for commercial transactions only, and hedging is made for a horizon of up to 18 months.

Besides the foreign exchange rate risk relating to current transactions, the Group's equity is affected by foreign exchange rate risks relating to the translation of the Group's foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to DKK.

Foreign exchange contracts As at 31 May 2017, the Group has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts at a repurchase value of negative net DKK 325.2 million (2015/16; negative DKK 32.8 million), with a fair value of negative DKK 16.7 million (2015/16; negative DKK 4.1 million).

Interest rate risk The Group interest rate risk relates to interest-bearing assets and debt.
The Group interest-bearing assets mainly consist of liquid funds, which at the end of the financial year totaled DKK 1,079.2 million (2015/16; DKK 788.5 million). Liquid funds yield interest in the short-term money market. The interest rate risk is deemed to be insignificant in that a change in the interest rate level of 0.5 percentage points would have impacted the Group's earnings before tax by approx. DKK 5.4 million in 2016/17 (2015/16; DKK 3.9 million).
At the end of the financial year, the Group's interest-bearing debt totaled DKK 179.3 million (2015/16; DKK 189.6 million) corresponding to 6.3 per cent of the balance sheet total (2015/16; 6.7 per cent).
Of the interest-bearing debt DKK 132.7 million falls due after five years (2015/16; DKK 143.7 million). Further information is provided in note 4.1.
Due to the low debt level and the fact that the borrowings are in fixed rate loans or loans with a fixed rate of minimum three years, the Group's interest rate risks are insignificant and are not expected to significantly impact the Group's earnings.
Credit risk The Group's balance sheet items that are subject to credit risk are primarily trade receivables and bank deposits. The amounts at which these balance sheet items are recognised correspond to the maximum credit risk.
At the end of the financial year, the Group sold its products through 626 dealers worldwide. The Group is, therefore, exposed to a risk of losses on trade receivables.
The individual dealers, including their geographical location, are subject to ongoing evaluation. When deemed necessary, the Group employs bank guarantees or debtor insurance against outstanding debts, and in some situations other forms of securities are attained, e.g. in the form of security in inventories or other assets.
In the 2016/17 financial year, DKK 43.9 million was expensed as impairments on trade receivables (2015/16; DKK 65.5 million).
Liquid funds are placed with financial institutions with high credit ratings. Derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts, are entered into with such institutions only. Therefore, it is deemed that the credit risk relating to liquid funds is of no significance to Bang & Olufsen's annual report.

(DKK million)
4.4CAPITAL STRUCTURE
The strategy requires substantial investments in R&D and other strategic inititiaves, driving the company towards a profitable growth and positive cash flow. Therefore, based on the company's result and to have sufficient funds to support the strategic initiatives, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that no dividend be paid out for the 2016/17 financial year. It is the intention of the Board of Directors to resume dividend payments as soon as the financial results can justify it.
4.5SHARE CAPITAL
Accounting policies Dividend Dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of approval by the Annual General Meeting. Treasury shares Acquisition and sales prices for treasury shares and dividend received on these shares are recognised directly in equity under retained earnings. Translation reserve The translation reserve for exchange rate differences in the consolidated financial statements comprises exchange rate differences that occur when translating the foreign subsidiaries' financial statements from their functional currency into Bang & Olufsen a/s' presentation currency. On disposal of net investments the exchange rate differences on the individual investment are recognised in the profit and loss account. The reserve is a distributable reserve. Reserve for cash flow hedges Reserve for cash flow hedges comprises accumulated changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, which meets the conditions for hedging of future cash flows, where the hedged position has not yet been realised. The changes in fair value are transferred to the profit and loss account, when the hedged positions are realised.

4.6SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AND MATCHING SHARES
Accounting policies Share-based incentive programmes Share-based incentive programmes, in which the Executive Management Board and selected other key employees are given the right to receive or buy shares in the parent company (equity-settled programmes), are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date and are recognised in the income statement as part of staff costs during the period where the employees become entitled to buy the shares. Share options have not been granted in the financial year 2016/17. Matching shares The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors decided in 2014/15 to implement a matching share programme (MSP) to replace the stock option programmes previously used as a variable component in compensation offered to the Executive Management Board and key employees. The participating employees are offered the opportunity to acquire shares in Bang & Olufsen a/s at their own cost, which after three years of ownership will provide the right to receive 1-4 matching shares per investment share, depending on fulfillment of certain perfomance criteria. The MSP is accounted for on an accruals basis over the three-year vesting period, as it is a condition that the employee has not resigned before vesting. The accounting value is the value of the maximum number of matching shares to be granted times the probability of the shares vesting. This probability is adjusted every year until vesting. To a limited extent, Bang & Olufsen a/s has purchased treasury shares to cover the obligation for the outstanding options. The shares are recognised directly in the equity. The holding of treasury shares totals 22,999 shares as at 31 May 2017 (22,999 shares as at 31 May 2016).

5.3DISPOSALS OF BUSINESSES

Accounting policies Newly acquired or newly established companies are recognised in the consolidated financial statements as from the date of acquisition or the date of establishment, respectively. The acquisition date is the date, where control of the company is actually obtained. Companies sold or liquidated are included in the profit and loss account until the date of sale or liquidation. The date of sale is the date, where control of the company is actually transferred to a third-party. When acquiring new companies, where the Group obtains a controlling influence in the acquired company, the acquisition method is applied, by which the newly acquired companies' identifiable assets, the liabilities and the contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
The consideration paid for a company is the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquired company. Acquisitionrelated costs are recognised in profit or loss in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
Positive differences (goodwill) between, on the one hand, the consideration paid for the acquired company, the value of minority interests in the acquired company and the acquisition-date fair value of previously held equity interests, and, on the other hand, the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised as an asset under intangible assets, and are tested for impairment at least once a year. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to the lower recoverable amount.
Bang & Olufsen s.r.o. As of 31 May 2017 Bang & Olufsen sold 100% of the shares in the Czech assembly subsidiary Bang & Olufsen s.r.o. to Tymphany Acoustic Technology HK Limited (Tymphany). All of Bang & Olufsen's 322 Czech employees have been transferred to Tymphany.

1ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The financial statements for 2016/17 for Bang & Olufsen a/s has been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) endorsed by the European Union and further Danish disclosure requirements for the presentation of financial statements for listed companies (class D entities) cf. the Statutory Order on Adoption of IFRS (the Danish announcement on Adoption of IFRS) issued in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. Accounting policies for the parent company are unchanged from the last financial and are identical to accounting policies in the Bang & Olufsen Group financial statements, except for the items below. For a description of the accounting policies of the Group please refer to the consolidated financial statements under the relevant notes. Investments in subsidiaries and associates Investments in subsidiaries and associates are measured at cost. If the cost exceeds the investment's recoverable amount, the carrying amount is reduced to this lower amount.

Dividend Dividend from investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognised, when the final right to receive the dividend is established. This is typically at the time of the Annual General Meeting's approval of the distribution of dividend from the company in question. Dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of approval by the Annual General Meeting. Investment property Investment property is held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation.

2C RITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
When applying the parent company's accounting principles it is necessary that management makes a number of accounting assessments and estimates as well as makes assumptions about the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities and the recognised revenue and costs, which cannot be deduced directly from other sources. Significant judgements are made when assessing provisions, development projects, trade receivables, inventories and deferred tax assets. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the given circumstances. The actual outcome can differ from these estimates. The estimates made and the underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuous basis. Changes made to the accounting estimates are recognised in the financial period, where the change takes place and future financial periods, if the change affects both the period, where the change takes place, and the following financial periods. The following accounting estimates are assessed to be material for the parent company financial statements. Development projects Development costs are capitalised only after technical and commercial feasibility of the projects have been established. In connection with the capitalisation of development costs, the expected useful life of the product is to be determined. Management has assessed that the amortisation period is usually 3-6 years.The development projects amount to DKK 334.8 million as at 31 May 2017 (DKK 382.8 million as at 31 May 2016). Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the value, the asset is expected to be realised at, either by setoff against deferred tax liabilities or as net tax assets to be set-off against future positive taxable income. At each balance sheet date it is assessed, if it is probable that sufficient taxable income will exist in the future, so that the deferred tax asset can be utilised. The deferred tax assets amount to DKK 131.2 million as at 31 May 2017 (DKK 70.1 million as at 31 May 2016).

The parent company recognises the pension contributions, which can either be a fixed amount of a fixed percentage of the monthly salary, in the income statement as they are paid to independent pension insurance companies. Any unpaid contributions are recognised in the balance sheet as a liability. Once the contributions have been paid the Group has no further obligations and the individual employee carries the risk for the value of the pension insurance at retirement.

18DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Accounting policies Discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of or in preparation for sale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and comparative figures are restated. Assets and related liabilities from discontinued operations are presented as separate items in the balance sheet, and the cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately in the cash flow statement.

Individual assets or groups of assets that are to be disposed of collectively are classified as assets held for sale, when the activities to carry out such a sale have been initiated and the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities of a disposal group that are directly related to assets held for sale are presented correspondingly.

Assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and assets held for sale except financial assets, etc. are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the shareholders of Bang & Olufsen a/s
Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of Bang & Olufsen A/S for the financial year 1 June 2016 ­ 31 May 2017, which comprise an income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the Group as well as for the Parent Company,. The consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company's at 31 May 2017 and of the results of the Group's and the parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 June ­ 31 May 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants

(IESBA Code) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements for the financial year 2016/17. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements" section, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements.
Recognition and measurement of Capitalised Development projects The Group capitalises development costs in accordance with IFRS, which prescribes capitalisation when

BANG & OLUFSEN A/S

ANNUAL REPORT 2016/17·132

KEY FIGURES·MANAGEMENT REPORT·STRATEGY & OUTLOOK·GOVERNANCE·ANNUAL ACCOUNTS·STATEMENTS MANAGEMENT'S STATEMENT·INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

certain criteria are met. Recognition and measurement of capitalised development costs were significant to our audit because the balance of DKK 335 millions at 31 May 2017 is material to the consolidated financial statements and because the criteria for capitalisation and impairment testing are subject to judgement and estimates based on Management's assumptions, including consideration of anticipated technological developments within the audio and TV industry and product lifecycle.
Additional details on capitalised development costs are provided in section 3.1 of the consolidated financial statements.
Our procedures in relation to the audit of recognition and measurement of capitalised development costs included, amongst other:
· Assessing group accounting policies and controls for compliance with IFRS and on a sample basis testing available documentation to consider whether the criteria for capitalisation were met.
· Testing and/or considering the assumptions applied in the impairment test by means of comparison with business plans, historic performance and Management's assumptions regarding strategy, product life cycle, market conditions and discount rates for selected development projects.
Measurement of Deferred tax assets The group has recognised a deferred tax asset of DKK 279 million as at 31 May 2017 due to historical negative taxable income with a tax asset from tax loss carry forward of DKK 136 millions and unrealised deferred tax asset of DKK 143 millions due to timing differences. The group has recognised the tax asset to the extent

that the realisation of the related tax benefits through future taxable profits are probable within a foreseeable future. We refer to Note 2.5 of the financial statements. This area was important to our audit due to the amount of the tax assets as well as the judgment involved in management's assessment of the likelihood and magnitude of creating future taxable profits to offset the tax assets. This assessment requires the Management to make assumptions to be used in the forecasts of future taxable profits, including expectations for future sales and margin developments and overall market and economic conditions.
Our audit procedures in relation to the audit of the measurement of the deferred tax asset included, amongst others:
· Evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the company. When evaluating the assumptions we checked for consistency with the assumptions used in the impairment test and the long term forecast and strategy plans.
· We also focused on the adequacy of the disclosures as included in Note 2.5 of the financial statements. The Management's assessment and conclusion of the recoverability of the tax assets and related disclosures are included in the above-mentioned note in the financial statements.
Statement on the Management's review Management is responsible for the Management's review.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements does not cover the Management's review, and we do not express any assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management's review and, in doing so, consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements, or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management's review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on our procedures, we concluded that the Management's review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement of the Management's review.
Management's responsibilities for the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Management is also responsible for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements

and parent company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.

the parent company financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements, including the note disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.

· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and

· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
