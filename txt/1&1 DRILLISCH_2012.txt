Management Board

Vlasios Choulidis Director of Sales, Marketing and Customer Care

Paschalis Choulidis Executive-Board Spokesman, Director of Finances, Financial Communication, Controlling and IT

Dear Sir or Madam,
2012 was the most successful year in our Company's history. We were able to carry over the highly positive developments of previous years without the slightest bump and we exceeded even our own ambitious targets. What is more, we did so in a time of economic uncertainty and against the backdrop of a problematic industry environment. Thanks to the positive course of business and the good cash position at Drillisch AG, we are joining the Supervisory Board in proposing a dividend of 1.30 per share.
During scal year 2012, Drillisch AG completed its transformation from a former classic service provider to a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), putting itself in a strategically excellent position. The Company surpassed the EBITDA target, which had been raised during the year to between 60 million and 61 million, ultimately posting a gure of 61.9 million; this success was above all due to the strong growth of 75.2% to 1.470 million subscribers in the MVNO clientele. We can clearly be condent as we move into 2013.
But before we look more closely into the earnings position, we want to report on a few other important events and developments.
Even before the rst half of the last scal year had passed, we had resolved all of the disputes with Deutsche Telekom AG in an out-of-court agreement. As we reported at that time, the termination of the contracts with Telekom did not have any negative effects on the operating business activities of Drillisch Group. This is evidenced in particular by the outstanding operating prot gures, which we will be describing in greater detail in our remarks and in the other sections of the Annual Report.
In addition, the nancial liabilities in the Group were restructured in 2012. In April, Drillisch AG issued a non-subordinated debenture bond vested with the right to convert to current registered shares of equity stock in freenet AG. The initial issue volume of 125 million was placed in full on the capital market at favourable conditions. The bond has a xed interest rate of 3.375% p.a. and a term of 5 years. In 2012, the dividends allocated to the freenet shares tied to the bond exceeded the interest expense. By issuing this bond, we have secured a low interest rate for the

Letter from the Management Board

long term, diversied our nancial sources and thereby enhanced our nancial and strategic exibility. Part of the revenue from the issue was used for the renancing of existing liabilities so that, besides the bond, the only existing liabilities due to banks per 31 December 2012 were at our subsidiary MSP Holding GmbH (142.6 million). These long-term loan liabilities are related solely to the acquisition of additional shares of freenet AG stock in 2011 and 2012 which are, together with the related hedging transactions, the only collateral for the loans. There is no liability risk on the part of Drillisch AG because these are so-called "non-recourse nancing" liabilities. In addition, Drillisch still has at its disposal a credit line amounting currently to 50 million which had not been utilised per 31 December 2012. This facility and the cash of 77.3 million on the balance sheet date provide us with the desired exibility and independence for 2013 so that we can continue to be an active player on the market.
Over the course of two stock repurchase programmes, we acquired an additional 3.2 million own shares on the stock exchange in 2012. Together with the 1.3 million shares acquired in 2011, we held approximately 4.5 million shares (8.4% of the share capital) of treasury stock per 31 December 2012. A total of 39.8m was expended for the purchase of this share block. The average purchase price was 8.88 per share. In accordance with the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 28 May 2010, the repurchased shares can be used for activities such as the nancing of acquisitions of companies or parts of companies, investments in enterprises or other assets or within the scope of corporate mergers. A later redemption or resale of these shares to third parties against cash payment is also possible.
During the past scal year 2012, we did more than simply maintain our excellent position on the highly competitive German wireless services market; we made good use of our innovative products to expand our standing. We do not look to achieve growth at any price; as in the past, we want to maintain quality and protability.
Our work is driven by our desire to offer transparent and clear rate concepts for voice and data. We hold a strong position on the German market for wireless services, where our established brands make us the price leader, and we are not content in meeting the minimum requirements as we regularly seek verication of our quality standards from independent third parties. Our top priorities focus on security and trust: security during the order process in our online shops and trust in high-quality service oriented to customer requirements. We have regularly been honoured for our accomplishments in these areas in the past, and will continue to submit to audits, some of them highly comprehensive, in the future.
The wireless services market is the most important growth factor for the telecommunications industry, and data services ­ the possibility to use the internet while on the go ­ will remain the number one growth driver for some time to come. This statement has been backed up by a number of different studies and analyses from the recent past. Estimates from VATM, for example, show that the total data volume in wireless networks rose by a breathtaking 30% from 101.1 million gigabytes in 2011 to 130.7 gigabytes in 2012. According to another study, the share of users accessing the internet via a mobile device in Germany increased by 13 perentage points to 40% during the same period.

Letter from the Management Board

We recognised this trend at an early stage and aligned our strategy as well as our products with this development back in 2011. Our success corroborates this decision. Our gures speak for themselves.
During the past scal year, the 342 associates at Drillisch AG achieved turnover of 323.7 million (2011: 349.1m). While in absolute gures this represents a decline in turnover, it was, rst of all, the result of a deliberate reduction of the weak-margin position Other sales, which includes as its main component the revenues from the sale of devices and prepaid bundles. Second, about 450,000 prepaid subscriber accounts were sold during the rst half of 2012 and so contributed to consolidated turnover only until the middle of May. This is why the service revenue, which essentially represents the calculation on the basis of existing customer relationships, also declined by 0.4% to 301.8 million (2011: 303.1 million).
If the gures from the years 2011 and 2012 are adjusted to compensate for the inuence of the prepaid accounts which were sold, making the comparison more accurate, total turnover, including Other sales, fell only slightly by 1.5% to 313.9 million (2011: 318.6 million). The adjusted service revenue, in contrast, rose by 19.5 million (7.1%) to 292.1 million (2011: 272.6 million). This increase is remarkable, especially in comparison with the competitors on the German wireless services market, and it lays the foundation for the ongoing positive development in our earning power.
Our concentration on higher-quality contract customers, especially the MVNO subscribers, led in total to a substantial qualitative improvement in the service revenues, which in 2012 were generated overwhelmingly from the 1.693 million postpaid subscribers (2011: 1.512 million). The major share came from the especially highvalue MVNO subscribers; their numbers rose by 75.2% to 1.470 subscribers (2011: 839,000) during the past scal year. The customer base in the prepaid segment was further reduced as planned and fell by 37,000 in comparison with 217,000 subscribers in the third quarter. As the higher-value postpaid business expanded, the share of postpaid subscribers rose by 30% to 89% (2011: 59%) over the course of the year.
But the total sales and the number of customers is only one side of the business and reects most of all the quantitative aspect. What is even more important for us is the added value we can generate from this development. We are highly satised with the prot gures for 2012. Gross prot came to 108.9 million per year-end, an improvement over the previous year (2011: 102.8m) of 6.1 million (5.9%). The gross prot margin rose by 4.2% to 33.6% (2011: 29.4%) and exceeded the mark of 30% for the rst time in Company history. The EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary expenditures and income posted a rise of 9.3 million (17.8%) to 61.9 million (2011: 52.6m), surpassing even the increased forecast. Consolidated prot (excluding the effects from the freenet holding) rose by 5.1 million (15.2%) to 39.0 million (2011:  33.8m) and the prot per share came to 0.76 (2011: 0.64).
The inclusion of the equity investment causes a decline in the consolidated prot to 23.5 million (2011: 41.0 million). The high uctuation in this item, which contains the market valuation of hedging transactions and other derivatives as well as the equity results of the freenet holding and the related nancing costs, is a consequence of the one-sided dependency on the closing date price of the freenet stock.

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

Letter from the Management Board
Valuation in compliance with IFRS means that the substantial rise in the stock price leads to an increase in the nancial liabilities effective on prot, but not on cash. Disclosing the corresponding increase in value of the nancial assets in the balance sheet, however, is not permitted. As a consequence, the book value of 259.8 million per 31 December 2012 shown in the consolidated annual accounts is in contrast to a market value of 373.6 million, leaving hidden reserves in the amount of 113.8 million. So while we are highly satised with the development of our holding, we have had to post high expenses from the closing date valuation quarter after quarter as the stock price has risen. These expenses would immediately be reversed if we were to sell the holding or if the share price of the freenet stock were to go into decline. Our corporate policy is based on the objective of sustained development because we want to offer our shareholders an attractive and uninterrupted return on their investment. As has already been stated, we will be proposing a dividend of 1.30 per share for scal year 2012 to the Annual General Meeting, the fourth increase in succession. In comparison with the dividend of 0.70 per share disbursed in 2011, this latest proposal represents an increase of ca. 85%. Our disbursement policy incorporates a stock repurchase programme as expedient along with attractive dividends. We have targeted a further increase in our MVNO clientele for 2013 and 2014 which will naturally lead to a continuation of the positive earnings development in operating business. We expect an EBITDA of between 67 million and 70 million for 2013 and between 77 million and 80 million for 2014. In conclusion, we would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks. We are indebted to our associates for their commitment and their performance. Dependable collaboration in a spirit of trust with our staff is very important for commercial success. But we are also grateful to our shareholders, customers and business partners for the trust they have placed in us.
Warmest regards from Maintal.

Report of the Supervisory Board

Dear Sir or Madam,

Drillisch AG is proud to report that it was once again able to increase signicantly all of the major performance indicators during the reporting period 2012. This is to a high degree a consequence of the decision to reorient the Company strategically and focus on postpaid subscribers in the MVNO sector, to divest most of the prepaid accounts and to eliminate deliberately the weakmargin items.

During the reporting period, the Drillisch AG Supervisory Board

diligently performed the duties required of its members by law, company charter and rules of procedure. It carefully reviewed and monitored the management activities of the Management

Marc Brucherseifer Dipl.-Kfm., Frechen. Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Drillisch AG.

Board and acted as an advisory body to provide support in the

management of the Company. The yardstick for the monitoring function included in

particular the legality, correctness, expediency and economic efciency of the Ma-

nagement Board's management as well as the performance effectiveness of the risk

management and the corporate organisation. Moreover, the Supervisory Board clo-

sely examined the situation and development of the Company and Group as well as

the business transactions during scal year 2012. The Management Board immedia-

tely involved the Supervisory Board in any and all decisions which were of fundamen-

tal signicance for Drillisch AG or Drillisch Group.

The Supervisory Board's activities were based on the reports submitted regularly, both orally and in writing, by the Management Board regarding corporate planning, the development of business and the business and nancial position, the strategic evolvement and corporate planning as well as the risk situation, risk management and protability of Drillisch Group. The Management Board addressed any deviations in the course of business from existing plans and targets and explained the causes of the deviations. The Supervisory Board regularly obtained written and oral information from the Management Board, in particular monthly reports and special information bulletins, about ongoing business development and important business events during the periods between Supervisory Board meetings as well. The full membership of the Supervisory Board examined and discussed in detail business events, especially those of major signicance for the Company, on the basis of the Management Board's reports; this was explicitly the case for measures subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and for transactions which strongly affected protability and liquidity. The Supervisory Board carefully examined the submitted reports for plausibility and, as necessary, discussed them in detail with the Management Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board requested supplementary information from the Management Board. Specically, the Management Board attended Supervisory Board meetings for the purpose of discussing and answering the questions posed by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board chairperson maintained regular contact with the Management Board during the periods between the Supervisory Board meetings and obtained information regarding the current business position and major business transactions, which he discussed in detail with the

Report of the Supervisory Board

Management Board; the Supervisory Board chairperson and the Management Board regularly talked about strategic questions and issues of risk management, the risk situation, planning and compliance as well. The Supervisory Board did not exercise its audit right pursuant to Section 111 (2) AktG [German Company Law] because the reporting by the Management Board rendered this action unnecessary.
Supervisory Board activities, meetings
In addition to the support of business development and planning, the Supervisory Board activities during the reporting period 2012 included in particular major decisions of commercial policies as well as any and all measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board. Above all, these activities encompassed the conclusion of an agreement with Deutsche Telekom for the termination of the contractual relationship and the conclusion of the legal disputes. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board, after conducting detailed discussions with the Management Board, approved the merger of eteleon e-solutions AG with MSP Holding GmbH and of SIMply Communication GmbH with Drillisch Telecom GmbH as well as the repurchase of own stock.
Moreover, a signicant focus of Supervisory Board activities was related to the holding in freenet AG. Besides the extensive discussion of strategic questions, the temporary increase in the freenet AG holding and the subsequent sale of a part of the freenet AG shares held by the Group were approved. Furthermore, nancing questions were discussed with the Management Board, including the issue of a bond convertible to freenet stock which was ultimately placed in the scope of 125m.
In addition, the Supervisory Board obtained regular information regarding commercial development and the situation of the Company and Group, especially the development of revenues and prot, the development of subscriber numbers, the gross prot indicators, the cash situation and development, the management of receivables and the Company's nancing situation, and discussed these issues with the Management Board. Moreover, the Supervisory Board enquired about the status of the tax audit covering the years 2007 to 2010. The Supervisory Board also considered the status of the assertion of claims against VS GmbH.
The Supervisory Board deliberated on strategic questions, market developments and the Management Board's middle- and long-term planning. The discussions covered the subject of the development of the subsidiaries. Among other topics, the cost assumption agreement between Drillisch AG and MSP Holding GmbH was addressed. The Supervisory Board considered the manager situation. Moreover, the appointment of ofcers and directors in the subsidiaries was one of the important topics during talks with the Management Board.
Supervisory Board activities focused as well on the reporting from the committees, in particular from the Audit Committee, and the monitoring of the risk management, the risk analysis and documentation of the risk control system. Supervisory Board and Audit Committee spoke in detail with the Management Board about issues of IT security.
The Supervisory Board engaged in an in-depth review and the improvement of governance and compliance at Drillisch AG. It adopted resolutions which included the disc-

losure of individual compensation to the Supervisory Board and took steps to extend the scope of the reporting and the review of compliance measures. In addition, the Supervisory Board considered the target agreements for the Management Board.
Moreover, the Supervisory Board examined the accounting for scal year 2012, the audit of the annual accounts, the preparation for the Annual General Meeting, the declaration regarding corporate management and the corporate governance report as well as questions of communications with the capital market.
A total of eight meetings of the full Supervisory Board in the form of personal meetings took place during the reporting period 2012 (on 23 February 2012, 22 March 2012, 10 May 2012, 25 May 2012, 9 August 2012, 12 September 2012, 13 September 2012 and 8 November 2012). In addition, two resolutions were adopted outside of Supervisory Board meetings during the reporting period 2012 (on 26 February 2012 and 19 March 2012).
The Supervisory Board's work is supported by three committees: the Audit Committee, the Personal Committee and the Nominating Committee.
The Supervisory Board Personnel Committee, whose members are Mr Marc Brucherseifer (committee chair), Mr Michael Müller-Berg (until 30 September 2012), Dr Horst Lennertz and Dr Susanne Rückert (from 31 January 2013) met only once in scal year 2012 (on 13 September 2012). The focus of its discussions was on the manager situation. In other respects, the responsibilities of the Personnel Committee were carried out by the full Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board Audit Committee, whose members are Mr Johann Weindl (committee chair), Mr Marc Brucherseifer, Dr Horst Lennertz and Dr Bernd H Schmidt, convened for a total of three meetings during the reporting period (on 19 January 2012, 9 August 2012 and 8 November 2012). It was especially concerned with questions of the accounting process, the internal control system, risk management and specic features of quarterly close-outs. Moreover, the audit conducted by the DPR (Deutsche Prüfstelle für Rechnungslegung), the focal points for the audit of the annual accounts 2012 and the review of the measurement for the freenet AG holding were among the activities of the reporting period. In addition, the question of the establishment of an internal audit was the subject of discussion.
The Nominating Committee, to whom all of the Supervisory Board members belong (chair: Mr Marc Brucherseifer), met a total three times during the reporting period (22 March 2012, 13 September 2012 and 8 November 2012), in each case as part of the full Board meeting. The Nominating Committee was primarily concerned with the lling of the Supervisory Board positions left vacant by the resignations of Dr Hartmut Schenk and Mr Michael Müller-Berg.
Personnel changes on the Management Board and Supervisory Board
There were no personnel changes on the Management Board during the scal year.
The Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2012 adopted a resolution electing Dr Susanne Rückert to the Supervisory Board. She is the successor of Dr Hartmut Schenk, who resigned his Supervisory Board position per 30 June 2011.

The ofce of Supervisory Board Chairperson continues to be held by Mr Marc Brucherseifer and that of Deputy Chairperson by Mr Johann Weindl.
Annual Accounts and Consolidated Annual Accounts 2012
The Annual Accounts and the Consolidated Annual Accounts per 31 December 2012, the management reports for the stock corporation and Group for scal year 2012 (each including the explanatory report on the disclosures pursuant to Section 289 (4), (5) and Section 315 (4) HGB [German Commercial Code]) prepared in good time by the Management Board and the accounting and risk management system were audited by BDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the accounting rm selected by the Annual General Meeting for this task, and an unqualied auditor's opinion was issued to the documents.
Regarding the system for the early detection of threats, the auditor determined that the Management Board had implemented the measures required pursuant to Section 91 (2) AktG, in particular with respect to the setup of a monitoring system, in an appropriate manner and that the monitoring system was suitable to detect in good time developments which could jeopardise the continued existence of the Company.
The separate and Group Annual Accounts, the management report and the consolidated management report and the related audit reports from the auditor were submitted to all of the Supervisory Board members. The audit activities requested in particular at the time the engagement was issued included in particular impairment tests of holdings/goodwill/brands, the disclosure in the balance sheet of the bond convertible to freenet stock, the merger of SIMply Communication GmbH with Drillisch Telecom GmbH, the merger of eteleon e-solutions AG with MSP Holding GmbH, the audit of the balance sheet effects from the disposal of REWE customers to congstar and questions of IT security related to the accounting. The nal documents were reviewed completely and discussed by the Audit Committee during meetings on 24 January 2013 and 28 February 2013, then by the full Supervisory Board during a meeting on 21 March 2013, in each case in the presence of the auditor. During these meetings, the auditor reported on the major results of its audits and explained them in detail. The auditor also answered questions from the Board. The subject of these discussions including especially the audit planning and the major points of the audit as well as the accounting process, the internal control system and the risk management system. The Supervisory Board agrees with the audit results concluded by the auditor and, after considering the nal results of its own audit, which were prepared by the Supervisory Board Audit Committee, does not raise any objections. In a resolution adopted during its meeting on 21 March 2013, the Supervisory Board approved the Annual Accounts and Consolidated Annual Accounts 2012.

This Declaration is issued in accordance with the version of the Codex of 15 May 2012 for the period since 15 June 2012.
Clause 2.3.3 second sentence Support of the shareholders in postal vote procedures The German Corporate Governance Codex as last revised on 26 May 2010 recommended providing support to shareholders when using a postal vote procedure if this opportunity had been made available to them. Since the company charter did not and does not provide for postal voting procedures, the Management Board and Supervisory Board issued a declaration last year declaring an exception to this recommendation and giving its reasons for the decision. The Boards believed that personal participation in the Annual General Meeting, especially open discussion among the shareholders, is an important element of the General Meeting. Moreover, Management and Supervisory Boards had not been able to determine that shareholders

Statement on Corporate Management / Corporate Governance Report

would thereby gain any advantages in the exercise of their rights over the proxy rights subject to instruction currently offered by the Company. Since the amended German Corporate Governance Codex as last revised on 15 May 2012 (entry into force on 14 June 2012, i.e. later than the Annual General Meeting 2012) no longer contains any recommendation concerning the support of shareholders using postal voting procedures, this declaration has been removed.

Clause 3.8 (3)

Agreement of an excess for Supervisory Board members in a D&O insurance policy for the Supervisory Board.

The Company has concluded a liability insurance policy covering pecuniary loss for the Supervisory Board which at this time does not include an excess. In the opinion of the Management Board and Supervisory Board at Drillisch AG, there is a risk that the agreement of an excess for negligent actions and the related liability risks would counteract the efforts of Drillisch AG to obtain the services of highly qualied persons to serve on the Supervisory Board. This is the reason for the basic decision not to agree to an excess. The Company will review the issue of an excess for Supervisory Board members in the event that additional insurance policies are concluded on their behalf. At this time, there is no legal obligation to provide for an excess in a D&O insurance policy for the Supervisory Board.

Clause 5.4.1 (2) and (3) Specication of concrete objectives by the Supervisory Board for its composition
In the past, the Supervisory Board reserved the right to decide on proposals regarding its composition in the concrete situation at any given time, especially with respect to qualications, expertise and personality. These criteria should continue to play a decisive role in the future. During the meeting on 21 March 2013, the Supervisory Board, in alignment with the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Codex, set forth its specic objectives and concrete targets with respect to its composition; the decisions are presented in the current corporate governance report.

Clause 5.4.6 (1) third sentence Inclusion of the chair of, and the membership on, committees in determining the compensation paid to Supervisory Board members.
In accordance with the currently applicable compensation rules in the company charter, the chair and the deputy chair positions on the Supervisory Board are given consideration in determining the compensation paid to Supervisory Board members, but not the chair of, or membership on, a committee. In view of the greater demands, both qualitative and quantitative, in advising and monitoring tasks being made on the Supervisory Board members and the greater time expenditures required for Supervisory Board activities, the Supervisory Board and Management Board will submit a proposal for the modication of the compensation rules for the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting 2013. The new regulation will, among other features,

14

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

Statement on Corporate Management / Corporate Governance Report

provide that an attendance fee be paid for committee work as well as for Supervisory Board activities; the amount of the fee will depend on the function performed by each member on the specic committee. In every case, payment of the attendance fee will be subject to physical attendance at personal meetings. Management Board and Supervisory Board of Drillisch AG are of the opinion that separate compensation for attendance at committee meetings will increase the efciency of the committee work and consequently that of the Supervisory Board as a whole more than separate compensation simply for membership on committees and that the condition of attendance at the meeting will simultaneously give due consideration to committee membership. But since the possibility that other opinions will be held in this respect cannot be excluded, a deviation from the above-mentioned recommendation of the Codex with regard to the intended amendment of the company charter is hereby declared as a precautionary measure.

Clause 5.4.6 (2) second sentence Merit-based compensation of Supervisory Board members
In the latest revision in 2012, the Codex, in deviation from the previous version, does not contain any recommendations for merit-based compensation for Supervisory Board members because widespread opinion holds that exclusively xed compensation is advantageous. Clause 5.4.6 (2) second sentence GCGC now provides that merit-based compensation ­ to the extent that it has been agreed ­ must be oriented to sustained corporate development. In accordance with Section 14 (2) of the company charter, the Supervisory Board members at Drillisch AG have in the past received meritbased compensation linked to the dividend disbursement. Owing to the lack of a more precise explanation of the criterion of sustainability by the Codex Commission and to the terminological proximity of the recommendation to the requirements of German Company Law concerning management board compensation, we cannot exclude the possibility that this provision requires assessment of the merit-based compensation for the Supervisory Board based on a period of several years. A requirement of this nature would possibly not be fullled by the dividend-related compensation paid to Supervisory Board members. As a precaution, we are therefore declaring an exception to this recommendation. However, Management Board and Supervisory Board intend to submit a proposal for an amendment to the company charter to the next Annual General Meeting, providing for the striking of the merit-based compensation components in compliance with the Codex and a rise in the xed compensation. The new regulation would become effective for the rst time in scal year 2013.

Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board Pursuant to Clause 5.4.1 of the German Corporate Governance Codex, the Supervisory Board is urged to designate concrete targets for its composition which, while taking account of the company's specic situation, give due consideration to the international activities of the company, potential conicts of interest, the number of independent Supervisory Board members within the sense of Clause 5.4.2, the denition of a maximum age for Supervisory Board members and its diversity. These concrete targets should in particular provide for an appropriate stafng of management positions with women. In view of these recommendations, the Drillisch AG Supervisory Board has set the following targets for the composition of its membership:
 The Supervisory Board should include at least two industry representatives from the sectors telecommunications, media and/or IT.
 The Supervisory Board should have at least one member with international experience (e.g. in the sector nancial engineering, telecommunications, M&A).
 No more than two former members of the Management Board should belong to the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members should reveal immediately to the Supervisory Board any conicts of interest which have currently arisen and, in the event of a permanent conict of interest, resign their position on the Supervisory Board.
 The Supervisory Board should have at least two members who do not have a personal or commercial relationship to the Company, its ofcers and directors, a controlling shareholder or a company afliated with the latter which can lead to a major conict of interest which is not only temporary.
 Supervisory Board members should withdraw from the Supervisory Board up-on conclusion of the Annual General Meeting following their 75th birthday.
 At least one member of the Supervisory Board should be a woman. The Supervisory Board's nominations of candidates for election to the Supervisory Board will continue to be oriented to the welfare of the Company, while taking these goals into account.

Working methods of Management Board and Supervisory Board
The corporate management is based on close, constructive cooperation in a spirit of trust between Management and Supervisory Boards as well as on detailed and constant ow of information ­ this is in line with the common understanding of good corporate governance held by Management and Supervisory Boards at Drillisch.
The Management Board currently has two members; the membership on the Management Board at this time is shown in the consolidated notes (page 102 of the Annual Report 2012). They manage the Company on their own responsibility and dene, in consultation with the Supervisory Board, the strategic direction of the Drillisch Group. The distribution of authority on the Management Board is regulated in rules of procedure. Fundamentally, each member of the Management Board manages the business units of the Company assigned to him by the rules of procedure on his sole authority. Measures of special signicance or which involve unusual risks always require the prior agreement of the entire Management Board. The rules of procedure contain in addition a catalogue of the major transactions and events which require approval by the Supervisory Board. The Management Board regularly and contemporaneously noties the Supervisory Board in written and oral form about the course of business, the position and protability of the Group, the planned business policies and other fundamental issues of corporate planning as well as about transactions which may be of major signicance for the protability or liquidity of the Group. Moreover, the Management Board reports to the chairperson of the Supervisory Board as required by other important events.
Until 30 September 2012, the Supervisory Board, in accordance with statutory provisions, had six members who are elected exclusively by the shareholders; the current membership of the Supervisory Board is shown in the consolidated notes (page 101 of the Annual Report 2012). The four Supervisory Board members Marc Brucherseifer (Dipl.-Kfm.), Johann Weindl, Dr Horst Lennertz and Michael Müller-Berg were elected by the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 30 May 2008; Dr Bernd Schmidt was elected as a member by the Annual General Meeting on 28 May 2010. Pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2012, Dr Susanne Rückert was elected to the Supervisory Board to complete Dr Schenk's term of ofce. Mr Müller-Berg resigned his ofce effective per 30 September 2012. The term of ofce of the current ve Supervisory Board members ends at the time of the Annual General Meeting 2013. The Board has an adequate number of members who are independent within the sense of Clause 5.4.2 of the German Corporate Governance Codex, i.e. who do not have any commercial or personal relationship to the Company, its ofcers and directors, a controlling shareholder or a company afliated with the latter. The Supervisory Board carries out its duties as a supervisory body both by monitoring the Management Board and advising the latter's members in the conduct of business. The Supervisory Board meets at least twice in every six-month period of a calendar year. It is quorate if and when announcements have been properly sent to all of the members and a minimum of three members participate in the adoption of resolutions. Unless otherwise provided by law or company charter, the Supervisory Board's decisions are made by simple majority vote. The Supervisory Board's working

methods are regulated in detail in rules of procedure adopted by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board reports on the Board's work in a separate Supervisory Board report. This report is printed on pages 8 to 12 of the Annual Report for scal year 2012. The names, professions and domiciles of the current Supervisory Board members and their membership on other supervisory boards formed in accordance with legal requirements and on comparable domestic and foreign governing bodies of commercial enterprises are listed on page 101 of the consolidated notes.
Working methods and composition of the committees The Supervisory Board has formed three committees, namely, a Nominating Committee, an Audit Committee and a Personnel Committee. Unless otherwise mandated by legal provisions, the provisions of the company charter applicable to the Supervisory Board as well as the Supervisory Board's rules of procedure apply mutatis mutandis to the committees. The Nominating Committee comprises all of the members of the Supervisory Board, chaired by the Supervisory Board chairperson, and is responsible for proposing suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for the latter's candidate proposals to the Annual General Meeting. The Audit Committee consists of Mr Weindl (Chairperson), Mr Brucherseifer, Dr Lennertz and Dr Schmidt and is concerned in particular with the monitoring of the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal controlling system, the internal risk management system, the internal auditing system and the nal audit. The chairperson of the Audit Committee is independent and, being a chartered public accountant and tax accountant, is qualied as an authority in the elds of accounting, nal audits and internal controlling procedures. The members of the Personnel Committee are Mr Brucherseifer, Dipl.-Kfm. (chair), Dr Lennertz and (until 30 September 2012) Mr Müller-Berg. The Personnel Committee is concerned with the affairs of the Management Board, including the terms and conditions of their employment contracts. The compensation for the Management Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board acting in its entirety as required by statutory provisions. Since there are two members of the Management Board, it has not formed any committees.
Information regarding corporate management practices within the sense of Section 289a (2) no. 2 HGB Drillisch AG regards the legal requirements for corporate management to be adequate. Consequently, there are no other corporate management practices relevant for Drillisch AG within the sense of Section 289a (2) no. 2 HGB.

Risk management
If the Company's success is to be assured over the long term, it is essential to identify and analyse the risks of business actions effectively and to eliminate or restrict their effects by means of the appropriate steering mechanisms.

The system is subject to constant further development and adapted as necessary to changing circumstances. As necessary, the Management Board regularly reports to the Supervisory Board regarding current risks and the measures initiated to handle them. The effectiveness of the internal risk management system is monitored by the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee.

The corporate strategy is based on sustained development of company value and builds on organic growth. The dividend policy alignment is long-term as well. Development of operations at Drillisch AG is positive, which is why we are budgeting a further increase in the EBITDA by 8.3% to 13.1% to 67 million to 70 million in 2013 concurrent with a rise in the number of MVNO subscribers.
The Company has steadily raised the dividend in recent years parallel to the successful growth in prots. We intend to offer our shareholders an attractive combination of dividends and stock repurchases for the coming years as well. The stock repurchase programme initiated in September 2012 was brought to a close on 21 January 2013.

The realisation of the disbursement policy described here is contingent upon Drillisch AG having at its disposal the corresponding balance sheet prot in its nancial statements prepared under commercial law for the respective scal years and upon the responsible boards adopting the corresponding resolutions, bearing in mind the current situation of the Company at each respective point in time.

The performance of the Drillisch stock during the stock market year 2012 in comparison with TecDAX
The development of the Drillisch stock in stock market year 2012 was better than that of the market as a whole. This is also reected in its placement in the index ranking of the TecDAX.

Growth in Smartphone and tablet market ongoing dynamic - Drillisch offers innovative rate plans for every user
Drillisch began focusing on the smartphone market and its dynamic growth at an early stage. By introducing innovative voice and data rates for smartphone and tablet users, the Company has raised the value of the enterprise. Thanks to our management's many years of experience, the strong commitment of our associates to performance and our lean cost structures, we have been able to realise successfully our corporate strategy even in this highly competitive market environment. Other major success factors behind this development include the introduction of transparent rate models offering simple wireless services solutions, tailored to match subscribers' personal usage, at leading prices as well as our commitment to sustained services which have been certied by impartial rankings. The trust and satisfaction of our customers is reected in their readiness to recommend us to others. From the overall perspective, market developments in the telecommunications sector are stable. The most important growth factor in the industry is, and will remain, the wireless services market. The many and varied possibilities for use of the mobile internet are the drivers behind the unbroken dynamics of the demand for smartphones and tablet PCs. More and more consumers are discovering for themselves how useful these services can be. This trend is supported by extensive investments in networks and new transmission technologies as well as the enormous variety in the available hardware. Smartphones and tablet PCs are now available at all price levels. The end devices themselves are becoming more diversied and appealing. As the trend in the direction of larger and larger displays continues, the boundaries between smartphones and tablets will become increasingly blurred. The undiminished high demand for tablets is leading to a decline in the sales of classic stationary computers. In Q3 2012, about 19% fewer notebooks and desktop computers were shipped on the German PC market in comparison with the same quarter of the previous year (source: Gartner study, beginning of November 2012).
More than 115 million wireless services connections in Germany ­ smartphones with a market share of 70% According to the most recent market study from VATM and Dialog Consult from October 2012, there were 115.1 million wireless services connections in Germany last year. This represents a moderate increase in the number of SIM cards found on the market in comparison with the gure of 114.1 million connections determined in the annual report from the German Federal Network Agency for 2011. A comparison of the minutes used for voice communication reveals once again the dynamics of wireless services. While the VATM estimates that the number of minutes for voice communication from landline services declined by 8 million minutes a day to 639 million minutes in 2012 (previous year: 647 million minutes), the duration of calls using wireless services connections increased by 17 million to 310 million minutes per day (previous year: 293 million minutes). For the foreseeable future, usage of landline services will at best stagnate while the usage of wireless services networks will continue to rise dynamically.

Surf, e-mail, chat ­ more and more wireless services users are discovering the experience of the mobile internet
The strongest growth is clearly being recorded for mobile data services. According to a study released by the Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft (BVDW), about 42 million Germans own internet-capable mobile phones and 31 million report that they possess a modern smartphone. The industry experts from BITKOM estimate the gure for smartphone sales in 2012 at 23 million units, an increase by 44% in comparison with 2011. These digital all-rounders with touch screen control have replaced traditional mobile phones. BITKOM assumes that in two years the latter models will have a market share of barely 10%.
A recent data survey conducted by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online Forschung (AGOF) ­ a cooperation of the leading online marketers in Germany ­ determined that 21.3 million Germans surfed the mobile internet in the second half of 2012, almost twice as many as at the time of the rst survey in 2010. At that time, a mere 10.95 million users roamed the mobile web.

Revenues from mobile data services is growing at double-digit rates

A new study by the IT consultants at Accenture used the data from a survey to calculate that there are 30 million people in Germany who regularly utilise the internet from their mobile devices. Only one year before, the corresponding gure had been a mere 14 million, notes the representative study Mobile Web Watch 2012. The growth determined here is also the strongest since 2008, the year when the survey was conducted for the rst time.
The shift to the mobile internet is causing the share of non-voice revenues in wireless services to increase steadily. Information from the VATM shows that this share has now reached the mark of 37.3% (2011: 34.6%). While the signicance of multimedia messages (MMS) remains negligible, the number of classic text messages (SMS) continued to rise in 2012 to a gure of 157.2 million text messages a day (2011: 147.8 million) despite the competition from Messenger programs such as WhatsApp.

Revenues from mobile data services have been growing at double-digit rates for years, data volume will quadruple
The industry association BITKOM calculates a gure of 8.5 billion for revenues from mobile data services in 2012, corresponding to a plus of 13% in comparison with the previous year. Business in this segment has been growing steadily at double-digit rates since 2009. In 2005, market volume for mobile data services amounted to 4.0 billion. In contrast, revenue from calls using mobile phones has been declining since 2006. In the reporting period, it fell by 4% to 12.8 billion. In 2005, calls from mobile phones accounted for 19.1 billion.
As a consequence of the continuing increase in the number of users along with the strong trend in the direction of applications demanding ever higher volumes of data ­ such as YouTube and other platforms ­ the quantity of data per device is expected to quadruple in the coming years. In an analysis from November 2012, the network equipment manufacturer Ericsson calculates that the next six years will see a leap from an average of 450 MB to 1.9 GB a month for smartphones and from 600 MB to 2.7 GB for table computers.

THE DRILLISCH GROUP AND THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT

Demand for smartphones and tablets are drivers for the mobile market

Tablets taking over as mobile end devices for home use
While smartphones are at hand anytime, anywhere, tablet PCs are used primarily in the home. According to BVDW, more than 10% of the people in Germany (about 8.2 million) use a tablet for mobile surng on the internet, and they spend an average of up to eight hours a week doing so. This means that the internet can become a substitute for television. While it is true that only about one out of ten surfs on a smartphone (9%) or tablet (7%) while watching television, more than half of all tablet users (52%) state that the television serves merely as background while they surf the internet on their tablets. Market gures from the industry association BITKOM from November 2012 indicate that there are 9.1 million tablet users in Germany. According to information from BITKOM, about 3.2 million tablets were sold last year, an increase by 52% in comparison with the previous year.

Performance and service have a higher priority than price for many mobile surfers
The most important criteria for wireless services customers are quality and service. This is the conclusion of a study conducted by Accenture. The costs for mobile surng are not at the top of the wish list. However, the Accenture study Mobile Web Watch 2012 also reveals that 86% of the respondents would accept signicant surcharges for additional services or improved network performance. So new transmission technologies such as LTE offer additional growth potential for the future. The experts from Deloitte predict that LTE will have a 10% share in worldwide revenues from mobile services in 2014. But future growth in services will be decisively inuenced by an adequate supply of attractive end devices as well as a powerful and widely available network infrastructure.

Drillisch offers excellent value for money
The brands under the Drillisch AG umbrella continued to set new milestones on the wireless services market in 2012, introducing innovative rate concepts and low-cost products. Thanks to a determined alignment with the continued boom on the smartphone market and mobile internet, Drillisch has also maintained price leadership in exible discount rates for mobile phone owners who primarily want to use their devices for phone calls and texting. The wireless services products from Drillisch AG enable users of all types ­ whatever their personal requirements may be ­ to experience all aspects of mobile communications.
TÜV awards seal in recognition of good value for money and top ratings for Drillisch brands
A comprehensive examination by TÜV Saarland in July 2012 once again conrmed that the customers of the brands simply, maXXim, helloMobil, McSIM and smartmobil.de are especially satised with the products and services they receive. They emphasise above all the innovative rate models and the outstanding value for money as well as the simplicity of the order procedures on the internet sites. Convinced as well of the professional competence and friendliness of the customer service representatives, more than three-fourths of our subscribers recommend our rate plans to their friends. These outstanding results from the representative customer surveys are the conrmation for us that our constant monitoring of our quality and service orientation is the right road to success for our Company.
Simple, transparent, and the price leader ­ Drillisch offers Germany's rst 6-cent mobile phone rate All of these honours are proof that offering leading prices for wireless services and customer-friendly service are not mutually exclusive. Drillisch was the rst company to pursue a strict policy of transparent products and is the price leader on the market. Just one example: in spring 2012, our introduction of the rst 6-cent rate in Germany (helloMobil) led again to conrmation from Stiftung Warentest (per 3 January 2013) that our customers retain complete exibility while enjoying the "lowest rate for anyone, whether they are on the phone rarely, a lot or constantly". Customers can order the 6-cent rate from helloMobil and choose either a billed service (postpaid) or advance payment (prepaid). By selecting an option for mobile internet use, subscribers can raise this rate plan to the level of a full-value "smartphone rate plan". This is what we call transparent and fair because users of classic discount rate plans can also use the mobile internet without any inconvenience.

 Mobile phone surfers with varying internet use: discount rates with OptiSurf, the

exible internet at rate with smart billing based on actual use.

 Extensive smartphone use: at rates for all networks, including internet at

Speed smart).

 For laptop, netbook or tablet users: attractive data rate plans for low, occasional

and frequent users (e.g. maXXim OptiData).

Drillisch the leader for at-rate plans to all networks
The "all-net at rates" of last year gave new impetus to the wireless services market. A monthly xed price offers users unlimited calls to landline phones and to subscribers in all of the wireless services networks as well as worry-free surng on the mobile internet. At 19.75, Yourat from simply, maXXim, helloMobil, PHONEX.de, McSIM and smartmobil.de as well as DeutschlandSIM Flat from b2c are the unchallenged leaders in many rate plan comparisons (e.g. Stiftung Warentest, teltarif.de, CHIP Online etc.).
In September 2012, Stiftung Warentest conducted a large-scale comparison and recommended the rate plans from all six Drillisch Group brands as the "lowest-price all-net at rate". Extensive reporting about the test results in many daily newspapers and other media with a high reach in the millions led to signicantly greater awareness of the new products without incurring any additional marketing expenditure.

Innovative products for tablet users as well

smartmobil.de expands market position ­ "Provider of the Year" for the second year in succession
The Drillisch brand smartmobil.de addresses a young target group with above-average buying power. The new brand has established itself rmly on the market in only its second year. Various channels ­ including a Facebook fan page or YouTube spots ­ are utilised to communicate a simple and clear message: Being smart means paying only for what you actually use when making phone calls, texting and surng on the go. smartmobil.de added additional rate plans with specic targets to its portfolio last year. Differences in usage behaviour are given due consideration with the options of All-in 100 (100 free minutes, 100 free text messages and an internet at rate), two new all-net at rates ­ with and without additional high-speed data transmission ­ and another budget rate plan for new users offering 50 free minutes/text messages, all in addition to the classic rate plan.
The innovative product and marketing concept at smartmobil.de is a success. For the second time in succession, the independent consumer portal tariftipp.de has singled out the Drillisch brand as the "Provider of the Year". As far as the telecommunications experts at tariftipp.de are concerned, smartmobil.de has the best rate plans in Germany. Important criteria for the award are good value for money as well as the company's innovative strengths and the customer friendliness of a rate plan. tariftipp.de singled out Yourat Speed smart for special praise as an all-net at rate unique in its segment, featuring surng speeds of up to 14.4 Mbit/s.
Innovation for data rate plans ­ surng even more exibly on a tablet thanks to OptiData
Drillisch is also setting new milestones for straightforward data rate plans in addition to the combined voice and data rate plans. Laptop, netbook or tablet users now also benet from the exible and intelligent billing logic of OptiSurf, the innovative internet at rate which Drillisch introduced last year as an option to smartphone rate plans.
The designation OptiData encompasses variable data packages of 100 MB, 200 MB, 500 MB, 1 GB or 3 GB. Full connection speed is available until the selected monthly maximum has been reached.
What makes this special:
if usage in one month is below the selected volume, only the volume level which has actually been utilised is billed. Exceeding the volume threshold does not result in any additional costs. OptiData gives customers a exibility never before available especially for devices which ­ unlike smartphones ­ are not used every day.

Drillisch top ranked in safety and services

Even simpler ordering procedure with the best possible security and more service in online management
Online marketing is the most important distribution channel for the Drillisch AG brands ­ low in cost and enormously efcient thanks to effective marketing instruments. And online trade is booming: the lion's share of the increase in retail sales reported by the Handelsverband (HDE) for 2012 came from the strong growth in online business.
Drillisch AG continued to optimise its online sites last year and redesigned the order procedure to be even simpler and easier to understand. The introduction of the shopping basket function ensures that customers placing an order retain an overview of their rate plan, the selected hardware and the booked options at all times.
Current subscribers also benet from our ongoing optimisation and quality assurance process. The new design of the customer account section and the "Servicewelt" has resulted in greater exibility for all of our brands. For example, customers can go to the mobile phone shop in the Servicewelt to order retroactively a mobile phone or smartphone at especially favourable conditions to accompany their rate plan. Moreover, management of personal data, the selected rate plan or the booked options has been further simplied. Subscribers can also choose to receive regular information about interesting offers and tailored rate plan recommendations.
TÜV honours the Drillisch webshops with the quality seal s@fer-shopping
The customers' trust is a decisive factor in online trade. The respected expert organisation TÜV Süd conducted a comprehensive certication process in March 2012 and determined that the online order procedure for the Drillisch AG brands is absolutely secure. It has consequently granted the quality seal s@fer-shopping to all of the webshops.
During the 3-stage quality check, the shop sites and order procedures were assessed and all of the relevant quality and security criteria were reviewed in a detailed on-location audit. According to a survey conducted by the Gesellschaft für Konsumgüter (GfK), s@fer-shopping is the best-known of the various online seals of approval. Surveys on www.simplytel.de and www.smartmobil.de conducted in collaboration with "Trusted Shop" resulted in excellent scores, which are further conrmation for building trust.

IT industry looks ahead to the future with optimism A recent survey by the industry association BITKOM from January 2013 revealed that most companies in the ITC industry are looking ahead to the new year with optimism. Seventy-one per cent of the companies expect rising revenues, while only 13% see a decline. Mid-size businesses are even more condent. More than three-fourths (76%) of the small and midsize IT companies expect rising sales, and 15% expect business to remain at the same level. The fourth quarter of 2012 developed in a highly positive direction for midsize IT businesses. Two-thirds of the companies (66%) reported rising sales in comparison with the same period of the previous year, and business remained at the same level for only 20%. In total, the IT industry had an excellent nish to the year 2012. BITKOM expects a plus of 1.6% for 2013, a gure which is higher than the German government's prediction for the general economy of 0.4%. Just as last year, BITKOM has singled out cloud computing and mobile applications as the major topics of 2013.

1.1. Drillisch completes the transformation from service provider to MVNO (mobile virtual network operator), continuing its corporate success story

During scal year 2012, Drillisch successfully completed its development from its previous position of a classic service provider into an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator), a transformation it launched at an early date. Drillisch AG ("Drillisch") is steadfastly continuing on its dynamic course of growth; in the scal year 2012 which has just nished, the rm was able to increase operating consolidated prot once again. Drillisch also expects its successful corporate story to develop along the same lines in 2013 and 2014.

Beginning with standardised and unbundled advance services from the wireless

network providers Telefónica O Germany GmbH & Co. OHG ("O ") and Vodafone

2

D2 GmbH ("Vodafone"), Drillisch generates exible services on the basis of its own

product ideas, and its innovative rate plans make it a prime player on the wireless

services market. Drillisch will continue to serve current customers in the Telekom

Deutschland GmbH ("Telekom") and E-Plus Mobilfunk GmbH ("E-Plus") networks on

the basis of the service provider agreements. However, the share of these customers

in its clientele is declining steadily.

Maintaining its role as price leader on the German market, Drillisch offers attractive rate plans under the various corporate brand names to serve the continued strong demand for smartphones (according to estimates from Bitkom: an increase of sales in 2012 by 43% over 2011). Visitors to the websites such as those of smartmobil.de, DeutschlandSIM or helloMobil can combine high-level smartphones with the lowest rate plans. Speaking generally, the focus is on the marketing of innovative voice and data products.

Sustained quality management coupled with product transparency and customer service
The certicates based on DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 which Drillisch had earned in the past were all renewed at the end of 2012. These certications are awarded by independent agencies on the basis of impartial audits. During the reporting period, ratings of "Excellent" and "Good" were achieved. Our brand simply, which became the rst provider of wireless services discount products to complete successfully the required audit and receive the DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 certicate for quality management in the areas of online product marketing and customer service back in 2010, stands as an example of our sustained efforts in this important sector. The quality criteria on which the certicate is based were once again conrmed during an audit in 2012 just as in 2011. MS Mobile Services GmbH ("MS Mobile"), Maintal, was also able to renew in 2012 the ISO certicate for outstanding quality management in the areas online product marketing and customer service received in accordance with DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 shortly after the brand launch of smartmobil.de in May 2011. The award of the ISO certicate to Drillisch Telecom GmbH ("Drillisch Telecom"), Maintal, in September 2012 completed the certication of all of the brands under the Drillisch

Group roof. Nationally and internationally, this is the most widespread and important standard for dening the quality of processes in a company.
But Drillisch is not resting on its laurels; it is continuing to work on maintaining and improving the quality of all of the corporate processes. Another example is the awarding of the s@fer-shopping seal in March 2012. This D21 initiative is Europe's largest partnership between the worlds of politics and business for the information society and is recommended by the German Federal Ministry of Justice. This honour is the verication that Drillisch offers to all of its customers outstanding transparency and security at the highest level. The updating of the internet sites of all of the Drillisch brands, completed at the turn of the year, represented the next step in this direction.
Drillisch has repeatedly received conrmation from independent, external authorities that the quality of its services, independently of price, is in conformity with the highest standards nationally and internationally and is among the best anywhere.
Drillisch AG is the Group's holding
Within Drillisch Group, Drillisch AG, the parent company, concentrates on holding tasks such as management, nances and accounting, controlling, cash management, human resources, risk management, corporate communications and investor relations along with the denition, management and monitoring of the global corporate strategy. The subsidiaries Drillisch Telecom, MS Mobile and eteleon e-solutions AG ("eteleon") via its subsidiary b2c.de GmbH, both in Munich, are responsible for the operational wireless services business. The IT know-how of Drillisch Group has been concentrated in IQ-optimize Software AG ("IQ-optimize"), Maintal. MSP Holding GmbH ("MSP"), Maintal, is an afliated company; per 31 December 2012, this afliate and Drillisch AG together held more than 20% of the share capital of freenet AG, Büdelsdorf.
Improving efciency by streamlining the group-wide organisational structure
The entry in the Commercial Register on 24 August 2012 completed the assimilation of the wholly-owned subsidiary SIMply Communication GmbH, Maintal, by Drillisch Telecom. Drillisch's intention in carrying out this organisational merger of the two wireless services providers into one company is to achieve a further enhancement of efciency and clout. There will be no change for the established brand simply on the market.
Drillisch Telecom ­ strong brands in mobile communications
Drillisch Telecom offers attractive rate plans ­ for both voice telephony and mobile surng on the internet ­ under the online brand names McSIM, helloMobil, simply and PHONEX and the premium brands VICTORVOX and Telco. Customers can browse the appropriate online shops and select from the latest models of smartphones, tablet PCs and notebooks. At the end of March 2012, Drillisch Telecom proved that inexpensive phone calls can cost even less when it introduced the new 6-eurocent rate from helloMobil. Customers choosing this plan can phone and text for only 6 eurocents a minute and text message, nationwide in Germany, to all networks and

Since April 2012, Drillisch Telecom has also been offering to PHONEX and Telco subscribers the opportunity to make unlimited phone calls to all German networks by selecting the Allnet Flat Option starting at 9.95 a month. Drillisch Telecom and its brands McSIM, simply, PHONEX and helloMobil have undergone the TÜV Süd certication process and have been awarded the quality seal "s@fer-shopping" so that customers can enjoy secure shopping as well as obtain a low-cost mobile phone in the Company's own webshops. In short: Drillisch Telecom, the price leader on the German market, offers the highest level of transparency and security as well.
MS Mobile ­ smart rates with smart service ­ tested and found to be smart
MS Mobile and its smartmobil.de offer rate plans which have been tailored to be a perfect t for the needs of smartphone users. The simple, low-cost and transparent services offered by MS Mobile are trend-setters in the wireless services sector, and the Allnet Flat Option, for example, makes it possible to phone without limits to all German networks.
smartmobil.de has the right travel package for anyone who wants to use a mobile phone for surng while abroad. smartmobil.de customers have long known that smartmobil.de is outstanding. Only shortly after its appearance on the market in April 2011, the brand won the honour of "UMTS Provider of the Year" awarded by the independent rating portal "tariftipp.de". In February 2012, Stiftung Warentest crowned the rate plan "All-in Flat" at smartmobil as the "the plan with the lowest rates for heavy phone users". In its 5/2012 issue, the magazine Computerbild recommended the smart entry-level rate "All-in 50" as one of the best package rate plans in the country for people with a normal or low level of phone usage.
MS Mobile is very proud of the tremendous readiness of its customers to recommend all of the brands. In December 2012, smartmobil.de was honoured as the "Provider of the Year" by Tariftipp.de. "All-in 100" and "Yourat smart" are the Rate Plans of the Year in 2012. These awards and others conrm the excellent results of the representative customer survey conducted by TÜV Saarland at the beginning of July 2012; they revealed that smartmobil.de offers ideal "value for money", and this is not limited to the rate plans. Customers can select the right smartphone for their needs and combine low-price rate plan alternatives with the latest hardware.

1.2. Company management ­ objectives and strategies The Company's strategy emphasises protable growth. The focus for new business is on the marketing of innovative and low-cost products. In the estimation of the Management Board, low, transparent rates represent the greatest opportunities for growth on the German market. The highest growth rates here are expected in the data communications sector. The Company has placed its own successful brands, including simply, maXXim, McSIM, helloMobil, smartmobil.de, DeutschlandSIM, discoPLUS and discoTEL. Drillisch also offers attractive rate plans in combination with smartphones and tablets, enabling the Company to benet from the continuing boom in demand for mobile highend devices. The expansion of current sales activities and the opening of new distance trade channels by means of attractive product lines are at the forefront of the Company's efforts. Our quality management staff actively and continuously review products and services, working to raise the gross prot and EBITDA margins.
Value-oriented management system The focus of the value-oriented management system at Drillisch is on a long-term increase in the corporate value through protable growth. The key performance indicator is the adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, adjusted for extraordinary and one-off factors). In addition to the EBITDA, gross prot and cash ow are the subjects of special attention. Major elements of value-oriented management include:
1. Thanks to its lean structure, Drillisch operation is highly efficiently in terms of costs. This approach has enabled the Group to increase its EBITDA continuously over the past ten years. Drillisch achieves this high level of economic efficiency by consistently optimising business processes and by making efficient use of its personnel.
2. The major IT services required at Drillisch are performed by its subsidiary IQ-optimize so that the Company is not dependent on external providers. The structure enables fast and flexible action and response on the market.
3. Drillisch is innovative in the design and development of new products and rate plans. The Company is one of the first providers to sell wireless services under its own discount brand name. This innovation strength makes it possible for the Group to develop new business fields ahead of competitors.
4. Drillisch constantly works on the further development of distribution paths, taking advantage of its competence and new ideas, so that the Company can successfully market its innovative products.
5. Moreover, long years of experience in the Company and on the wireless services market are available to Drillisch at the first and second management levels.

1.3. Market and competition
Wireless services sales in Germany rise slightly again in 2012
According to a TC market analysis conducted jointly by Dialog Consult and VATM, sales on the German wireless networks market rose slightly from 24.6 billion in the previous year to 24.8 billion in 2012. This growth in revenue resulted primarily from the increased sales of data services attributable to the realisation of mobile internet access. The number of active SIM cards rose from 114.1 million in the previous year to 115.1 million in 2012. Voice transmission using wireless services increased from 293 million minutes a day in 2011 to 310 million minutes in 2012 and clearly compensated for the decline in call minutes on landline phones. As management expected, the data volume on the wireless services networks rose further at a breakneck pace. Estimates from VATM indicate that the total data volume increased by 30% from 101.1 million gigabytes in 2011 to 130.7 million gigabytes in 2012. The share of revenue from mobile data transmission in the sector of non-voice sales grew from 65% in 2011 to 68% in 2012. This translates to about 4.4 billion in wireless services revenues for mobile data transmission. The demand for higher data volumes and technologies for faster data transmission (e.g. LTE) along with the integration of various media on mobile devices will secure growth potential for wireless services providers in the future as well. The steady rise in mobile data transmission is also the cause of the further shift in the relationship between data and voice transmission. According to the German Federal Network Agency, there is an ongoing decline in the network costs incurred by voice transmission. This is why the wireless services forwarding charges (costs for the transfer of calls into a different wireless network) were reduced from 3.36 eurocents or 3.39 eurocents per minute to a standard 1.85 eurocents per minute per 1 December 2012. There will be a further reduction to 1.79 eurocents a minute per 1 December 2013. Estimates indicate that German wireless services companies will lose about 500 million in annual revenues as a consequence.
IT industry growth continues in 2012
The IT industry was in 2012 able to continue the positive development of the previous year without so much as a hiccough. According to information from BITKOM (October 2012), sales in Germany rose by about 2.3% to 72.8 billion, substantially faster than the overall economy. Eight of ten companies presume that income will rise in 2013 as well and are planning to create more jobs. The IT industry remains one of the job engines in the German economy and is one of the most innovative branches of business.
Drillisch holds its position on the wireless services market
Drillisch is in competition with the four network operators (Vodafone, O , Telekom 2
and E-Plus) as well as with other service providers and MVNOs. The network operators have a market share of about 84.9% in Germany as shown in a TC market analysis from VATM in 2012. The remaining market is essentially shared by the service provider freenet and the independent service providers Drillisch and United Internet.

1.4. General economic conditions
"Competitiveness ­ Key to Growth and Employment in Germany and Europe" is the title of the annual economic report published by the German government in January 2013. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.7% in 2012 means that the German economy was unable to maintain the pace of economic development from the previous year, but it still displays a positive tendency despite the weak development of the global economy and the crisis of condence in Europe. In view of these factors, the German government is predicting growth of 0.4% for 2013. Dr Philipp Rösler, German Minister of Economics, assumes, however, that this weakness is only temporary and expects growth in GDP of 1.6% in 2014. More people than ever before, almost 42 million workers, were employed in Germany in 2012. Owing to the positive development in gross pay scales in 2012 and the predicted increase in 2013 (+2.3%), the German government is also expecting a rise in domestic demand.
However, the Drillisch Management Board has noticed little impact on the Company's own wireless services business from the rise and fall of the economy in recent years. The steady growth in the discount business and for mobile Internet has been of greater signicance.
1.5. Turnover and earnings position
Pursuing the strategy to transform the Company into an MVNO was rewarded immediately in scal year 2012 by signicant growth in EBITDA. This good development of our business is supported by the ongoing dynamic developments in the elds of wireless services and mobile internet. Drillisch uses innovative products in conjunction with efcient marketing and sales concepts to sustain its top position in the German telecommunications industry.
The "service revenues", essentially the income from the provision of the ongoing wireless services (voice and data transmission) and their billing on the basis of the current customer relationships, amounted to 301.8 million in 2012 (previous year: 303.1 million). During the rst months of 2012, 9.7 million came from the prepaid clientele which was sold in May 2012. In the previous year, these subscribers made a signicantly greater contribution (30.5 million) to the consolidated income. If the income from the sold subscribers were eliminated for both years, "service revenues" would have risen by 19.4 million (7.1%) from 272.6 million in 2011 to 292.1 million in 2012. The growth in the segment of the signicantly more protable MVNO subscribers was able to compensate for the decline in "service revenues" almost completely, which had a positive effect on gross income and gross prot margin as well.
"Other revenues", which include low-margin business such as sales of devices and prepaid bundles along with the intermediary business of b2c.de GmbH, declined by 24.1 million to 21.9 million (previous year: 46.0 million). This is also the item where sales from the segment of software services in the amount of 75k (previous year: 62k) are reported.
In total, revenues came to 323.7 million (previous year: 349.1 million) in 2012. The subscriber base in the signicantly more protable postpaid business rose further by

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

Business Report

181,000 (12.0%) in comparison with the end of 2011 to 1.693 million subscribers (31 December 2011: 1.512 million subscribers). This gure included 1.470 million MVNO subscribers at the end of 2012 (31 December 2011: 0.839 million MVNO subscribers).
The number of subscribers in the prepaid sector was reduced to 217,000 (31 December 2011: 1.038 million subscribers). This is a result of the continuing removal of inactive subscribers as well as of the sale of a part of the prepaid clientele noted in the report for the rst half of the year. Overall, the ratio of postpaid to prepaid subscribers has improved to 89% to 11%, an increase of 30 percentage points for postpaid compared to the end of 2011 (31 December 2011: 59% postpaid to 41% prepaid). The total number of subscribers has been reduced by 640,000 to 1.910 million (31 December 2011: 2.550 million).
The decrease in the cost of materials by 12.8% to 214.8 million (previous year: 246.3 million) was clearly overproportionate to the decline in revenues during 2012. As a consequence, the gross prot improved by 5.9% to 108.9 million (previous year: 102.8 million). The gross prot margin increased by 4.2% to 33.6% (previous year: 29.4%). Personnel expenses increased by 8.7% to 22.6 million (previous year: 20.8 million). Correspondingly, the personnel expenses ratio in 2012 rose by 1.0% to 7.0% (previous year: 6.0%). Other operating expenses remained virtually constant at 34.4 million (previous year: 34.3 million). The advertising costs of 7.6 million, which were substantially lower than in the previous year (17.1 million), are in contrast to higher expenses for third-party services (used primarily within the context of the transfer of the clientele to the MVNO model and for the operation of the MVNO platform) and the rise in legal and professional expenses and expenditures from the loss of receivables and bad debt allowances.
The consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation), one of the most important management indicators in the Drillisch Group, rose by 20.4% to 61.9 million (previous year: 51.4 million). The adjusted consolidated EBITDA in 2012 amounted to 61.9 million in comparison with 52.6 million in the previous year. Extraordinary expenses 2011 amounting to 1.2 million concerned the derecognition of a residual claim from a settlement in scal year 2009 and extraordinary charges related to a legal dispute. The adjusted EBITDA margin came to 19.1% (previous year: 15.1%). Depreciation and amortisation increased, primarily a consequence of the investments in intangible assets in Q3, by 92.1% to 6.4 million (previous year: 3.4 million), As a consequence, the EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 15.3% to 55.5 million (previous year: 48.1 million). The EBIT ratio improved by 3.3 percentage points to 17.1% (previous year: 13.8%).
The shares in freenet AG held by MSP and Drillisch AG were valuated according to the equity method per 31 December 2012, just as in the previous year, because of the signicant inuence on the company from the voting rights quota. This inclusion resulted in a gure of 54.3 million per 31 December 2012 (previous year: 28.3 million) comprised of the prot proportionately attributable to Drillisch of 38.0 million, expenditures of 3.0 million from scheduled depreciation within the framework of the purchase price allocation and other income of 19.3 million, essentially book prots from the sale of freenet stock.

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Business Report
Other nancial results per 31 December 2012 amounted to -78.3 million (previous year: -19.9 million). The closing date valuation of hedging transactions concluded in the context of the nancing of the freenet stock acquired in 2011 and in Q2 2012 resulted in non-cash expenses of 53.7 million (previous year: 12.8 million). The value of these hedging transactions is recalculated as of every closing date and is primarily a result of the price of the freenet stock on the closing date and of the remaining term. A rising stock price tends to lead to a declining value of the hedging transactions, which can also be negative. In this case, it is disclosed under the long-term nancial liabilities. If the value on the closing date is positive, it is capitalised under Other nancial assets. The results of this closing date valuation per 31 December 2012 are shown as liabilities in the amount of 54.2 million (31 December 2011: 6.5 million). The closing date valuation of nancial derivatives related to the issue of a debenture bond led to additional non-cash expenses in the amount of 7.2 million (previous year: 0). Additional expenses of 17.4 million (previous year: 7.9 million) were incurred with respect to payment obligations agreed within the context of a nancing transaction.
The interest result declined by 6.5 million to -10.7 million (previous year: -4.2 million). One of the reasons for the decline in the interest result is that the bank loans were utilised at the end of Q1 and during Q2 in 2011, meaning that the charge to the interest result was only pro rata temporis. Another is that the issue of the debenture bonds on freenet stock in April 2012 increased the volume of the long-term interestbearing liabilities as a whole.
Taxes on income fell by 14.0 million primarily owing to the creation of deferred tax reimbursements effective on results within the context of the closing date valuation of nancial derivatives, resulting in income of 2.7 million (previous year: expenditure of 11.3 million) for 2012. Consolidated prot amounted to 23.5 million (previous year: 41.0 million). Excluding the effects from equity disclosure in the balance sheet, market valuation of hedging transactions and derivatives and the interest expenses allocated to equity investment, consolidated prot in 2012 amounted to 39.0 million (previous year: 33.8 million). The prot per share amounted to 0.46 (previous year: 0.77) or, excluding the equity investment, 0.76 (previous year: 0.64).
General statement on business development
Operating in a favourable, although highly competitive economic sector, Drillisch Group fullled the business forecast which had been reconrmed in November 2012. The number of subscribers in the signicantly more protable postpaid business was increased further. The protability and yield indicators relevant for Drillisch of gross prot and gross prot margin, along with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA ratio, continued to improve. Business development clearly demonstrated that Drillisch has for many years been pursuing a course of consistently protable growth which is largely independent of general economic uctuations. Management Board and Supervisory Board will therefore propose a dividend of 1.30 for each share entitled to dividends to the Annual General Meeting.

1.6. Assets, liabilities and nancial position
Fixed assets rose by a total of 73.2 million to 391.7 million (31 December 2011: 318.5 million). As a consequence of the investments related to the continued expansion of the MVNO business model, Other intangible assets increased by 29.8 million to 40.7 million (31 December 2011: 10.9 million). Financial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method increased by 23.4 million to 259.8 million (31 December 2011: 236.4 million). These assets include the stock held in freenet AG. Since Drillisch AG, together with MSP, holds more than 20% of the freenet AG share capital, the shares are disclosed in this item. The shares are valued at cost of acquisition, which was rolled over with the share of the continued development of the freenet equity attributable to Drillisch ("equity method"). The price of freenet stock per 31 December 2012 was 14.00 a share. The closing date value of the holding per 31 December 2012 was 113.8 million higher than the book value, the "hidden reserves" on the closing date. In Q2 2012, Drillisch concluded a second hedging transaction related to the further investments in the freenet AG holdings.
The rise in deferred tax reimbursements is a consequence primarily of the deferred taxes created during the closing date valuation of nancial derivatives.
Cash rose by 56.6 million to 77.3 million (31 December 2011: 20.7 million). Trade receivables rose slightly by 0.3 million to 42.0 million (31 December 2011: 41.7 million). In total, current assets increased by 55.6 million to 130.8 million (31 December 2011: 75.2 million).
Overall, the balance sheet total for Drillisch Group per 31 December 2012 rose by 128.9 million to 522.6 million (31 December 2011: 393.7 million).
In comparison with 31 December 2011, equity decreased by a total of 44.5 million to 120.5 million (31 December 2011: 165.0 million), a consequence in part of the continued repurchase of treasury stock. As a consequence of the dividend distribution, balanced by the results for the year 2012, the accumulated decit rose by 12.7 million to 55.8 million (31 December 2011: 43.1 million). The accumulated decit arose in 2008 from the change in the stock market evaluation of the freenet AG shares. The equity ratio per 31 December 2012 came to 23.0% (31 December 2011: 41.9%).
Long-term liabilities rose by a total of 173.3 million to 336.3 million (31 December 2011: 163.0 million). One factor for the increase was Drillisch AG's issue of the nonsubordinate debenture bond vested with the right to convert to current registered shares of equity stock in freenet AG in April 2012; per 31 December 2012, the bonds are measured in the balance sheet at 118.7 million (31 December 2011: 0). A second factor concerned the hedging transactions and nancial derivatives disclosed under the Financial liabilities, which must also be carried at current fair value as liabilities. Owing mainly to the rise in the price of the freenet AG stock, the valuation per 31 December 2012 resulted in a liability totalling 67.9 million (31 December 2011: 6.5 million). Liabilities due to banks declined per 31 December 2012 by 8.6 million to 142.6 million (31 December 2011: 151.2 million) and comprise exclusively long-term loan liabilities of MSP for the acquisition of additional shares in freenet AG in 2011 and 2012, which, together with the hedging transactions, serve as the

44

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Business Report

sole collateral for the loans. There is no risk of Drillisch AG becoming liable for the loan liabilities assumed by MSP because they are "non-recourse nancing" transactions. The total from the debenture bond, long-term liabilities due to banks and liabilities from derivatives in the amount of 329.2 million is contrasted with xed assets shown in the balance sheet from the participation in freenet of 259.8 million (31 December 2011: 236.4 million) and "hidden reserves" not shown in the balance sheet of about 113.8 million (31 December 2011: 23.6 million). Please see Item 20 of the consolidated notes for a detailed description of the liabilities due to banks, Financial liabilities and the debenture bond.
Short-term liabilities rose slightly by 0.2 million to 65.9 million in comparison with the end of scal year 2011 (31 December 2011: 65.7 million). Trade payables decreased by 9.0 million to 16.1 million (31 December 2011: 25.1 million). Tax liabilities increased by 3.7 million to 9.4 million (31 December 2011: 5.7 million). Payments received on account fell by a total of 13.2 million to 9.2 million (31 December 2011: 22.4 million), primarily because of the decline in prepaid credits resulting from the reduction in the number of prepaid subscribers and the substantial reduction in voucher sales. The increase in Other liabilities by 15.4 million to 26.6 million (31 December 2011: 11.2 million) comes essentially from investment liabilities incurred in Q3 2012 by investments in intangible assets.
1.7. Cash ow
Cash ow from current business activities amounted to 24.3 million (previous year: 20.0 million) in scal year 2012. A major part of the one-off negative liquidity effects in Q1 2012 related to the change of business model was compensated by the good operating business as of the end of the year. The decline in prepaid business pursuant to the partial sale and reduction in the number of subscribers and the substantially reduced sales of vouchers led to a signicant reduction in trade liabilities and other liabilities and provisions totalling 4.9 million (previous year: decrease by 4.0 million) and in Payments received on account, especially in the form of credit balances and voucher balances which have not been used to top up cards, of 13.2 million (previous year: decline of 3.1 million).
Cash ow from investment activities totalling 7.8 million (previous year: -69.8 million) is decisively characterised by payments for investments in nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method amounting to 75.3 million and payments for investments in tangible and intangible assets of 23.0 million. These payments for investments are contrasted by incoming payments from the sale of nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method of 67.7 million and from received dividends of 38.4 million.
During scal year 2012, there was a total inow of funds of 24.5 million (previous year: inow of 42.9 million) from nancing activities. This inow of funds came essentially from the issue of a debenture bond in the amount of 123.0 million (previous year: 0.0 million) on the one hand and from the taking out and repayment of nancing loans with a bottom-line gure of -30.7 million (previous year: +78.0 million), dividend payments of 36.2 million (previous year: 26.6 million) and pay-

ments for the acquisition of treasury stock in a scope of 31.9 million (previous year: 8.0 million) on the other hand.
1.8. Employees
As an annual average, Drillisch employed a staff of 342, including the two Management Board members (previous year 338). The Company rmly believes that good vocational training is important for the future of young people. In keeping with its convictions, it takes its social responsibility seriously and gives more young people opportunities for vocational training than are required to satisfy its own needs. The number of vocational trainees, which is not included in the above gure, rose to 63 (previous year: 45).
1.9. Principles and objectives of the nancial and capital management
The nancing of the Group is always handled centrally by the parent company Drillisch AG. The top priority of the nancial management at Drillisch is to secure the Company's liquidity at all times. Liquidity reserves are always maintained in such an amount that any and all payment obligations can be met on time. Liquidity is secured on the basis of detailed nancial planning. Business operations are nanced from cash ow and free cash. The Company strives to develop further and to optimise the nancial management continuously.
As a general principle, the company law provisions form the framework of capital management in the Drillisch Group. In cases in which contractual provisions must be observed, equity is managed additionally in accordance with the principles dened in these provisions. In cases in which no special provisions must be observed, the taxable equity is the equity as shown in the balance sheet. Otherwise, the equity from the balance sheet is adjusted according to the contractual requirements. During the reporting period, the Company complied with both company law and contractual provisions at all times.
1.10. Non-nancial performance indicators
In addition to efcient, value-oriented corporate management, the non-nancial performance indicators described below make an important contribution to the success of Drillisch.
Quality of the products: All of the Drillisch Group brands have been awarded an ISO certicate pursuant to DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 for outstanding quality management in the areas of online product marketing and customer service. Nationally and internationally, this is the most widespread and important standard for dening the quality of processes in a company.
Knowledge of the markets: As a consequence of the more than 20 years of activities by Drillisch and its predecessor companies on the wireless services market, the Company has established a position of trust among customers and network providers. This proximity is what enables Drillisch to recognise upcoming trends in good time and to utilise them to raise value. Realising innovative marketing ideas and alternative distribution solutions has repeatedly led to Drillisch's success in offering products

46

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Risk Report

at an early stage which meet the needs of the customers. One important objective is the increase of the subscriber base with long-term value and obtaining a greater market share in the relevant segments.
First-class customer service: Drillisch sets high standards for its own customer service, based on its many years of experience as a wireless services provider. Not content just to maintain these standards, the Company has succeeded in improving them even further through consistent quality management.
Efciency of business processes: Drillisch works constantly on the improvement of efciency in business processes. Measures for the continuous reduction of costs have already led to sustained increases in productivity. In the Company's own estimation, Drillisch is one of the most protable wireless services providers in Germany.
2. Risk report
2.1. Risk management system
The risk management system is an integral component of corporate policy aimed at early exploitation of opportunities as well as the detection and limitation of risks. Drillisch operates a risk management system throughout the Group which includes continuous observation to ensure early recognition and the standardised recording, assessment, control and monitoring of risks. The objective is to obtain information about negative developments and the related nancial effects as early as possible so that the appropriate measures can be initiated to counteract them. The management of the company results and company value makes use of the instruments of risk management. They can become a strategic success factor for corporate management ­ for Drillisch itself as well as for the subsidiaries.
If the Company is to be consistently successful in the conict between opportunities for prot and the threat of loss, risks must be taken into consideration during the decision-making process systematically and in accordance with standards which are uniform throughout the Group. Risk management includes the denition of risk elds, the recording of risks and the communication of risks by the operational units, the assignment of responsibilities and tasks and the documentation of these steps. The concrete implementation of the procedures which have been issued is secured by a monitoring system. The Drillisch risk management process utilises the following building blocks for the exploitation of opportunities without delay and the early discovery of risks:
 The internal controlling system  The daily, weekly and monthly management reporting, especially in the areas
controlling, cash management and the operational business segments  The continuous monitoring of the market
The coordination of risk management is handled at the group level by Group Controlling and Legal. Based on monthly close-outs, the regular comparison of budget and as-is gures as well as market analyses and market observations, opportunities and risks from both operational and strategic areas can be recognised early so that

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

47

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Risk Report

a risk portfolio can be created and implemented in the appropriate measures. Competencies and responsibilities are clearly regulated at Drillisch and are based on the corporate structure of the Drillisch Group. Risk management includes the securing of risks outside of the Group as well. Adequate insurance policies, provided that they are regarded as being economically justiable, have been concluded to cover incidents of loss and liability risks arising in the course of daily business.
The Management Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board are regularly provided with reports on the risk situation and the effectiveness of the risk management system with all of its controlling functions. The results are discussed by both the Management Board and Supervisory Board.
2.2. Description of the major features of the internal controlling and the risk management system with respect to the accounting process (Section 315 (2) HGB)
The internal controlling system in the Drillisch Group includes all of the principles, procedures and measures to secure the effectiveness, correctness and economic efciency of the accounting and to assure compliance with the relevant legal requirements. Besides the manual process controls in the form of the "two sets of eyes principle", automatic IT process checks also form a major part of the integrated controlling measures. The auditor and other auditing bodies are indirectly incorporated into the controlling environment of the Drillisch Group with auditing activities independent of processes. The audit of the separate and consolidated annual accounts and review of the semi-annual reports by the auditor are especially important as major monitoring measures with respect to the accounting process.
The risk management system in Drillisch Group as a component of the internal controlling system is oriented to the risk of incorrect representation by the bookkeeping and the external reporting possible in the accounting. A "monitoring system for the early recognition of risks threatening the Company's existence" has been set up in Drillisch Group to ensure the systematic early detection of risks throughout the Group so that, going beyond the scope originally required by statutory provisions, other risks as well as those threatening the existence of the rm are detected early, controlled and monitored. In accordance with Section 317 (4) HGB, the auditor appraises the functional capability of the system for the early detection of risks, which is adapted without delay to any and all changes in the environment. The bookkeeping software from the manufacturer Sage is used for the posting of accounting items in Drillisch Group, while the consolidation software from the manufacturer Infor Global Solutions is used at the Group level.
Risks related to accounting can arise from the conclusion of unusual or complex transactions, for example. Moreover, business transactions which are not handled as a matter of routine include a latent risk. The measures of the internal controlling system oriented to the correctness of the accounting ensure that all of the business transactions are recorded completely and contemporaneously in conformity with legal and statutory requirements. Furthermore, there is the assurance that assets and debts are correctly measured, appraised and shown in the annual accounts.
The controlling activities include the analysis of material circumstances and developments, for example, using special indicator systems. The organisational separation of

48

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Risk Report
administrative, executive, billing and approval functions signicantly reduce vulnerability to fraud. The internal controlling system also assures the representation of changes in the economic or legal environment of the Drillisch Group and ensues the application of any new or amended legal provisions for the accounting.
2.3. Market-related risks The major overall risks related to the market are as follows:
 Drillisch operates in a market environment which is by and large saturated and consequently highly competitive. Substantial increases in overall turnover cannot be expected on the German wireless services market in 2013.
 Drillisch may possibly not be successful in acquiring and maintaining a satisfactory share of this market.
 The increasing availability of low-cost rates and products may cause the prices which can be charged for wireless services to decline.
 A decline in prices on the market for wireless services or the reduction in the forwarding charges could result in falling sales and income.
 The expenditures required to acquire new customers and retain the loyalty of current customers are comparatively high, especially in the segment of xed-term contracts. These expenditures may continue to rise in the future.
 Drillisch is subject to regulatory restraints in its business activities. These general conditions may change and could impact business.
 Wireless services providers are dependent on network operators in offering their products and services because they do not have their own network.
2.4. Company-specic risk factors The major risks specic to Drillisch are as follows:
 The net nancial debt of Drillisch could increase, e.g. as a consequence of the takeover of companies, leading to a worsening of the nancial results and the equity ratio. This could have a long-term effect on the Company's ability to pay dividends and to take out new loans.
 Risks which affect the assets and liabilities, the nancial position or prot and loss of freenet or the value of its stock could also inuence Drillisch owing to its holdings of freenet stock. During the acquisition of the shares in freenet, Drillisch was dependent on documentation which was available to the general public. If this information should prove to be incorrect or incomplete, Drillisch may be exposed to unknown threats.
 The freenet holdings of Drillisch and MSP lead to a book value of the shares which must be reviewed regularly with regard to their value. The review can lead to extraordinary write-offs both in the consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS and in the separate annual accounts in accordance with HGB.

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

49

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT
Risk Report
 A loan agreement which Drillisch has concluded contains obligations which could restrict the entrepreneurial exibility of Drillisch. However, this loan had not been utilised per 31 December 2012.
 Credit lines which had not been utilised per 31 December 2012 are subject in part to variable interest rates. This could result in a threat from changes in interest rates if and when these lines are utilised.
 The maintenance of the functional capability and the regular evolvement of the software systems used by the Company, which it has in part developed itself, for the administration of the customers and the billing of performed services is of decisive importance for the success of Drillisch. Software errors can cause disruptions in the program execution, in extreme cases causing a permanent crash of the software and the loss of data, and prevent the Company from developing and offering new wireless service products within a short period of time.
 Drillisch is dependent on network operators in offering its products and services because it does not have its own network.
 Drillisch is subject to the risk that contract customers will not meet their payment obligations under their wireless service contracts.
 Drillisch is highly dependent on members of the Management Board and on employees in key positions.
There were no major changes in the risk situation in 2012 in comparison with the previous year with the exception of the resolved legal disputes with Telekom Deutschland GmbH. The risks described here are the major risks which have been identied at this time. The possibility that additional major risks which have not been recognised by management exist or that the probability of the occurrence of such risks has been wrongly assessed as negligible cannot be excluded. Adequate precautions have been taken to counter any probable risks. There are at this time no known risks which would threaten the Company's existence.

Prediction Report

3. Forecast report
This report contains certain statements oriented to the future which are based on the current assumptions and projections of the Company's management. Various risks, uncertainties and other factors, both known and unknown, can cause the actual results, nancial position, development or performance of the Company to deviate substantially from the assessment shown here.
3.1. General economic conditions
In the opinion of the German government and the great majority of the most important economic research institutes, the economic upswing in Germany is not yet at an end. Owing to continuing uncertainty caused by the nancial and government debt crisis and the darkening of the economic situation in Europe and other international areas, however, Dr Philipp Rösler, German Federal Economics Minister, assumes that the momentary phase of weakness will not be overcome until some point during the course of 2013 and presumes economic growth in Germany in 2013 will be slightly lower than in 2012. The Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK) expects economic growth of about 0.8% for 2013. This forecast is in line with the development of the IFO business climate index. Further events related to the European crisis of trust and government debt will continue to have a decisive impact on further economic developments. Thanks to the domestic German economy, which remains very healthy, real economic development in Germany is remarkably resilient.
3.2. Drillisch Management Board projections regarding the development on the German wireless services market
The Drillisch Management Board expects the telecommunications and IT markets in Germany to continue to serve as important innovation drivers for the German economy. However, there will presumably not be any signicant growth in revenues in the telecommunications industry because, although usage is increasing, the price sensitivity will remain at the same level. Moreover, the reduction in the forwarding charges from December 2012 will, as an overall effect, remove revenues in a signicant volume from the market. The most important growth segment in telecommunications will continue to be mobile data communications. Moreover, the displacement of the landline network by wireless services will continue.
3.3. Opportunities and risks of future development
Simple means for making phone calls and "surng" at low prices will remain the focus of interest for wireless services customers. The virtually full-area availability of mobile high-speed Internet, the accelerating spread of smartphones and services such as "near-eld" and "machine-to-machine communication" justify expectations for continued high growth rates in the use of mobile data communications. The greatest growth in turnover and growth potential are predicted for this segment of the wireless services market. Drillisch intends to make use of its customer-friendly portfolio to prot from this development. The Management Board does not expect an increase in sales in the "service revenues" in 2013 because of the reduction in the

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

51

CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT

Compensation Report

forwarding charges. But at the same time, this reduction will cause costs to decline and have a positive effect on gross prot. By increasing the MVNO clientele, Drillisch will seek to continue the parallel positive earnings development in operating business. The Management Board expects an EBITDA (adjusted) in the telecommunications segment of between 67 million and 70 million in 2013 and of between 77 million and 80 million in 2014. The other segments have only a negligible impact on the (adjusted) EBITDA.
4. Compensation report
The structure of the compensation system for the Management Board is determined by the Supervisory Board. The criteria for the reasonableness of the compensation include in particular the duties and responsibilities of each of the Management Board members; their personal performance; the performance of the Management Board as a whole; and the economic position, the success and the future prospects of the Company, taking into account its comparative environment. The compensation for the Management Board members comprises short-term components and factors with long-term incentive components. The short-term components consist of elements independent of success and elements contingent on success. The elements independent of success comprise xed compensation as well as payment in kind and other benets. The xed compensation as basic compensation independent of success is paid monthly as a salary and reviewed annually. In addition, the Management Board members receive other benets, in particular allowances for pension, health and long-term care insurance, as well as payments in kind (essentially the use of the company car). The Management Board's compensation always includes variable compensation elements which are components contingent on success. These elements are redened every year by the Supervisory Board on the basis of targets.
In 2011, the Supervisory Board concluded an agreement with both Management Board members providing for a "Long-Term Incentive Bonus" (LTI) with a term of ve years as a long-term incentive component. The parameter for determining success is the consolidated EBITDA. In the event of premature termination of the employment relationship within the agreed term, each of the Management Board members will receive a predetermined amount based on the point in time at which he leaves the Company's service.
The term of the contracts with the Management Board expires on 31 December 2015. The Management Board contracts do not contain any express commitments for severance pay ­ with the exception of the following regulation for a change of control clause ­ in the event that the employment relationship is terminated. In the event that Drillisch experiences a change in the shareholder structure of more than 30% (change of control), a part of the compensation independent of success and a part of the merit-based compensation will be deemed earned. The Management Board members receive total compensation of 20k for their Supervisory Board activities at IQ-optimize and eteleon. The Management Board members did not receive any loans or advance payments in the reporting period. No pension commitments have been made to the Management Board.

Contributions of 230k for each Management Board member are paid annually into a pension fund as deferred compensation.
The long-term variable compensation contains an incentive component of 275k for each Management Board member; it will not be paid unless certain performance indicators are achieved in scal year 2016.
The members of the Supervisory Board receive reasonable compensation for each full scal year of their participation in the Supervisory Board; the amount is specied in the company charter. The chairperson receives twice the amount, while the deputy chairperson receives 2k in addition to the regular compensation. Furthermore, attendance fees per meeting and Supervisory Board member are paid if and when the number of meetings exceeds that stipulated in Section 110 (3) AktG. Supervisory Board members who did not belong to the Supervisory Board during the full scal year receive pro rata temporis compensation according to the duration of their membership on the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board members also receive variable compensation. The variable compensation for all Supervisory Board members is dependent on the distributed dividend per share which exceeds 0.10 in dividend per share. However, the variable compensation for each Supervisory Board member may not exceed the amount of the xed compensation which the relevant Supervisory Board member receives. One-quarter of the xed compensation is payable upon the expiration of each and every quarter. The attendance fees as accrued are payable upon the expiration of each and every quarter. The variable compensation is payable on the day after the adjournment of the Annual General Meeting which adopts a resolution regarding the appropriation of the retained earnings for the scal year for which the compensation is owed. The Supervisory Board members are also reimbursed for all of their expenses and for any turnover tax which must be paid on their compensation and expenses.

The subscribed capital before stock repurchase amounts to 58,507,916.50 and is distributed in 53,189,015 no-par shares issued to the bearer with a proportionate share in the share capital of 1.10. Each share is the equivalent of one vote. The securitisation of the stock is excluded.
The Company was not notied of any direct and indirect holding of stock greater than 10%.
In accordance with Sections 84, 85 AktG in conjunction with Section 7 of the company charter, the Management Board is appointed and recalled by the Supervisory Board. Any amendments to the company charter must be adopted in conformity with legal statutes (Sections 179 et seqq. AktG) by the Annual General Meeting. Moreover, the Supervisory Board is authorised to amend the company charter if and when such amendments affect only the wording.
The Annual General Meeting of 30 May 2008 authorised the Management Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the Company's share capital by as much as 29,253,957.70 by a single or multiple issue of new shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind before the lapse of 29 May 2013 (approved capital). In the event of cash contributions, the new shares may also be taken over by one or more banks, subject to the obligation to offer them for purchase to the shareholders (indirect subscription right).

However, the Management Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights
 so that fractional amounts are excluded from the subscription right;

Supplemental Information in Accordance with Section 315, Subsection 4 HGB
 if the capital increase is achieved by cash contributions and the issue price of the new shares is not signicantly lower than that of the equivalent shares already traded on the exchange at the time of the nal determination of the issue price by the Management Board. The number of shares issued subject to exclusion of the subscription pursuant to Section 186 (3), fourth sentence AktG (German Company Law) may not exceed 10% of the share capital ­ neither at the point in time at which the authorisation becomes effective nor at the point in time that it is exercised. Any shares which have been issued or must be issued to satisfy subscription rights from options or convertible bonds, provided that the debenture bonds have been issued during the term of this authorisation subject to application mutatis mutandis of Section 186 (3) fourth sentence AktG and excluding the subscription right, must be included in this gure. Furthermore, any shares which are issued or sold, subject to the exclusion of a subscription right, during the term of this authorisation on the basis of an authorisation for the use of treasury stock in accordance with Section 71 (1) no. 8 and Section 186 (3) fourth sentence AktG must be included in this gure;
 if the capital increase against contributions in kind is carried out for the purpose of providing shares within the framework of corporate mergers or of acquiring companies or parts of companies, holdings in companies or other assets;
 so that new shares up to a proportionate amount of the share capital totalling 2,925,395.00 may be issued as staff shares to employees of the Company or of afliated companies within the sense of Section 15 et seqq. AktG.
Furthermore, the Management Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further content of the stock rights and the terms and conditions of the issue of the shares. The Supervisory Board is authorised to amend the current version of the company charter in accordance with the specic utilisation of the approved capital or after the expiration of the authorisation. The Annual General Meeting on 28 May 2010 adopted a resolution authorising the Drillisch AG Management Board to acquire treasury stock totalling up to 10% of the share capital at the time of the Annual General Meeting 2010 on or before 27 May 2015. Pursuant to this authorisation, the Management Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, resolved on 13 September 2012 to initiate another share repurchase programme with an upper threshold of 3,792,118 shares. In combination with the treasury stock of 1,526,783 shares already held at that time, the total holdings of own shares would be 10% of the present share capital. A total of 4,482,501 shares were purchased at an average price of 8.88 during scal years 2011 and 2012, corresponding to about 8.43% of the Drillisch AG share capital. The Company has concluded a number of agreements in which a change of control as a consequence of a takeover represents a condition precedent. These are primarily agreements with the network operators. Furthermore, the occurrence of a so-called "change of control" can affect the nancing of the Company.

Consolidated Notes

To the extent discernible today, no signicant effects on the consolidated annual accounts are to be expected from the new regulations (with the exception of the amendment to IAS 19 related to the equity holding in freenet AG). Depending on the actuarial gains and losses of the pension provisions at freenet AG, there can be a non-operating increase or decrease in the equity of Drillisch Group.
C. Consolidation
Consolidation principles and consolidated companies
Business combinations are measured according to the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the identied assets and liabilities of the acquired subsidiary. The value relationships at the point in time at which the control over the subsidiary is obtained are authoritative. Measurable assets and the assumed liabilities are valued at their full fair value, regardless of the amount of the participation. Any remaining positive difference is shown as goodwill. A negative difference which remains is included as directly effective on income. The disclosed hidden reserves and hidden encumbrances are carried forward to the following periods in the same way as the handling of the corresponding assets and liabilities, written off as scheduled or reversed.
Joint ventures and interests which are unilaterally controlled are included in accordance with the equity method. The balance sheets for these companies are prepared with their identied, proportionate assets which have been revaluated (plus any goodwill) and liabilities in one item. The goodwill derived during the application of the equity method is not written off as scheduled depreciation, but it is reviewed at least once a year for any signs of a decrease in value. The equity measurement is always updated by the proportionate period results. Prots and losses from business transactions with these companies are eliminated proportionately.
Consistent accounting and valuation methods are applied to the separate accounts included in the consolidated annual accounts of Drillisch AG.
All of the receivables and payables as well as income and expenditures among the companies included in the consolidated annual accounts are eliminated, as are interim results.
The parent company´s annual accounts as well as those of all of the important subsidiaries controlled by the former, whether directly or indirectly, were included in the consolidated annual accounts of Drillisch AG per 31 December 2012. There is control of a company if the parent company, legally or de facto, has the opportunity to determine the nancial and business policies of a company with the aim of obtaining economic benets.
The initial inclusion in the consolidated annual accounts takes place at the point in time from which control can be exercised or at which the criteria for joint ventures and associated companies are fullled. Companies which are not included are singly and in their totality of only minor importance, both from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, and the balance sheets are prepared in accordance with IAS 39.

Drillisch Telecom GmbH, Maintal The merger of the subsidiary Simply Communication GmbH with Drillisch Telekom GmbH was entered in the Commercial Register on 24 August 2012, effective retroactively to 1 January 2012.
freenet AG, Büdelsdorf As of 31 December 2012, Drillisch AG held a total of 8,866,658 shares in freenet AG. The combined holdings in freenet AG stock of Drillisch AG and MSP Holding GmbH amounted to 26,686,658 shares per 31 December 2012, corresponding to a share in the freenet AG capital of 20.84%. The fair value per share of freenet AG stock per 31 December 2012 amounted to 14.00, while the book value per share came to 9.73.
D. General accounting and evaluation methods
Realisation of income and expenses In the telecommunications segment, sales are generated from the offered wireless services, one-time installation charges and from the sale of mobile end devices and accessories. Sales from wireless services include monthly service charges, charges for special features and connection and roaming charges. Sales from wireless services are realised on the basis of utilisation units which have been used and contractual charges, less credit notes and adjustments due to price discounts. The turnover generated from the sale of mobile telephones, mobile data devices and accessories and the related expenses are realised as soon as the products are delivered and accepted by the customers.
Some of the end customer contracts are multiple-component contracts. In the case of multiple-component contracts, the revenue must be recognised for each of the separately identiable components. Agreements for the sale of bundled products or

66

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes
the performance of bundled services must be broken down into their separate components and a separate contribution to earnings must be recognised for each component. If wireless services rate plans include the provision of a wireless device, the revenue is realised on the basis of the fair value of the individual components. The price for the multiple-component transaction in its entirety is distributed among the various components on the basis of the proportionate fair value (i.e. the fair value of each separate component is set in ratio to the fair value of the bundled services as a whole). With respect to wireless services rate plans mediated by third parties, the proportionate fair value of a single component and therefore the realised revenue for this component is recognised separately from that part of the consideration to be paid by the customer for the multiple-component transaction in its entirety independently of the performance of further services. For this reason, the outstanding basic fees for these wireless services rate plans proportionately attributable to the wireless device are allocated to this device.
In the segment software services, sales are generated from the offered customised software solutions and from maintenance and support services. Sales from software solutions and sales from maintenance and support services are based on contractual provisions.
The interest in freenet AG is presented in the segment Equity interest. freenet AG is presented in the consolidated annual accounts in accordance with the equity method and the result is disclosed in the Results from nancial assets shown in the balance sheet in accordance with the equity method.
Operating expenditures are recorded as expenses when the service is used or at the point in time they are caused.
Interest expenses are recorded appropriately for the period in consideration of the outstanding loan total and the effective interest rate which is applicable. The effective interest rate is the interest rate which results in the cash value of the estimated future payments over the expected useful life of the nancial asset being the equivalent of the net book value. Dividend income from nancial investments is recorded when a legal claim to payment arises.
Intangible assets Intangible xed assets are shown in the balance sheet at acquisition or manufacturing costs, less scheduled depreciation calculated according to the straight-line method. A useful life of three to ve years is taken as the basis. The manufacturing costs include overhead costs as well as the immediately attributable direct costs.
Intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life are not written off according to a schedule, but are instead subjected to a recoverability test once a year and, in addition, whenever there are indications of a decrease in value; as appropriate, this is based on entities which generate cash. If the book value of the intangible asset or of the cash-generating entity on which it is based exceeds the recoverable value, the asset must be written off to the recoverable amount.

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

67

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes

If the reasons for the previously recorded devaluations cease to exist, the assets are written up without goodwill.
In accordance with IFRS, there has no longer been any scheduled depreciation of goodwill since scal year 2005. The goodwill is reviewed annually to determine any loss of value.
Within the framework of the review of loss of value, the goodwill acquired during a corporate merger is allocated to the cash-generating entities which will presumably prot from the assets which determine the value, but cannot be measured. The recoverability test is conducted once a year and, in addition, whenever there are indications for a loss of value in the corresponding cash-generating entity. If the book value of the cash-generating entity exceeds its recoverable value, the goodwill allocated to this cash-generating entity must be written off in the amount of the difference; devaluations are not reversed in this case.
The recoverable value for a cash-generating entity which corresponds to the legal entity is calculated on the basis of its use value. The use value is determined by application of the DCF procedure. The calculations are based on projections resulting from nancial plans approved by management and are also used for internal purposes.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are evaluated at acquisition costs less scheduled straight-line depreciation. The depreciation period for xtures, ttings and equipment varies between two and nineteen years. Additions during the scal year are written off pro rata temporis. Borrowing costs are measured in the period in which they are incurred as expenditures because there are no qualifying assets in accordance with IAS 23.5.
Financial instruments
A nancial instrument is a contract which simultaneously leads to the creation of a nancial asset for one company and to the creation of a nancial liability or equity instrument for another company. Financial instruments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the point in time at which a consolidated company becomes the party of the nancial instrument. However, the day of performance is relevant in the case of purchases and sales usual on the market for the initial inclusion in and the removal from the balance sheet.
A nancial asset is derecognised when the conditions of IAS 39.17­39.18 have been fullled. If the Group assigns its contractual rights to payment ows from an asset and retains essentially all of the threats and opportunities related to the ownership of this asset, the Group continues to record the assigned asset in the scope of its ongoing commitment.
Financial assets include in particular cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, nancial assets available for sale and loans and receivables and derivative nancial assets maintained for commercial purposes. Financial liabilities include trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, liabilities from nancing leasing relationships and derivative nancial liabilities. Financial assets and nancial liabilities are shown as

68

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes

balances only if there is an offset right with respect to the amounts and the intention is to realise a balance on a net basis.
Financial instruments are measured at fair value when recognised for the rst time. The transaction expenses which are directly attributable to the acquisition must be taken into account for all of the nancial assets and liabilities which are subsequently valued at the attributable market value without effect on income. The attributable market values measured in the balance sheet correspond as a rule to the market prices of the nancial assets and liabilities.
The subsequent valuation depends on whether a nancial instrument is held for commercial purposes or until its nal maturity, whether it is available for sale or whether it comprises loans and receivables of the company. Financial instruments held for commercial purposes are valuated at the fair value with effect on income. If it is intended, and can also from a commercial standpoint be expected with reasonable condence, that the nancial instruments will be held until their nal maturity, they are valuated in accordance with the effective rate of return method with the acquisition costs carried forward. All other original nancial assets, unless they are loans and receivables, must be classied as available for sale and valuated at fair value. This value is determined on the basis of market prices (exchange prices). The prots and losses resulting from the valuation at fair value are included in shareholders' equity as non-operating results. This does not apply if there are permanent or major losses in value of nancial instruments. When the nancial instruments are derecognised, the cumulative prots and losses recorded in shareholders' equity are shown in the income statement effective on income.
When nancial instruments measured as available for sale are reclassied for measurement in accordance with the equity method, any market valuation provisions are reversed as operating results.
Other nancial assets
Other nancial assets are always measured at acquisition costs less required valuation allowances.
Inventories
The inventories, comprising solely and exclusively merchandise and payments on account, are measured at the lower of acquisition costs or realisable net sales value. The measurement of the merchandise is based on the FIFO principle.
Receivables and other assets
Receivables and other assets were measured at nominal value in the balance sheet. Valuation allowances were created for default risks. Receivables and liabilities related to the network operators Telekom, Vodafone, E-Plus and O are shown in the
2
balance sheet as balances in each case. Any receivables which result from the calculation of the balance are shown in the other current assets, liabilities under the trade accounts payable.

Liabilities Financial liabilities are shown at acquisition costs carried forward in accordance with IAS 39. Directly attributable issue costs are deducted when the nancial liabilities are taken out and distributed with effect on earnings over the entire term.
Leases Leases are classied, pursuant to IAS 17, as nance leases if and when essentially all of the threats and opportunities associated with the ownership of the leased object are transferred to the lessee. Any other leases are to be classied as operating leases.
Assets held within the framework of nance leases are capitalised at the beginning of the lease at their fair value or, if it is lower, at the cash value of the minimum leasing instalments, then written off according to straight-line depreciation. The corresponding liability to the lessor is shown in the balance sheet as obligation from nance lease. The leasing instalments are allocated proportionately to nancing expenses and reduction in the lease obligation so that over the periods a constant interest rate on the remaining balance of the obligations is created for each reporting period. Rent payments from operating leases are recorded according to the straightline method as operating results over the term of the pertinent lease.
Pension provisions Pension provisions for merit-based pension commitments are determined actuarially according to the projected unit credit method and shown in the balance sheet on the basis of an assessor's valuation on the balance sheet date.
The pension commitments shown in the balance sheet represent the cash value of the merit-based commitment adjusted for the service period expenses which are to be offset retroactively and for actuarial prots and losses, less the fair value of the scheme assets. Actuarial prots and losses are taken into account and allocated to the average future remaining service period solely to the extent that they exceed a corridor corresponding to 10% of the scope of the obligation or the market value of the scheme assets, whichever is higher.
Short-term provisions Provisions are created for a legal or de facto obligation which originated in the past if it is probable that the fullment of the obligation will result in an outow of Group resources and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Deferred taxes Deferred taxes are shown according to the liability method for all temporary differences between the tax value measurements and the book values. The tax rates which will presumably apply at the point in time of the reversal of the temporary differences are applied. Deferred taxes are not created if the temporary difference results from goodwill.

Consolidated Notes
Deferred taxes are shown as tax revenue or expenses in the income statement unless they directly affect items included in shareholders' equity as non-operating results; in this case, the deferred taxes are also shown as non-operating results in shareholders' equity.
Long-term incentive components The variable compensation paid to the Management Board contains a long-term incentive component which will not be paid out unless specic indicators are fullled in scal year 2016. A provision has been created on the basis of the fair value.
Usage of assumptions and estimates During the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts, assumptions were made and estimates applied which affected the disclosure and measurement of the assets, liabilities, earnings, expenditures and contingent liabilities shown in the balance sheet. These assumptions and estimates are related primarily to the determination of commercial lifetimes used as a standard throughout the Group, the assumptions concerning the recoverability of goodwill, brand rights, receivables and investments, the valuation of provisions and the realisability of future tax relief. The actual values may, in individual cases, deviate from the assumptions and estimates which have been made, especially with respect to dividend returns, interest rates and volatilities. Any changes will be given due consideration with effect on the results whenever more precise knowledge becomes available. Estimates are necessary especially in measuring the goodwill in the balance sheet and its recoverability tests, in determining the interest factor for calculation of the pension provisions and the valuation of other provisions when showing them in the balance sheet. The Drillisch Group has a key approach of nancial risk management for the identication, measurement and control of risks. The risk items are derived from the income and expenditures affecting payments which are undertaken and planned throughout the Group.

The additions of the own produced software are related to the software developed by IQ-optimize AG and used by the Company.
The additions in purchased software/licences essentially relate to investments made in the expansion of the MVNO business model.
During the purchase price allocation process for Telco GmbH in 2007 and eteleon esolutions AG in 2009, customer relationships, own produced software and the trademarks Telco and eteleon were recognised. The trademarks are intangible assets with an unlimited useful life. Based on the analysis of the relevant factors (planning related to the future use of the asset, expected market behaviour, and so on), there is no foreseeable limitation to the periods in which the trademarks will presumably generate net cash ows.

With the exception of IQ-optimize AG, the goodwill has been allocated to the telecommunications segment.
The acquisition costs and the accrued depreciation as well as the resulting book values did not change in comparison with the previous year.
The value of the goodwill was reviewed using the amounts realisable for these cashgenerating entities, calculated on the basis of their utilisation values. The utilisation values result from the future cash ows, including interest. The company planning approved by management for the years 2013 to 2017 and for the time after that is based on a sustained net prot at a constant growth rate of 0.5% (previous year: 0.5%) derived from the budgetary gures for 2017. The budget presumes average growth in gross prot for Drillisch Telecom GmbH and IQ-optimize AG in the lower single-digit percentage range for this period. Average growth in gross prot which barely breaks into the two-digit percentage range at the end of the budgetary scope is expected for eteleon e-solutions AG owing to the expansion of the business model. The major assumption for the planning of the cash-generating entities is the number of subscribers. Discounting on the cash ows for the period 2013 to 2017 was calculated at an interest rate of 10.76% (previous year: 11.38%) and for the following period at an interest rate of 10.26% (previous year: 10.88%) p.a. (in each case, before taxes). No adjustments in the value of the goodwill were required in scal year 2012. There was no value reduction in goodwill from a reduction of the discount interest rate by about 1% and in consideration of a lump-sum deduction of 25% from the expected cash ow.

12. Financial assets shown in balance sheet according to equity method
The freenet shares held by MSP Holding GmbH and Drillisch AG since 14 June 2011 have been valuated according to the equity method because of the unilateral control over the company from the voting rights quota. The results from this inclusion amounted to 54.3 million per 31 December 2012 (previous year: 28.3 million). In the previous year, the results from nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method also included income from the reversal of the market valuation provision. The transition from a classication as "available for sale" to the equity method valuation resulted in the reversal of the market valuation provision as operating results.
Moreover, the share of the updating of the proportional equity of freenet AG as operating results in the amount of 38.0 million (previous year: 19.9 million) is included in the "Results from the nancial assets shown in the balance sheet according to the equity method". The holding was classied as "Available for sale" in accordance with IAS 39 until 14 June 2011 and was disclosed in the item Other nancial assets.

With respect to the receivables which as of the closing date had not been devaluated and which were not overdue, nothing was known as of the closing date which would indicate that the debtors would not full their payment obligations.
Receivables which as of the closing date were not devaluated, but which were overdue, comprise receivables due from customers and suppliers with whom payment in instalments in the amount of 188k has been agreed. As long as these debtors full their payment obligations, there will not be any valuation allowances and the receivables will continue to be measured at acquisition costs.
In the Drillisch Group, valuation allowances are created on doubtful receivables to take into account estimated losses which result from customers' insolvency. The criteria used by management for the assessment of the reasonableness of the valuation allowances for doubtful receivables are the maturity structure of the receivable balances and experience related to the write-offs of receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers and the changes in terms and conditions of payment. If the customers' nancial position deteriorates, the scope of the write-offs which must actually be taken can exceed the scope of the expected write-offs.
The valuation allowances on trade receivables have developed as shown below:

Treasury stock The Annual General Meeting on 28 May 2010 adopted a resolution authorising the Drillisch AG Management Board to acquire treasury stock totalling up to 10% of the share capital at the time of the Annual General Meeting 2010 (5,318,901 shares) on or before 27 May 2015. In scal year 2012, this repurchase right was exercised and 3,195,910 own shares were purchased on the stock exchange at an average price of 9.97, corresponding to about 6% of the Drillisch AG share capital. 1.10 of the purchase price per share was attributed to subscribed capital. The surplus amount was deducted from the capital surplus. Per 31 December 2012, Drillisch AG held 4,482,501 own shares representing about 8.43% of the share capital. The acquisition of treasury stock serves the purpose of using this stock for the nancing of possible acquisitions of companies or parts of companies, of holdings in companies or of other assets or of activities related to corporate mergers. Nor is a later redemption or resale of these shares to third parties against cash payment excluded.
Capital surplus The capital surplus contains the premium over the nominal amount from the issue of shares by Drillisch AG. The amount required for the purchase of treasury stock in excess of the par value of 1.10 was deducted from the capital surplus.
Earnings reserves The earnings reserves contain the prots realised in the past by the companies included in the consolidated annual accounts which were not distributed or carried forward to a new account from a Group perspective.
Non-controlling shareholders The item of non-controlling shareholders is related to third-party shares at eteleon e-solutions AG up to the time of the transfer of the shares to Drillisch AG on 16 August 2011.
Approved capital The Annual General Meeting of 30 May 2008 authorised the Management Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the Company's share capital by as much as 29,253,957.70 by a single or multiple issue of new shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind before the lapse of 29 May 2013 (approved capital). In the event of cash contributions, the new shares may also be taken over by one or more banks, subject to the obligation to offer them for purchase to the shareholders (indirect subscription right). On principle, a subscription right is to be granted to the shareholders. However, the Management Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights

 so that fractional amounts are excluded from the subscription right;  if the capital increase is achieved by cash contributions and the issue price of the
new shares is not signicantly lower than that of the equivalent shares already traded on the exchange at the time of the nal determination of the issue price by the Management Board. The number of shares issued subject to exclusion of the subscription pursuant to Section 186 (3), fourth sentence AktG (German Company Law) may not exceed 10% of the share capital, neither at the point in time at which the authorisation becomes effective nor at the point in time that it is exercised. Any shares which have been issued or must be issued to satisfy subscription rights from options or convertible bonds, provided that the debenture bonds have been issued during the term of this authorisation subject to application mutatis mutandis of Section 186 (3) fourth sentence AktG and excluding the subscription right, must be included in this gure. Furthermore, any shares which are issued or sold, subject to the exclusion of a subscription right, during the term of this authorisation on the basis of an authorisation for the use of treasury stock in accordance with Section 71 (1) (8) and Section 186 (3) (4) AktG must be included in this gure;  If the capital increase against contributions in kind is carried out for the purpose of providing shares within the framework of corporate mergers or of acquiring companies or parts of companies, holdings in companies or other assets;  so that new shares up to a proportionate amount of the share capital totalling 2,925,395.00 may be issued as staff shares to employees of the Company or of afliated companies within the sense of Section 15 et seqq. AktG.
Furthermore, the Management Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further content of the stock rights and the terms and conditions of the issue of the shares. The Supervisory Board is authorised to amend the current version of the company charter in accordance with the specic utilisation of the approved capital or after the expiration of the authorisation.

19. Pension provisions

Provisions are created for commitments from pension expectancies to present and former employees or their survivors.
Pension provisions are shown in the balance sheet and measured in accordance with IAS 19. The future commitments are valuated by applying actuarial procedures and using prudent estimates of the relevant inuential variables. The company pension plan in the Group is merit-based and as a rule depends on the time of service to the Company and the compensation paid to the employees.
The following calculation parameters are used in addition to the assumptions about life expectancy:

Calculation parameters
Calculated interest rate Expected income from scheme assets Expected development of income Expected development of pensions Fluctuation

2012
% 3.46 2.50 0.00 0.00 0.00

2011
% 5.17 2.50 0.00 0.00 0.00

The pension provisions are always valuated by applying the 10% corridor rule. Actuarial prots or losses are not considered with effects on income provided that they do not exceed 10% of the higher of the scope of the commitments or market value of the scheme assets. Any amount exceeding this corridor is distributed with effect on income over the average remaining time of service of present employees. The scheme assets represent a pension plan reinsurance which has been pledged to the employees.
The reference tables 2005 G from Klaus Heubeck were used for the biometrical basis of the calculations. The uctuation probability was estimated specically to age and sex.
The income expected from the scheme assets was determined essentially on the basis of the development of the reinsurance policy in the past.

No contributions will be made to the reinsurance in scal year 2013.
The scheme assets comprise exclusively a reinsurance policy.
Schemes oriented to contributions exist as well. This does not result in any obligations for Drillisch AG beyond the payment of the contributions to external institutes. The expenditures for the funding of these contribution-oriented schemes in the scal year amounted to 1.6m (previous year: 1.4m).

20. Bank loans and overdrafts / Financial liabilities / Debenture bond
Bank loans and overdrafts
A loan agreement for a total of 100m was agreed between the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt, and the West LB AG, Düsseldorf, as the arrangers and Drillisch AG on 15 October 2010. The loan was divided into a bullet loan (40m) and revolving loan (60m). The bullet loan was completely repaid in scal year 2012. The revolving loan was reduced to 50m in December 2012; per 31 December 2012, this credit line had not been utilised. Utilisation per 31 December 2011 totalled 60m. The interest rate comprises two components: the EURIBOR applicable to the relevant interest period and a margin agreed in the loan agreement. Per 31 December 2012, the combined interest rate would have amounted to 1.64% (previous year: 2.41%). The loan agreement runs until 15 October 2014. Any utilised amounts must be repaid at the end of the term at the latest; interim obligatory repayments have not been agreed. Voluntary premature amortisation is possible at any time.
The applicable margin is adjusted quarterly and oriented to the ratio of consolidated net nancial debt to consolidated EBITDA on the basis of the 12 months previous to the relevant quarterly closing date. The minimum margin was 1.10% for the bullet loan and 1.25% for the revolving loan and will be applied if the ratio of consolidated net nancial debt to consolidated EBITDA is less than 1 to 1. If this ratio is greater than

88

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes

2 to 1, the maximum possible margins of 2.10% and 2.25%, respectively, will apply.
The one-off bank charges of 950k due and payable when the loan became available at the commencement of the term will be set off according to the effective interest method and distributed per schedule over the term.
Drillisch AG pledged 2.5 million shares of the freenet stock it holds directly as security for the loan. This security was released in full when the bullet loan was repaid and the revolving loan was reduced.
The loan is tied to specic nancial indicators (degree of indebtedness and equity ratio); in the event of failure to comply with these indicators, the loan agreement may be terminated. The Company was consistently in compliance with these criteria throughout scal year 2012.
The interest expenses related to the loans amounted to 446k in scal year 2012 (previous year 1,592k).
MSP Holding GmbH concluded nancing transactions with the Bank of America N.A. (BANA) in the amounts of 31.1m and 58.6m on 11 February 2011 and 3 May 2011, respectively; the funds were used for the acquisition of shares in freenet AG. Each of these nancing transactions consists of three partial amounts ("buckets") which must be repaid with due dates in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. There will not be any interest payments during the terms.
MSP Holding GmbH concluded a further nancing transaction with BANA in the amount of 46.8m on 4 April 2012 for the acquisition of additional shares in freenet AG; it also consists of three buckets which must be repaid in 2016, 2017 and 2018. There will not be any interest payments during the term of this loan, either.
The interest expenses related to the nancing transactions will be provided in the form of ratable discounting until the time of the repayment. Voluntary premature amortisation is possible at any time.
The interest expenses related to the nancing transactions amounted to 4,594k in scal year 2012 (previous year 2,513k).
The structuring fee of 600k incurred with the nancing transaction in 2011 will be distributed per schedule according to the effective interest method over the term.
MSP Holding GmbH has pledged 17.8 million shares of the freenet stock it holds directly as security for the loan. As of the closing date, the security had a book value of 173.5m (fair value: 249.5m). There are no other securities. There is no risk of Drillisch AG becoming liable for the loan liabilities assumed by MSP because they are "nonrecourse nancing" transactions.
Financial liabilities
The long-term nancial liabilities essentially comprise the closing date measurement of hedging transactions which were concluded in the course of nancing the acquisition of freenet stock by MSP Holding GmbH in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, the nancial liabilities include nancial derivatives from the issue of the non-subordinate debenture bonds vested with the right to convert to current registered shares of equity stock

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

89

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Consolidated Notes

in freenet AG. The value of these hedging transactions and nancial derivatives is recalculated as of every closing date and is primarily a result of the price of the freenet stock on the closing date and of the remaining term. A rising stock price tends to lead to a declining value, Since the security transactions and nancial derivatives do not meet the requirements of a hedging pursuant to IAS 39, these nance instruments are measured separately as operating results.
The short-term nancial liabilities include interest liabilities from the issue of the nonsubordinate debenture bonds vested with the right to convert to current registered shares of equity stock in freenet AG.
Debenture bonds
On 5 April 2012, Drillisch AG issued non-subordinated debenture bonds vested with the right to convert to current registered shares of equity stock in freenet AG. The emission volume amounted to 125 million (corresponding to approximately 8.5 million shares of freenet AG stock). The debenture bonds are non-subordinate liabilities of Drillisch AG secured by a lien on the underlying shares of the freenet AG stock and of equal ranking with all other current and future non-subordinate liabilities of Drillisch AG. The underlying shares of freenet AG stock have been pledged for the benet of Deutsche Trustee Company Limited ("security trustees"). The bonds have a term of ve years. The debenture bonds may be called by Drillisch AG on or after 27 April 2015 if the share price of the freenet AG stock (over a certain period) exceeds 130% of the then applicable conversion price. The investors may declare the bonds due and payable at the nominal value plus any accrued interest as of the third anniversary of the issue. The bonds have been issued at 100% of the nominal value and will also be redeemed at 100%. They include an annual coupon of 3.375%. The conversion price was set at 14.7719 at the time of the issue. The debenture bonds (with a nominal value of 100,000.00 per bond) have been issued directly by Drillisch AG.
Following capital measures by freenet AG, the conversion price and number of pledged shares are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate (dilution protection). The conversion ratio applicable to the debenture bond was adjusted pursuant to Section 10 (5) of the Terms and Conditions of Issue of the Debenture Bond in May 2012 owing to the distribution of a cash dividend (as dened in the Terms and Conditions of the Issue of the Debenture Bond) for scal year 2011. As of the closing date, the conversion price amounts to 14.0978 and the number of shares securing the lien amounts to 8.9 million.
The structuring fee of 2,000k incurred with the nancing transaction in 2012 will be distributed per schedule according to the effective interest method over the term.
Owing to the contracted opportunities to call the bonds for Drillisch AG and investors dependent on the development of the price of the freenet AG stock, a term of three years has been assumed for disclosing and valuating the components of the debenture bonds in the balance sheet. The bonds have been partitioned into a base instrument (debenture bond) and an option right (long-term nancial liability) as of the issue date. The base instrument is valuated at the cost of acquisition carried forward in accordance with the effective interest method. The option right is measured at its fair value as operating results per each closing date.

29. Additional disclosures of nancial instruments in accordance with IFRS 7
A nancial reporting system responsible for the security and nancing activities of the Group has been installed throughout the Drillisch Group. Market, liquidity and loan risks of the Group can be identied and appropriate measures and strategies determined with the aid of this nancial reporting system. The risks are managed centrally in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Management Board.
The Drillisch Group is subject to various threats in its business elds. These threats and their management are described in detail in the risk report which is part of the consolidated management report. Capital management is described under Point 1.9 of the consolidated management report.
The risks resulting from the nancial instruments are related to loan risks, liquidity risks and market risks. The loan risks take the form of the risks of losses of nancial assets. Liquidity risks are renancing risks and are risks of the on-time fullment of the Group's existing payment obligations. Market risks occur in the Group in the form of interest risks and stock price risks.
The risk of asset losses in the Group is limited as a maximum to the book values of the nancial assets. For the original nancial instruments, this is the total of the book values. The risk of asset losses is given due consideration by valuation allowances or insurance policies. There is no concentration of risks of loss of assets on individual debtors, especially because of the mass business. When seen against this background, the risk of loss is deemed to be slight.
Early recognition of the future liquidity situation is obtained by considering payment ows, taking into account the planned assets and liabilities and earning position in the 5-year planning of the Group. The short-term liquidity planning is updated daily with actual gures.
IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses to show market risks. The inuence of risk variables on earnings and equity is to be described by hypothetical changes in these variables based on past experience. In this regard, risks due to changes in interest and stock prices are above all relevant for the Drillisch Group.
The holdings in the nancial instruments as of the balance sheet date are representative for the entire scal year. The holdings in the nancial instruments are measured as imputed values with additions and deductions to the risk variables to determine their effects on earnings and equity.
Interest risks results from changes in the market interest level. Within the framework of the sensitivity analysis of IFRS 7, the effects of changes in the market interest level on interest payments, interest expenses and interest income, on other sectors of the results and on equity are shown.
The sensitivity analyses of interest risks are based on the following premises: Original nancial instruments with xed interest rates are subject to interest risks only if they are measured at fair value. Financial instruments which are valuated at acquisition costs are not subject to any risks from changes in the market interest level.

94

Drillisch Annual Report 2012

CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
Consolidated Notes
Original nancial instruments with a variable interest rate are subject to market interest risks and are included in the sensitivity analysis. No such nancial instruments existed on the balance sheet closing date. Stock price risks result from changes in the market prices (stock exchange prices). Within the framework of the sensitivity analysis of IFRS 7, the effects of changes in the stock exchange prices on the results and on equity are shown.
Sensitivity analysis Had there been a change in the stock exchange price for the freenet AG shares of ±10% per 31 December 2012, the consolidated results/equity would have been 22.6m (after taxes) higher or 16.5m (after taxes) lower, provided that all other conditions had remained the same.
Miscellaneous disclosures about nancial instruments None of the nancial assets were reclassied into another valuation category of IAS 39 during the reporting period. None of the nancial assets and nancial liabilities were designated as effective for income at the attributable market value during the reporting period. The pertinent book value for short-term nancial assets and liabilities which are not derivatives is a reasonable approximation of the attributable market value within the sense of IFRS 7.29(a). The book values of nancial assets shown in the balance sheet in accordance with the equity method which serve as collateral for liabilities and the terms and conditions of collateral are shown under the item "Liabilities due to banks".

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value can be classied according to the valuation hierarchy of IFRS 7 (so-called fair value hierarchy) as shown here.
The hedging transactions disclosed under nancial liabilities are classied in the level "derived from prices (Level 2)" and shown in the balance sheet at a fair value of 54.2m.
The basis of the hierarchy levels is the factors used to determine the fair value. Level 1 utilises the quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 utilises inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 utilises inputs which are not based on observable market data and must be determined on the basis of valuation methods. No measurements have been made at Levels 1 and 3.

Consolidated Notes

With the exception of the equity holding of 259.8m and nancial liabilities of 332.3m, the Group's assets and liabilities must be attributed almost exclusively to the telecommunications sector.
All relations within and/or between the segments are eliminated in the course of consolidation. Such relations are essentially the offsetting of the expenses and income within the Group. The accounting principles (IFRS as they are to be applied in the EU) are identical for all of the segments.
The transfer prices correspond on principle to the prices determined by arm's length comparison. Since Drillisch Group is active only in Germany, there are no geographic segments. The most important segment expenses and income not affecting payments include the allocations to the provisions and the measurement of the hedging transactions and the equity result.

Auditor´s Opinion

Auditor's Report
We have audited the consolidated nancial statements prepared by the Drillisch Aktiengesellschaft, Maintal, comprising the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of nancial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash ows and the notes to the consolidated nancial statements, together with the group management report for the nancial year from 1. January 2012 to 31. December 2012. The preparation of the consolidated nancial statements and the group management report in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a (1) of the HGB are the responsibility of the legal representatives of the parent company. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated nancial statements and on the group management report based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated nancial statements in accordance with § 317 of the HGB and the German generally accepted standards for the audit of nancial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, nancial position and results of operations in the consolidated nancial statements in accordance with the applicable nancial reporting framework and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated nancial statements and the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the nancial information of those components consolidated, the scope of the consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and signicant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated nancial statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit has not led to any reservations.
In our opinion, based on the ndings of our audit, the consolidated nancial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a (1) of the HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, nancial position and results of operations of the group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated nancial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

As with the other wireless communication generations, operation requires a network comprised of base stations

that service a specic area and appropriately compatible end appliances. In the frequency ranges that are earmarked in Germany for LTE, the network structure that still has to be established is very similar to the cell structure currently used by the existing wireless communication networks. As such, numerous existing wireless communication sites will also be used for LTE technology. (Source: http:// emf2.bundesnetzagentur.de/tech_lte.html )
