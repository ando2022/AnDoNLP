Leading the way in the UK potato industry
The Group has operations throughout the UK in seed production, growing and packing and serves a number of market sectors including retail, foodservice, wholesale and trading. The Group is split into three segments:

1. Fresh
Which comprises Greenvale AP, Jersey Royal Company Limited and Rowe Farming, and accounts for 77.4% of Group revenues. Customers include a number of the UK leading grocery retailers and wholesale and foodservice companies.

2. Processing
Which accounts for 3.3% of Group revenues. Ingredients supplied are used by a large number of food manufacturers in products such as diced potato salads and mashed potato for fish cakes and ready meals.

3. Other
Includes the seed business, Restrain Company Limited and direct trading, and accounts for 19.3% of Group revenues. The seed business exports circa 25% of total production. The proportion of revenues for Restrain from overseas were similar to last year, being circa 70% of total.

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY The Produce Investments Group has a number of businesses located across the UK and the recent acquisitions of Rowe Farming in 2012 and The Jersey Royal Company Limited in 2014 complement and add strength and diversity to the Group. In addition circa 25% of our seed revenues come from overseas, and sales of Restrain, our ethylene storage and ripening business, are growing outside the UK.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
A more diverse customer base
GREENVALE AP
Greenvale traded successfully through a less stable year
characterised by lower yielding crops and higher raw material prices.
However new business wins during the year and continued investment in the new ERP system see the business
well positioned for future growth.
Greenvale AP (GVAP) is a unique vertically integrated business. This starts with our seed variety and
development programme and also includes our seed potato business and our own growing potato operations in Perthshire, the Scottish Borders and the Eastern Counties, making us the biggest grower
of fresh table potatoes in the UK. GVAP procures from 200 growers in the UK, most of whom we supply seed to, and along with the potatoes from our own growing operations provide our pack sites with the material to store, manage and pack for our
key customer base 364 days of the year.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

A strong finish from a difficult start

The Group ended on a high in a year of two halves. I am pleased to report a strong performance in the second half of our financial year, confirming the effectiveness of our strategic approach and the success of the diversified business model we have developed in our established produce operations.

R E S U LT S As we anticipated in the interim report, the second half saw a much improved trading result as we began to recover higher raw material costs in our core Greenvale potato business, enjoyed a strong season for Jersey Royals and started to realise the benefits of our new ERP system. This has delivered a Group operating profit before exceptional items for the year of £8.4m (2016: £9.2m), in line with our expectations, and a profit before tax of £6.6m (2016: £3.5m) despite the increased loss before tax of £1.0m (2016: loss £0.2m) reported in the first half.
DIVIDEND The Board recommends an increased final dividend of 5.026 pence per share (2016: 4.88 pence). Together with the interim dividend of 2.44 pence per share (2016: 2.44 pence) paid in April, this makes a total dividend for the year of 7.466 pence (2016: 7.32 pence), a rise of 2.0%. Subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), the final dividend will be paid on 5 December 2017 to ordinary shareholders on the register at the close of business on 3 November 2017.

BOARD CHANGES I will be retiring at the AGM on 29 November 2017, as will Non-Executive Director (NED) Sean Christie. Having served two full three-year terms, Senior independent NED Sir David Naish will also be retiring by rotation. Barrie Clapham will resume the position of Chairman on an interim basis as the Group commences a recruitment process to find a more permanent successor. Liz Kynoch will continue in her role as NED, as will Robert Johnston, the principal representative of the Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust, the largest shareholder in the Group, who joined the Board as NED on 9 June 2017. The Board will continue to work in a sustainable way to deliver incremental shareholder value over the longer term.
S T R AT E G Y Following the restatement of the Company Strategy at the interims in March, the Board has decided to revert to the original strategy of growing the business through strategic acquisitions of quality businesses that offer synergies and product or customer diversification. At the same time we will continue to explore and fund the organic growth opportunities of the subsidiary companies.

PEOPLE On behalf of the Board, I would like to express sincere thanks to all our employees for their hard work in delivering these results, and for their continuing commitment to ensuring we provide our customers with products and service of the highest quality. Maintaining and improving these high standards is key to our future success.
OUTLOOK Looking to the year ahead, harvest is now progressing, although with the majority of the potato crop still in the ground, favourable weather is required during October to see the harvest safely secured. Assuming harvest proceeds as it should, an increase in the planted area will see a gross crop yield that will exceed demand and therefore deflate raw material prices. A solid start to the year sees trading in line with forecast and the new business gains, and new contractual arrangements with established customers give us much enhanced visibility on both volume and margins in our core retail potato business. We are achieving improved efficiencies in our two fresh potato processing sites, and anticipate further significant efficiency benefits from the implementation of our

04 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

new ERP system. All this allows us to feel confident in the Group's ability to achieve good progress during the current year.
As a business predominantly growing and selling produce in the UK, our principal concern about Britain's withdrawal from the EU is ensuring the continued availability of high quality seasonal labour. While we have encountered no difficulties in recruitment to date, and return rates of seasonal staff remain high, clear direction from the Government is required to ensure a Brexit agreement that maintains access to this essential resource.
The Group continues to generate cash and we are well placed to continue our well-established and proven strategy of widening both our product range and customer base within our existing produce operations, and to exploit other opportunities for profitable acquisitions as these arise.
Neil Davidson Chairman 27 September 2017

REASONS TO INVEST IN PRODUCE INVESTMENTS
Produce Investments is a diverse business with a solid core at its foundation and continues to seek acquisition opportunities offering good returns and exciting growth prospects. The core business supplies fresh products 364 days of the year, into a defensive category with high levels of customer penetration.

1. Improved margins
The Group continues to seek opportunities to add businesses that deliver higher margins and enhance profitability and shareholder returns.

2. Acquisition opportunities
The recent acquisitions demonstrate the Groups appetite and ability to complete and deliver on acquisitions. Management will continue to seek out and explore opportunities to further expand the Group through the addition of appropriate complimentary businesses.

3. New customers

4. Products diversification

The Group's strategy is to continue to grow its sales with other key customers. The acquisition of both Rowe Farming and The Jersey Royal Company gives access to potential new customers.

Our strategy is to seek opportunities that provide growth outside the fresh potato sector. This could come from processed products or other fresh vegetables where our key strengths in commercial and supply chain management can add value and deliver synergies.

OUR STRATEGY
Providing a strong platform for development

OUR STRATEGIC APPROACH
Our strategy is to significantly grow the scale and profitability of the Group by acquiring quality businesses that offer synergies coupled with product/customer diversification, whilst at the same time funding organic growth strategies.
The recent acquisitions demonstrate our strategy in action. The Board firmly believes in this strategy and, if well executed, will deliver sustainable value growth to all stakeholders and shareholders of the business.

01
Growth through acquisition
The acquisition of Rowe Farming in 2012 and The Jersey Royal Company in 2014 demonstrates the ability of the management team to successfully deliver and integrate new businesses within the expanding Group. Management continue to seek quality businesses that offer synergies along with product and customer diversification.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

Strength in diversity

Diversification, investment, new business gains and strengthened customer relationships have all helped us to overcome the significant challenges posed by rising raw material costs and continuing intense price competition in the UK retail market place.

FRESH Our core potato business, accounting for circa 78% of Group revenues during the year (2016: circa 78%), traded successfully through a less stable year, characterised by lower crop yields, resulting in higher raw material costs and retail price deflation. Although the planted area for UK potatoes increased by just over 4% in the 2016 harvest, below average yields resulted in a 4% reduction in the total crop to 5.22m tonnes (2015 harvest: 5.43m tonnes). With demand outstripping supply throughout the year, input costs remained consistently high. However, Kantar World panel data for the fresh retail potato market showed a decline in market value of 3.5% during the year, on relatively static volumes, reflecting the continuation of intense competition in the supermarket sector.
We have benefited from our strategic approach in this challenging market, securing increased volumes with a major retail customer for a fixed period of three

years through the adoption of a more collaborative and transparent approach to supply chain management. This has delivered improved efficiencies for both parties. We are also pleased to announce that we have won a third mainstream retail account, again for an initial fixed period of three years. Sales into the non-retail sectors of foodservice and wholesale also showed good growth during the year, and the launch of Linwood Crops at the start of the year as a subsidiary trading division will support further growth in these sectors.
Following completion of our packing site rationalisation programme in 2015, we now operate two efficient facilities in Scotland and Cambridgeshire, both of which are very well placed for both the major UK potato growing areas and distribution channels. We have continued to drive productivity through investment in these sites, which accounted for a significant proportion of the Group's operational capital expenditure during the year of

£4.8m (net of Peacock farm packing facility acquisition) (2016: £3.7m).
We have also continued our investment in IT, following the successful transition in 2015 from in-house servers to a cloud-based external provider, thereby reducing the risk of business disruption and improving our contingency planning and disaster recovery capability. The focus this year has been on the installation of our new ERP system which, as noted in the interim report, resulted in some additional costs during a longer than expected implementation process. The roll-out across both our UK packing sites has now been completed and we are pleased to report that it has bedded in well, and that the expected planning and process efficiencies are starting to be realised.
Our growing arm had a successful year, benefiting from higher raw material prices. The increased order book in our fresh packing business also drove higher

FROM SEED TO TABLE
An illustrative timeline

1. The growing cycle starts with top quality seed
production nearly 12 months in advance.

2. Planting of the ware crop takes place from February
to April.

3. It takes about seven months to grow a field of main crop potatoes. The crop is sprayed to control weeds and guard against pests. The crop requires a lot of water to
help it grow.

4. From June to September the crop
is harvested into wooden boxes and taken to the farm.

5. The crop is quality controlled by eye to remove any
unwanted potatoes before packing.

6. Nearly 250,000 tonnes of potatoes
are distributed every year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

demand for seed, delivering a strong performance by our seed division. Our varietal development programme in this division continues apace, and we have a strong pipeline of new potato varieties coming through to market.
Our Cornish business of Rowe has had an average year growing, picking and marketing daffodils in a season that extends from late December to late April. Unfortunately rapid crop development resulted in an early harvest which compromised sales opportunities. Expansion of our production area has given us the opportunity to serve an extended customer base, enabling us to secure a number of new business wins during the year. In addition to daffodils, Rowe Farming also grows and supplies early potatoes from Cornwall, and made a successful start to the 2017 season.
Following a good and uninterrupted planting season, and subsequent favourable growing conditions, Jersey produced an excellent crop of new potatoes in 2017. Strong UK demand from the launch of the crop in late April into June ensured an equally successful sales season, and the performance of the business was further enhanced by our continued focus on cost control and efficiency gains.
PROCESSING Our potato processing business has continued its recovery, benefiting from a new management structure and an ongoing focus on improved processes and efficiencies. We have invested in new cooking equipment and detection technology, extended our product range into the raw peel sector and gained new business as a result. The performance of the business was much improved in the closing months of the year and we are about to install a third production line in the factory to keep pace with growing demand.

OTHER Our storage and ripening technology business enjoyed a better year, with recovery in two core markets. In addition, new member state chemical approvals within the EU have enabled Restrain to achieve a significant increase in its territorial reach within the last few months, giving solid grounds for optimism about its prospects in the year ahead.

The diversity of our core business has delivered real benefits during the year under review. This proven model, the new retail business we have secured and the more transparent arrangements we have agreed with established customers, all give us increased confidence in our ability to achieve profitable growth in our established produce operations in the years ahead.

FINANCES The business remains cash-generative. An increase in net debt to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) at the year end principally reflects our purchase during the year of a packing facility (land and buildings) in Jersey for £6.1m (cash), as well as higher stock valuations and increased trade receivables. Following the closure of Greenvale's Kent packing facility in December 2015 we have removed all plant and machinery from the buildings and are confident that the sale of the site is now nearing completion.

Angus Armstrong Chief Executive Officer 27 September 2017

PROSPECTS The indications are that the planted area of potatoes in the UK has increased by approximately 4% for the second successive year. A timely planting season has been followed by variable growing conditions, and current predictions are for a 2017 crop that is of average yield and quality. If this proves to be accurate, it could deliver a gross yield as much as 9% greater than in 2016 at around 5.7m tonnes. This would usually indicate that we will have a season with more moderate raw material pricing compared with the 2016/2017 season.

Turnover and profits have increased due to a recovery in core markets supported by additional regulatory approvals by EU member states.
The principal activity of the Company is the sale, lease and marketing of the Restrain system for
the production and maintenance of a stable atmosphere of ethylene within potato and onion
stores for sprout suppression and seed potato management. The system continues to provide the only residue free solution for sprout suppression in stored potatoes and onions in the UK, Europe and other territories across the world.

Rapid crop development resulted in an early harvest which comprised sales opportunities. Sales volume and value did increase during the year, as did costs.
Rowe also harvest and sell a quantity of daffodil bulbs at the end of each season once they have been harvested, sorted, cleaned and sterilised. In recent years we have increased both the number of varieties grown, the acreage planted and have expanded production to Perthshire. This has been necessary to cope with increased demand at the

STRATEGIC REPORT

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

A year of two halves

The Directors present their report and financial statements of Produce Investments plc for the 53 weeks ended 1 July 2017. The current period was 53 weeks compared to the prior period of 52 weeks. References in this document to current and prior year refer to 53 weeks (2017) and 52 weeks (2016), respectively.

PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES The principal activity of the Company in the year under review was that of a holding company for the Produce Investment Group of companies, which grows, sources, packs and markets fresh potatoes, daffodils bulbs and flowers.
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS The Directors are content with the solid performance of the Group in the year to 1 July 2017. Despite the difficult trading, high raw material costs and low yielding crop through the first half of the year, the Group, as forecast, recovered well and delivered one of its strongest six-month periods ever. Operating profit before exceptional items of £8.4m compared to £9.2m in the previous year, a decrease of 9.1%. However, the second half of the year was significantly ahead of the same period last year, delivering £8.1m vs £5.8m, an increase of 40.7%. As reported during the half year results, trading in the second half recovered the majority of the high raw material costs through the pricing arrangements with our key customers. Profit before tax was £6.5m, an 88% increase vs the prior year (£3.9m). Profit before tax in the current year includes an exceptional charge of £1.0m announced at the half year. The exceptional items are the write off of suspense accounts identified by the business within legacy ERP systems (£0.5m), the shutting down of an animal feed plant at the Group's Swancote site (£0.3m) and impairments arising from assets in the fresh business (£0.2m).

Revenue came in at £200.1m up 8.1% vs the prior year (2016: £185.1m), primarily on the back of increased selling prices driven by the high cost of raw material. Cost of Goods sold at £128.7m was up 11.8% on the back of the raw material cost and retailer pack size mix.
Working capital, viewed as Inventories, Biological assets, Trade receivables, and Trade payables has increased from £35.6m (2016) to £40.9m, (15%). Working capital has risen mainly as a result of the high priced raw material, however, extended customer terms have also contributed to this increase.
Property, plant and equipment is up £5.8m to £39.9m, primarily as a result of the Peacock Farm purchase on Jersey. Intangible assets are £15.6m at the year end; consistent with the prior year, the Directors have performed an impairment test on both Rowe Farming and Swancote Foods (detailed in Note 13). The Directors are content with the carrying values based on the testing performed. However, this will require both businesses to show some improvement in financial performance compared with the current year.
Net debt increased to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) as a result of the option exercised on Peacock Farm (£6.1m) and movements in working capital. The Group continues to generate cash. However operating cash flows in the current period were £3.4m (2016: £9.6m) as a result of increased customer terms, and the higher cost of inventory holding.

Overall, most parts of the Group have performed well in the year. The core business traded successfully in a difficult season; it secured increased volumes and has delivered further efficiencies. Swancote has continued to recover, supported by a new management team and improved processes. Rowe had an average year, extending further our customer base, and the expanded production area has helped support this. Jersey had an outstanding year, higher than average spring and early summer temperatures drove healthy UK demand, and the margin was further supported by continued cost control and efficiencies.

MITIGATION

IMPACT OF ADVERSE WEATHER ­­
­­ The Group's operations are influenced by the volume and quality of the UK potato crop. In the event of a poor UK ­­ potato crop owing to adverse weather conditions, the Group is likely to suffer from an increased price for a proportion ­­ of its potato supplies.
­­ The Group's exposure to adverse weather conditions is increased due to its own growing operations, including Rowe Farming and Jersey Royal's grown in Jersey.

The geographically diverse spread of third party procurement and the Group's own growing operations, covering the main potato growing regions of the UK, reduces the risk to the Group of crop failure in any specific region. Recent changes to the supply models with our core retail customers' means we are more aligned to prevailing market conditions in any given season, thereby reduces the impact of crop variations on the Group's financial performance. An element of Jersey crop is supplied from third party growers which reduces the risk and exposure to the Group.

STAFF RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION
­­ Our people are our biggest asset are key to the future success of the Group. The loss or failure to attract, develop and retain key individuals and staff would have a detrimental effect on the Group's ability to operate and achieve its strategic objectives.

­­ The Group has a rolling development programme in place to allow employees to improve learning and skills.
­­ Individual performance reviews and assessments are routinely undertaken with all managers across the Group which focuses on individual development plans. Succession plans are in place and regularly reviewed for key management.
­­ The Group also has a number of incentive schemes in place linked to performance criteria for both business unit and the Group which are designed to be competitive and help retention of key individuals.
­­ Regular reviews are undertaken to benchmark `total benefits' against external market environment to ensure these remain competitive.

DEBT FUNDING AVAILABILITY AND LIQUIDITY
­­ The Group's strategic objective is to grow the Group, which might require increased debt funding.
­­ This could be affected by prolonged periods of market volatility or liquidity.

­­ Regular and ongoing dialogue with existing and potential funders to ensure that appropriate levels of funding are available based on the current market conditions.
­­ The Group seeks to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations and applying cash collection targets. The Group also manages liquidity risk via revolving credit facilities and long-term debt.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is operating profit from continuing operations before any exceptional items expressed as a percentage of total revenue. High seasonal prices have impacted the overall EBITDA margin.

Non-financial KPI's are principally efficiency related and include: ­­ Volume of potatoes sold: overall total
volumes have dropped slightly (2%). The change of retailer mix has contributed towards this; however, we are expecting to see a good uplift going into the 2017/18 season as we are on board for a full year with the new customer base. ­­ Yield %: the Group monitors the yield through its main fresh potato sites. During the year we have experienced a more balanced crop position and I am pleased to report that yields have increased further, up 0.9%, primarily on the Group's ability in managing crop usage. ­­ Man hours per tonne: the Group monitors the number of worked hours to pack fresh potatoes and this showed an adverse movement for the year, 6.19 hours per tonne for 2017 vs 5.30 hours per tonne, due to the last three months uplift in labour behind the full year increased volumes of two key customers. We expect this to stabilise and decrease throughout the coming period.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
This report has been approved by the Board and the Nominations and Remuneration Committee and has been voluntarily prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and with due account taken of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The report also provides the information required to be reported on Directors' remuneration under AIM Rule 19.
NOMINATIONS AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Composition of the Committee The members of the Committee, all of whom are considered independent of the executive management team, are: ­­ Sir David Naish (Chairman) ­­ Liz Kynoch ­­ Neil Davidson
Role of the Committee The key responsibilities of the Committee are to make recommendations to the Board as to the: ­­ Board policy and elements for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman; ­­ individual elements of the remuneration of those Directors; and ­­ grant of share-based incentives to Executive Directors and all other employees.
No Director takes part in any discussion directly concerning his own remuneration.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company's website at: www.produceinvestments.co.uk.
Advisers to the Committee The Committee has appointed independent remuneration consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Corporation) to advise on all aspects of senior Executive remuneration.
The Committee also seeks advice where appropriate from the Group Human Resources Director and Company Secretary to ensure that the remuneration policy proposed by the Committee to the Board takes account of Company-specific factors relating to strategy and takes due account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Remuneration policy is based on the following broad principles set by the Committee: ­­ to provide a market competitive remuneration package to attract and retain Executives of sufficient calibre; ­­ to align remuneration to the business strategy; ­­ to align the interests of Executive Directors with the interests of shareholders; and ­­ to take account of: (i) pay and conditions throughout the Group; and (ii) established best practice as set out in institutional
investor guidelines.
The objective of this policy is aligned with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee ensures that account is taken of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks when setting remuneration and is comfortable that remuneration packages do not raise any ESG risks by motivating irresponsible behaviour. The Committee also ensures that inappropriate operational and financial risk-taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded through the remuneration policies and that, instead, a sensible balance is struck between fixed and performance-related pay, short and long-term incentives and cash and sharebased remuneration.
Fixed vs performance-related remuneration In order to incentivise management whilst aligning their interests with those of shareholders, a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors' pay is performance-related, through an annual bonus plan (based on profit growth) and share-based long-term incentives (based on EPS).
REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The fees of the Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chairman) are set by the Board. When setting these fees, due account is taken of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies, the time commitment of each Director and any additional responsibilities undertaken, such as acting as Chairman to one of the Board Committees or as Senior Independent Director.
Currently the fee level for the Chairman is £90,000. The fee level for the Senior Independent Director, Sir David Naish is £45,000, comprising a base fee of £40,000 and an additional fee for Chairing the Remuneration Committee of £5,000. The fees for Liz Kynoch and Sean Christie are £40,000 and £45,000, respectively, with Sean Christie receiving an additional £5,000 annum for chairing the Audit Committee. Fees are still to be agreed with Rob Johnston and Barrie Clapham who joined the Board on 9 June 2017.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in long-term incentive schemes.

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors' Report, the Strategic Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the AIM Rules of The London Stock Exchange to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards `IFRS' as adopted by the European Union `EU' and have elected under company law to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing each of the Group and company financial statements, the Directors are required to: a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; c. for the Group financial statements state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and for the
Company financial statements state whether applicable United Kingdom accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Company financial statements; and d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business. The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and the Company transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Produce Investments plc website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from the legislation in other jurisdictions.

OPINION We have audited the financial statements of Produce Investments plc (the `parent company') and its subsidiaries (the `Group') for the 53 weeks ended 1 July 2017 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement, the Company balance sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 `The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)'.
In our opinion: ­­ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 1 July 2017 and
of the Group's profit for the period then ended; ­­ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; ­­ the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice; and ­­ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: ­­ the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or ­­ the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt
about the Group's or the parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 12 months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Valuation of Biological assets (Note 5) The Group has significant biological assets of £21.0m. The Group applies IAS 41 `Agriculture' to account for these assets which requires the assets to be measured at their fair value less cost to sell. The valuation of these biological assets is inherently judgemental because: ­­ the biological assets are growing within the ground at the balance sheet date and therefore management have to estimate the
quantity of biological assets; and ­­ the estimation of fair value less cost to sell involves judgement in determining both likely selling prices and also costs to sell.
Due to the degree of estimation and judgement involved in the valuation of biological assets, there is a significant audit risk that there may be a material error in the calculations provided by management.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PRODUCE INVESTMENTS PLC (CONTINUED)
Management provided us with an analysis of the biological assets held by the Group by business, together with their calculation of fair value less cost to sell. We performed audit work for each business and for each type of biological asset (being potatoes and daffodil bulbs) as follows: ­­ Discussed the basis of the valuation with management, and compared it with the valuation performed in the prior year to identify
any major changes in approach or input assumptions. ­­ Considered the nature of the produce to ensure that we were satisfied that the asset should be recognised as a biological asset. ­­ Compared the valuation methodology used with the requirements of IAS 41 and IFRS 13 `Fair Value Measurement' to ensure that
the valuation presented was technically compliant with these standards. ­­ Compared the assumptions used to estimate the quantity of biological assets to a range of non-financial information, depending
upon the specific nature of each business. This included planting records, harvest records (where biological assets have been harvested after the balance sheet date), land registers showing specific areas currently farmed by the Group and historic yields achieved in previous periods where relevant. ­­ Compared selling price assumptions to actual sales or purchase transactions that had taken place around or after the balance sheet date or, in the case of seed potatoes, by reference to similar seed potato sales in previous seasons. ­­ Compared cost to sell assumptions to the actual costs incurred in the current year within the relevant business.
Given the degree of estimation, we aggregated both factual and judgemental differences that our work identified and considered these within the context of our overall audit.
Impairment of intangible assets (Note 13) The Group has intangible assets of £15.6m at the balance sheet date and management have performed an impairment test on this balance. Impairment testing requires management to identify appropriate cash-generating units (CGUs), identify the carrying amount of the CGU and to determine the value in use of the CGU through performing net present value calculations.
Impairment testing involves a significant degree of judgement due to the level of estimation involved in estimating the likely future performance of the business. A material amount of goodwill relates to the processing CGU (also referred to as Swancote Foods) and to Rowe Farming. Given the performance of these businesses during the year, we identified that there was a significant audit risk that these CGUs might be impaired and that a material adjustment to carrying amount might be necessary.
Management provided us with an impairment test for each CGU detailed in Note 13. We performed audit work on these tests as follows: ­­ Agreed the carrying amount of the CGU to underlying records at 1 July 2017. ­­ Checked the arithmetical accuracy and methodology behind the calculation of the value in use of the CGU. ­­ Compared the calculation of the discount rate used in the value in use calculation to a range of discount rates that we consider
appropriate for the Group. ­­ Checked the calculation of free cash flow to ensure that appropriate adjustments were made for capital expenditure and
working capital. ­­ Considered the forecasts used in the calculation of value in use, and compared them with historic results and future forecasts. We
discussed these forecasts with management and challenged key assumptions, requesting supporting evidence where available.
Based on this work, we formed our own view as to the likelihood of future forecasts being achieved and discussed with management the key issues and sensitivities relating to the forecasts. We then focused on ensuring that the disclosures made in Note 13, particularly with regard to sensitivity, adequately described those key assumptions that might possibly change and result in impairment.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALIT Y When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effects of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. During planning we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judge would be material for the financial statements as a whole (FSM). During planning FSM was calculated as £1,800,000, which was not changed during the course of our audit. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £10,000, as well as differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT Our audit scope included all components and was performed to component materiality. Our audit work therefore covered 100% of Group revenue, Group profit and total Group assets and liabilities. It was performed to the materiality levels set out above.

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements
OTHER INFORMATION The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: ­­ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and ­­ the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors' Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: ­­ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or ­­ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or ­­ certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or ­­ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS As explained more fully in the Directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 16, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 1 JULY 2017

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

1 GENERAL INFORMATION Produce Investments plc (`the Company') and its subsidiaries (together `the Group') is a leading operator in the fresh potato and daffodil sectors. The Group has vertically integrated activities covering seed and bulb development, seed and bulb production, farming, processing/packing and supply of produce to the major retailers. The Company's subsidiaries are listed in Note 27.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. Its registered office is Floods Ferry Road, Doddington, March, Cambridgeshire, PE15 OUW.
The financial year represents 53 weeks to 1 July 2017 (prior year 52 weeks to 25 June 2016).
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION The Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the period ended 1 July 2017 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the period.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and biological assets, which have both been measured at fair value in line with applicable accounting standards. The consolidated financial statements are presented in British pounds sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£´000) except when otherwise indicated.
Going concern The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Further information regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements on pages 32 to 65. In addition, the notes to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. Cash balances and borrowings are included in Notes 14 and 17.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 1 July 2017. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All material intra-Group balances, income and expenses, unrealised gains and losses and dividends resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a change of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. Losses are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it: ­­ Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary. ­­ Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest. ­­ Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity. ­­ Recognises the fair value of the consideration received. ­­ Recognises the fair value of any investment retained. ­­ Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss. ­­ Reclassifies the parent's share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss.
Changes in accounting estimates and disclosures The Group has adopted all IFRS and IFRIC interpretations effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2017.
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group's financial statements are listed below: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (amendments) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases IAS 7 Statement of cash flows
The Group is currently investigating the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. The Group expects that there will be no material impact on the consolidated financial statements resulting from the implementation of any of the other above standards.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) Key sources of estimation uncertainty and key judgements The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the valuation of biological assets, the measurement and impairment of intangible assets and the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations.
The measurement of biological assets requires assumptions regarding expected yields of crops, percentage of crop that are saleable, and the expected market value at the date of harvest. Biological assets at the reporting date were valued at £21.0m (2016: £19.8m) (see Note 5 for further disclosure).
The Group reviews whether intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis, and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate. Intangible assets at the reporting date had a net book value of £15.6m (2016: £16.1m) (see Note 13 for further disclosure).
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate. Defined benefit pension obligations at the reporting date were valued at £9.0m (2016: £7.3m) (see Note 21 for further disclosure).
Summary of significant accounting policies Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs incurred are expensed. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees' identifiable net assets.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date through the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Investments in associates The Group's non-controlling investments in other entities are accounted for on one of two bases, depending on the conditions relevant to each investment.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence. Where such conditions exist, the entity is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
The share of profit of associates is shown on the face of the income statement. This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associate and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associates.

Where the Group does not exert significant influence on an entity in which the Group holds a non-controlling investment, this investment is accounted for at fair value, less provisions for any impairment as discussed below.
After application of either the equity or cost method in line with the circumstances described above, the Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the impaired amount in the income statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes (e.g. Value Added Tax) or duty. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue arrangements. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer. Usually the risks and rewards of ownership transfer on despatch of the goods, however, for some customers, the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the buyer when the goods arrive with the buyer. Revenue from the sale of potatoes, daffodil flowers and bulbs to retailers and processors, is recognised on despatch. Revenue from the sale of seed potatoes is recognised on confirmed delivery. Given that goods are principally fresh food products that arrive with the buyer within hours of despatch, the date of despatch and the date of arrival are typically the same.
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease terms. Rentals paid in advance are recognised as deferred revenue.
Biological assets and agricultural produce The Group's operations include activities which are agricultural in nature and are subject to the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of IAS 41 Agriculture. The Group has identified its potato and daffodil bulb crops in the ground as biological assets. These assets are measured on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at fair value less cost to sell. Gains or losses arising on initial recognition of both biological assets and agricultural produce and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Taxes Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, by the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: ­­ Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not
a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. ­­ In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures,
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. ­­ Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, including the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: ­­ Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and ­­ In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Taxes (continued) Deferred tax (continued) The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. From 31 October 2007 the defined benefit plan ceased to accrue benefits going forward and accordingly there are no current service costs. The Group will continue to fund the scheme to ensure that it can meet its obligations. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the Projected Unit Credit method, calculated by an independent actuary every three years, and updated on an annual basis. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity and included as part of other comprehensive income.
The past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits have already vested, immediately following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, past service costs are recognised.
The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less past service costs and actuarial gains and losses not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled. Plan assets are not available to the creditors of the Group, nor can they be paid directly to the Group. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. Asset fair values are based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities it is the published bid price. The value of any defined benefit asset recognised is restricted to the sum of any past service costs and actuarial gains and losses not yet recognised and the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.
In addition to the defined benefit plan, the Group operates a stakeholder scheme and a personal pension plan. These are both defined contribution schemes. Contributions payable into these schemes during the period are charged to the income statement as they fall due. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the statement of financial position.
Share-based payment transactions Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. Fair value is determined using either a Monte Carlo pricing model or Black Scholes option pricing model, depending on the nature of the share option.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance criteria are satisfied.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management's best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in profit or loss for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in profit or loss.

Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the marketplace are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

The Group's financial assets include cash and short-term deposits and trade and other receivables.

Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, accruals, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.

Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Initial recognition and subsequent measurement From time to time the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk. These derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. These instruments have been designated as `financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss'. Accordingly, assets and liabilities arising from these derivative financial instruments are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. The Group has not designated any derivatives for hedge accounting.

Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:

­­ Buildings

4 to 50 years

­­ Plant and equipment

5 to 15 years

­­ Fixtures and fittings

2 to 10 years

­­ Land is not depreciated.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. The assets' residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

The asset held for resale is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The carrying value currently reflects the expected net realisable value and is reviewed as required.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Group as a lessee Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement. Leased assets are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. All intangible assets of the Group, other than goodwill, are assessed as having finite lives.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised within administrative and other operating expenses in the income statement.
Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate: ­­ The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. ­­ Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset. ­­ How the asset will generate future economic benefits. ­­ The availability of resources to complete the asset. ­­ The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. Such assets are amortised straight line over five years, being the period of expected future benefit. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Customer relationships The customer lists for Swancote Foods are amortised on a straight line basis over a useful economic life of 15 years.
Patents and licences Patents are the accumulated costs of applying for patents in the UK. An amortisation period of three years (straight line) is used as a conservative estimate of the length of effectiveness of the patent.
42 PRODUCE INVESTMENTS ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements
Impairment of non-financial assets including goodwill The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed in future periods.
Foreign currency translation The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in British pounds, which is also the parent company's functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for as follows: ­­ Raw materials ­ purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis. ­­ Finished goods and work in progress ­ cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on
normal operating capacity but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Agricultural produce is recognised at fair value less costs to sell at the date of harvest. Once harvested, these goods are subsequently accounted for under IAS2 in the same manner as other inventories purchased from third parties.
Cash and short-term deposits Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated statement cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in that year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better assess trends in financial performance.

Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited ­ Associate The Group has a 33.3% interest in Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited, a company incorporated in Scotland which is involved in the growing of potatoes.

Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited is a private entity that is not listed on any public exchange. Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited reports its financial performance with a year end of 31 May. The following table illustrates summarised unaudited financial information of the Group's investment in Organic Potato Growers (Scotland) Limited:

A dividend of £nil was received in the year (2016: £nil).
BROP ­ Investment The Group has a 30% interest in BROP, a company incorporated in the Czech Republic which is involved in the growing and selling of potatoes. BROP is a private entity that is not listed on any public exchange. The Group does not exert significant influence over this entity and therefore does not regard it as an associate. The Group has reached this conclusion because there is no Group involvement in BROP's day-to-day trading and management, no participation in everyday decisions, no exchanges of personnel between the entities and no essential technical information exchanged between the entities.
The Group accounts for its interest in BROP at fair value of £65,000 (2016: £21,000).
Kernow Grain Ltd ­ Investment The Group has an investment, valued at fair value of £57,000 (2016: £57,000) in Kernow Grain Ltd as part of the acquisition of Rowe Farming Ltd. Kernow Grain Ltd is a cooperative of farmers who are required to invest a figure based on their level of activity in the company.
ABG Biofumigants Limited ­ Investment During 2016 the Group established a three-way joint venture in ABG Biofumigants Limited and therefore holds 33.3%. The business is currently dormant.
The Little Spud Company Limited ­ Investment During 2017 this entity was incorporated. The Group controls 25% of this newly established enterprise. The business was incorporated on 4 April 2017 and will trade potatoes.
4 OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION Management have determined the operating segments based on the reports utilised by the Directors for making strategic decisions. These are split as follows: ­­ Fresh ­­ Processing ­­ Other
Fresh includes the sites, staff, and assets that grow, source, pack and deliver fresh produce to customers, ranging from large retailers and wholesalers to small private businesses. This covers potatoes, daffodils and bulbs.
Processing includes the staff and assets that supply pre-prepared potato products which are ultimately sold as ingredients for food manufacturers.

Other includes all remaining activities of the Group. This comprises of the Greenvale AP Limited potato seed business, Greenvale AP Limited potato trading, where Greenvale acts as an intermediary between the farmer and the end customer, Restrain Company Limited (an ethylene storage and ripening business) and Linwood Crops Limited (a potato trading business).

Management monitors the operating results of each business location separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. However, Group financing costs and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not segmented for management information purposes. Assets and liabilities are discussed further below.

Inventory, receivables and payables are managed centrally and balances cannot be easily apportioned between separate segments. Consequently, no segmental analysis of these items is presented.

The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The revenues and operating profit per reportable segment agree in aggregate to the consolidated totals per the financial statements.
Segmentation of assets and liabilities Investments in associates and other investments (Note 3) are not segmented. Such items are managed at Board level and are not integral or specifically linked to the operations of any of the Group segments.
Other non-current financial liabilities all relate to the Fresh segment.
No segmentation is presented in respect of receivables, payables, financing, loans and cash. The Group Financial Control team manages these items independently from the operating segments. The centralised structure of the finance records does not permit an accurate allocation of receivables and payables between segments.

As it is not currently being used for trading purposes it is not included within the segmental split of property, plant and equipment (see below).

Taxation matters are managed by the Group Financial Control team and are not segmented.

Inventories and biological assets are managed centrally by the Group procurement team. Inventories are usually stored at a Group location most appropriate for the supplier to deliver the goods to, usually the closest geographical location to the supplier. The inventories are then used in the delivery of goods and services to all segments within the Group.

During the year the Directors reviewed the segmental analysis of intangible assets. The Directors identified that certain intangible assets carried as `Processing' assets, were actually being supported by `Fresh' segment customers. This has been the case since the acquisition of Swancote Foods processing business. Given the challenges faced by Swancote Foods over the past two years and the importance of identifying any impairment risks (see Note 13), the Directors reviewed the intangible assets acquired with Swancote Foods and allocated them between Processing and Fresh, in line with the benefits that were expected to accrue from that acquisition. Consequently, the Directors have reallocated £4,992,000 from Processing to Fresh, representing the goodwill that was considered to be covered by Fresh business opportunities arising from the acquisition of Swancote Foods. This reallocation has been made in both the current and the prior year segment split.

The fair values above are attributable to consumable biological assets, where the Group has ownership of such assets at the reporting date. The fair values have been calculated as the present value of the net cashflows expected to be generated by harvested produce at the reporting date. The key assumptions used in determining the fair value have been as follows: ­­ Future costs of growing are based on forecast amounts. ­­ Selling prices for potatoes are based on management's estimate of the year's harvest prices. ­­ Ware yields between 5-23 tonnes per acre, depending on variety. ­­ Seed yields between 7-22 tonnes per acre, depending on variety. ­­ Daffodil bulb yields 6-20 tonnes per acre.
Certain biological assets are consumed and replanted as part of the Group's farming strategy (seed potatoes and daffodil bulbs). The determination of the selling price for these assets involves more estimation, but the Directors are satisfied that suitable active market prices are used in their valuation.
The biological assets represent the following: ­­ Crops of partially grown potato plants at each reporting date (£9.5m). ­­ Bulb stocks which may remain in the ground for between one and eight years, from which daffodils will grow at certain times of the
year, which will be dormant for the rest of the year (£11.5m).
Potato crops are usually planted between January and May each year, depending on the geography, variety and weather. Harvesting normally occurs between April and October. The Group plants between 4,500 and 7,500 acres with potato seed every growing season, with an expected yield of 60,000-100,000 tonnes of potatoes at harvest. This `own grown' harvest of potatoes supplements the external purchases required to meet the demands of the Group's customers. Financial risk is therefore restricted to the actual costs invested in the crop, and this is monitored regularly to ensure that there are no exposures in the asset base of the Group.
The Group has in the ground between 2,000 and 2,500 acres of bulb stocks, of which 150 to 350 acres are harvested and replanted each year. These biological assets provide daffodils for sale, bulbs for replanting and bulbs for sale. Financial risk is consistent with potato crops (see above). Given that 1,650-1,850 acres are ordinarily expected to remain in the ground for greater than one year, the value of bulbs which are not current assets is estimated to be £8.5m-£10.5m.
The fair value, less costs to sell, of produce harvested from biological assets during the period was £13,857,000 (2016: £19,852,000).
There are no restrictions on title of the crops growing in the ground. However, as part of HSBC Bank's overall charge on the assets of the business, the bank reserves the right to place a charge on all inventory of the Group, including biological assets, in the event that such security is required.
The Group had commitments at the reporting date of £1,500,000 (2016: £1,300,000) in respect of developing or acquiring biological assets. This represents land rents and planting costs payable during the remainder of the growing cycle.

The carrying amount of goodwill includes amounts attributable to the following; ­­ the acquisition of Swancote Foods (£0.6m) completed in July 2007 (Processing segment); ­­ customer access and processing synergies (`Synergies') arising in the Fresh segment resulting from the Swancote Foods acquisition
(£5.0m, Fresh segment); ­­ the acquisition of Rowe Farming (£6.4m) completed in October 2012 (Fresh segment); and ­­ the acquisition of The Jersey Royal Company (£0.9m) completed in May 2014 (Fresh segment).
The carrying amount of customer relationships (£2.6m) is attributable solely to the acquisition of Swancote Foods and relates to the customers acquired with that business. This is attributable entirely to the Processing segment.
The Group tests goodwill and the value of customer relationships for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently where impairment indicators exist, by comparing the carrying value of the cash-generating unit (CGU) with its value in use. Value in use is estimated based on future cash flow discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. An impairment charge arises where the carrying value exceeds the value in use.
The inputs into cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent budgets/forecasts approved and reviewed by the Directors for the following year and extended forward for the next four years based on expected growth within that CGU over that period. At the end of year five, a terminal value is calculated using a long-term growth assumption of 2%.
The key inputs to the cash flow forecasts are: ­­ forecasted changes in volumes (by consideration of future sales plans and production capacity); ­­ revenues (by management's growth estimates of revenue to existing and new customers based on an understanding of the needs
of those customers obtained through working relationships); ­­ cost of sales and direct costs (by assessing efficiency of processes and underlying anticipated purchase prices); ­­ future anticipated capital expenditure; and ­­ movements in working capital.

13 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED) Based upon the impairment tests performed, the Directors have concluded that there is no material impairment across any of the Group's goodwill or intangible assets. The key assumptions for each CGU, for which the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets allocated is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets of the Group, are as follows:

£0.47m 10% 9.5%

£0.67m 0%
9.5%

£1.93m 5%
9.5%

Comments in respect of each CGU and the key assumptions adopted are as follows:
Swancote Foods Since the contamination incident at Swancote Foods in May 2015 and the disruption to that business, the Directors continue to carefully monitor the Swancote recovery plan. The key issue for this facility is securing additional volume to take the facility back to and beyond the production volumes achieved prior to the contamination issue. The Directors continue to believe that this remains achievable.
Comments relative to the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are as follows: ­­ 2018 forecast EBIT of £470,000 is based on the latest forecasts prepared. This is higher than in the past two years, when Swancote has
been loss-making. The Directors are confident that this improved EBIT will be achieved due to a new customer that is expected to deliver a further 5,000T of processing and thus increase overall production to approximately 18,000T. At the date of approval of the annual report, the contract with this new customer is not yet signed but the Directors confirm that they expected this to be finalised during the remainder of 2017. ­­ EBIT growth of 10% from 2019 through to 2022 is expected to result from increased production volumes, primarily to existing customers, through broader product offering.
Synergies The Fresh business has benefited from the original Swancote acquisition through access to original Swancote customers and the processing of outsized potatoes. The revenue and savings from this original acquisition continue to be enjoyed by the Fresh business. The key assumptions, in the value in use calculation, reflect past experience and remain consistent with those used in previous periods.
Rowe Farming Limited Rowe Farming Limited's business has enjoyed significant growth of its capacity, sales volumes and asset base over the past three years against a backdrop of stagnant sales prices and margins in a number of markets. The Directors and management have reviewed the customer base and sales strategies on a customer by customer basis and identified a number of areas of development for the business in the short and medium term.
Comments relative to the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are as follows: ­­ 2018 forecast EBIT of £1.93m is based on the latest forecasts prepared and is significantly higher than the EBIT achieved in 2017.
However, this level of EBIT is at a level consistent and also below other years since acquisition. The Directors are confident that the increase in EBIT will be achieved through achievable increases in price, through pursuing new retail customers, and also due to adverse trading issues experienced in 2017 not being expected to recur. ­­ EBIT growth of 5% from 2019 through to 2022 is expected to be driven through increasing sales penetration into retail, and a shift away from wholesale.
Discount rate ­ all CGUs The discount rate of 9.5% has been determined based upon calculating the weighted average cost of capital for the Group with reference to comparable companies operating within the sector.

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

Sensitivity analysis As part of their overall review, the Directors have determined that there is a reasonably possible change in a key assumption that could give rise to an impairment for both Swancote Foods and Rowe Farming. The extent to which the value in use as calculated exceeds carrying amount is disclosed in the table above, together with the key assumptions.

The following table sets out each key assumption and the extent to which it would need to change (in isolation) to result in value in use equalling carrying amount for the Swancote Foods and Rowe Farming CGUs.

Key assumptions where a reasonably possible change could result in impairment:

£0.41m 6%

In performing this sensitivity analysis, the Directors note the relatively small headroom within the impairment tests and the reality that key assumptions need only change slightly to result in carrying amount equalling value in use.

14 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The Group from time to time uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on interest-bearing loans and borrowings, which mean the Group pays a fixed interest rate rather than being subject to fluctuations in the variable rate. The Group has not designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. These are aged in line with the maturity of the loans against which they were taken out. Consequently such derivatives are treated as current in these financial statements.

14 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (CONTINUED) Fair values The Directors do not consider there to be any material differences between the fair values and carrying values of any financial assets or liabilities recorded within these financial statements at the reporting date.

Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: ­­ Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; ­­ Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly
or indirectly; and ­­ Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable
market data.

At 1 July 2017, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

21 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a defined contribution stakeholder scheme and personal pension plan for various employees, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. Contributions to these defined contribution pension plans for the period amounted to £397,000 (2016: £475,000).

The Group also operates a Defined Benefits Scheme, the Greenvale Produce Pension Plan. The benefits provided by the Plan are final salary-defined benefits with the contributions paid by the Group on a balance of cost basis. The plan is run by the Trustees of the Plan who ensure that the Plan is run in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules of the Plan and complies with legislation. The Trustees are required by law to fund the Plan on prudent funding assumptions under the Trust Deed & Rules of the Plan. The contributions payable by the Group to fund the Plan are set by Trustees after consulting the Group. The assets of the Plan are invested in managed funds with Legal & General Investment Management. The Plan closed for all accrual on 31 October 2007.

The Trustees use the defined accrued benefits method for determining funding. This method is suitable for funding a scheme that is closed for future accrual. During the period ended 1 July 2017, the Group paid contributions at a rate of £46,000 per month, a total of £552,000 (2016: £552,000). This rate is subject to review on completion of the actuarial valuation currently being undertaken for the scheme as at 1 July 2016. In addition, the Group pays all of the costs of administering the Plan and any levies required by the Pensions Protection Fund and the Pensions Regulator.

The following list is not exhaustive but covers the main risks for the Plan. Some of the risks can be reduced by adjusting the funding strategy with the help of the Trustees, for example: investment matching risk. Other risks cannot easily be removed, for example: longevity risk, and the Group must be aware of these risks and ask the Trustees to monitor them closely.

Investment Return Risk: if the assets under perform returns assumed in setting funding targets, then additional contributions may be required. Investment Matching Risk: the Plan invests primarily in equity type assets. If equity type assets fall in value significantly, additional contributions may be required. Longevity Risk: if future improvements in mortality exceed the assumptions made then additional contributions may be required. Legislative Risk: Government may introduce overriding legislation which leads to an increase in the value of Plan benefits. Solvency Risk: as the funding target is not a solvency target, the assets of the Plan may not be sufficient to provide all members with the full value of their benefits on a Plan wind up.

21 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED) The Group expects to contribute at least £552,000 to the defined benefit pension plan in the year ended June 2018, assuming no changes to current agreed funding plans. The scheme Trustees are, however, in discussion with the Group in respect of the deficit reduction plan, and a new long-term plan is expected to be agreed during the year ended June 2018.

The Plan assets are held exclusively within instruments with quoted market prices in an active market with the exception of the holdings of cash. The Plan does not invest directly in property owned by the Group, or in shares issued by the Group.

No rate of increase in salaries is required as the scheme is closed for future accrual.

The mortality assumptions for 2017 follow the standard table known as S2NXA with CMI_2016 projection model with a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% p.a. For 2016, mortality assumptions followed the tables S1NMA (males) and S1NFA (females), projected by year of birth using the 2012 CMI mortality projection method with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1%. Assuming retirement at age 65, the life expectancy in years is now as follows:

Sensitivity analysis: The impact on the defined benefit obligation of changes in the significant assumptions, based on the 2013 actuarial valuation (the most recent valuation completed for the plan trustees prior to the current valuation work), is shown approximately below:

Assumption varied
As at 1 July 2017 Discount Rate 1% p.a. lower Inflation (in payment and deferment) rate 1% p.a. higher Life expectancy one year higher

Defined benefit obligation % change
+27% +25%
+5%

The figures assume that each assumption is changed independently of the others. Therefore, the disclosures are only a guide because the effect of changing more than one assumption is not cumulative. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 24 years.

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

22 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) Since 2007 the Group has operated an HMRC-approved CSOP scheme whereby share options were granted to key personnel within the business. Options vest if and when the Group's achieved profit before interest and taxation (PBIT) meets or exceeds a percentage of budgeted PBIT. Performance targets are split over three years. All option awards are broken into three separate and equal tranches to be measured against the actual results in each of the three years for which options have been granted.

The criteria for vesting options are as follows: ­­ If 100% of budget is met, all options available for that year vest. ­­ If, in years one and two, 80 to 100% of budget is met, that portion of the options available in that year vest, with the remaining vesting
in the following year provided PBIT target is met in full in the following year. ­­ If less than 80% of budget is met, no options vest. ­­ In the final year, if 80 to 100% of target is achieved, that portion of options will vest and the remaining options will lapse.

CSOP options were granted in October 2007, May 2009 and May 2010 to various key personnel. Vesting criteria were measured against the results of the Group between 2008 and 2014. As of 28 June 2014, all CSOP options granted have now either vested or lapsed. As such, there are not currently any charges to income in respect of these options. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There is no cash settlement alternative. The scheme allows for exercising of the options not earlier than three years after the option grant date, and not later than ten years after the option grant date. The expected life of the options is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.

Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) During the period ended 1 July 2017, options were granted to the incoming chairman as part of his remuneration package. These options were approved by shareholders at the AGM on 28 October 2016. The grant was for 454,545 options. The vesting of these options is conditional upon market conditions relating to the future share price. In the event these options vest, all options relating to this grant will be exercisable at an exercise price of £0.01. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There is no cash alternative. The expected life of the options is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. At the balance sheet date, these options have not yet vested but remain outstanding.

Senior Executive Incentive Plan (SEIP) During the period ended 25 June 2011, share options were granted to seven senior executives on flotation of the business onto AIM. This was a one-off event, where vesting was conditional solely on successful flotation. A total of 828,064 options were granted, each at an exercise price of £0.01. The options may be exercised at any point from one year after flotation date and not later than ten years from flotation date. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There is no cash alternative. The expected life of the options is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) During the period ended 1 July 2017, share options were granted to ten senior managers. Vesting was conditional on the achievement of certain performance targets. A total of 747,023 options were granted at an exercise price of £1.39. The weighted average exercise price of options granted in the period was £1.39. Options which vest may be exercised at any point from one year after the grant and not later than ten years from grant date. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There is no cash alternative. The expected life of the options is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. Targets for the year, however, were not met and all options granted in respect of this scheme therefore lapsed. Consequently, no options remain outstanding in respect of this grant, and no charge has been recorded in respect of these options.

Save As You Earn (SAYE) During the period ended 27 June 2015, the Group commenced an HMRC approved SAYE (Sharesave) scheme, which was open to all UK-based employees who had been in service for more than a year. Under this scheme, employees save a regular portion of their net pay for a period of three years. After three years, the employees are entitled to use their saved income to purchase shares at a pre-agreed discounted price. Alternatively, the employees can opt to have their savings returned to them as cash, along with any interest that HMRC may determine is payable from time to time. During the year to 27 June 2015, a total of 199,480 options were granted at an exercise price of £1.17. The scheme is of fixed duration, from June 2015 to June 2018, at which point the employees will have the choice to exercise their options, or recover their savings.

Charges in 2017 The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services rendered during the period ended 1 July 2017 is £280,000 (2016: £nil). All of this expense arises from equity share-based payment transactions. This is split as follows:

22 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS (CONTINUED) Valuation The fair value of all options granted during the current period has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model (2016: Black Scholes option pricing model) taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the 53 weeks ended 1 July 2017 and 52 weeks ended 25 June 2016, respectively.

The expected share price volatility has been derived from historic movements in the Produce Investments plc share price. The expected volatility reflects an assumption that historic share price volatility may be indicative of future trends. This may not reflect the actual future outcome.

Capital commitments At 1 July 2017, the Group had capital commitments of £463,000 (2016: £80,000).
Guarantees The Company has provided a composite cross-guarantee to its bankers in respect of bank borrowings with Group companies. At the end of the period the total bank borrowings of the Group companies amounted to £35,787,000 (2016: £18,871,000).
26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk associated with agricultural activities Agricultural activities such as potato growing have inherent risk related to planting, growing and harvesting and are subject to the vagaries of the weather. In order to mitigate the financial risk associated with growing and harvesting potatoes, the Group continues to invest in developing and selecting varieties that are resistant to disease and also seeks to utilise modern harvesting equipment which is less susceptible to adverse weather and lifting conditions. The Group also enters into fixed price potato contracts with growers for the majority of its procurement. This protects the raw material cost from market fluctuation in all but the most abnormal seasons.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks associated with interest rate, credit and liquidity risk. The Group has in place a risk management policy that seeks to minimise any adverse effect on the financial performance of the Group by continually monitoring the following risks:
Interest rate risk The Group's interest rate risk arises as a result both its long and short-term borrowing facilities. The Group will, when it considers appropriate, manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of fixed interest rate swaps and caps.
Foreign currency risk The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is not significant as primarily all of the Group's operating activities are denominated in pounds sterling.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its many customers. The Group has long-established policies and procedures for controlling customer credit risk. Credit limits are established for all customers based on internal rating criteria and are constantly reviewed and updated in accordance with the customer's latest financial position.
The Group operates a debts insurance policy, covering the larger non-retail customers. No claims have been made against the policy in the year.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk from its customers is £32,973,000 (2016: £27,793,000) as disclosed in Note 16 ­ trade and other receivables.
The Group regularly monitors and updates its cash flow forecasts to ensure it has sufficient and appropriate funds to meet its ongoing operational requirements whilst maintaining adequate headroom on its facilities to ensure no breach in its banking covenants.

Capital management Capital is the equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, sell assets, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash. EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before any significant non-recurring items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The gearing ratio at the period end was 2.13 (2016: 1.26).

COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 GENERAL INFORMATION Produce Investments plc (`the Company') and its subsidiaries (together `the Group') is a leading operator in the fresh potato and daffodil sectors. The Group has vertically integrated activities covering seed and bulb development, seed and bulb production, farming, processing/ packing, and supply of produce to the major retailers. The Company's subsidiaries are listed in Note 27.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. Its registered office is Floods Ferry Road, Doddington, March, Cambridgeshire, PE15 OUW.
The financial year represents 53 weeks to 1 July 2017 (prior year 52 weeks to 25 June 2016).
2 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES These separate Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 `The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (`FRS 102') and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, including the provisions of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £1,000.
Reduced disclosures The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from disclosing the following information in its Company only accounts, as permitted by the reduced disclosure regime within FRS 102: ­­ Section 4 `Statement of Financial Position' ­ Reconciliation of the opening and closing number of shares. ­­ Section 7 `Statement of Cash Flows' ­ Presentation of a Statement of Cash Flow and related notes and disclosures. ­­ Section 11 `Basic Financial Instruments' & Section 12 `Other Financial Instrument Issues' ­ Carrying amounts for financial instruments
measured at amortised cost or cost less impairment; interest income/expense and net gains/losses for financial instruments measured at amortised cost; loan defaults or breaches, and descriptions of hedging relationships. ­­ Section 26 `Share-based Payment' ­ Share-based payment expense charged to profit or loss, reconciliation of opening and closing number and weighted average exercise price of share options, how the fair value of options granted was measured, measurement and carrying amount of liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments, explanation of modifications to arrangements. ­­ Section 33 `Related Party Disclosures' ­ Compensation for key management personnel.
The financial statements of the Company are consolidated in the financial statements of Produce Investments plc. The consolidated financial statements of Produce Investments plc are available from its registered office, Floods Ferry Road, Doddington, March, Cambridgeshire, PE15 0UW.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for diminution in value.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the accounting date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Financing costs The financing costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Revenue recognition Revenue is derived from dividends from Group companies and is recognised when approved by the Board.

Overview Strategic Report Directors' Report Financial Statements

Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:

­­ Buildings

4 to 50 years

­­ Land is not depreciated

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. The assets' residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

Financial instruments Trade, Group and other creditors (including accruals) payable within one year that do not constitute a financing transaction are initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost, being transaction price less any amounts settled. Where the arrangement with a creditor constitutes a financing transaction, the creditor is initially measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar instrument and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Share-based payments The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. The fair value of equity options has been determined using either the Black Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation model.

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance criteria are satisfied.

At the balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management's best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in equity.

Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.

Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the profit and loss account for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the profit and loss account.

3 RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL PERIOD As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the parent company's profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements. The parent company's profit for the financial period was £5,573,000 (2016: £1,007,000 loss). The Company was a holding company in both periods and did not trade. The results reflect dividend income from the subsidiary companies, offset by the interest costs of servicing the loans reflected on the balance sheet and the administrative costs of running the Company.

Auditor fees for the period were £30,000 (2016: £30,000). These were settled by the main trading subsidiary, Greenvale AP Limited.

The only persons providing services to the Company were the Directors. The Directors' emoluments can be found on page 26.
