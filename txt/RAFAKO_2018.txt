The proprietary semi-dry flue gas desulfurization system engineered by RAFAKO S.A. is more cost-efficient than the wet method:
· In 2007-2008, at the Lód CHP Plant and Skawina Power Plant RAFAKO S.A. commissioned highefficiency flue gas desulfurization units made using the semi-dry method;
· The same technology was also used for the construction of a new CHP plant for Grupa Azoty Zaklady Azotowe Kdzierzyn S.A., commissioned in 2017;
· In 2015, RAFAKO S.A. signed a contract with ENEA Wytwarzanie Sp. z o.o. for the construction of a semidry flue gas desulfurization unit for K7 and K8 boilers at the Bialystok CHP Plant. The units were commissioned in September 2017, and final acceptance took place in March 2018.
In 2011, RAFAKO S.A. entered a new area of pro-environmental projects in the power sector, i.e. reduction of nitrogen oxides, as it commenced the manufacture of state-of-the-art SCR units on an EPC basis.
· Starting from June 2011, SCR systems were gradually deployed at units 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Kozienice Power Plant; the last system was commissioned in 2017.
· In 2012, a contract was signed with GDF SUEZ Energia Polska S.A. (currently Enea Elektrownia Polaniec S.A.) for the delivery of catalytic flue gas NOx reduction systems for five power generation units at the Polaniec Power Plant; The SCR systems for units 2, 3, 6, 7 were commissioned in 2016, and an SCR system for unit 4 was commissioned in 2018;
· In 2014, a consortium of RAFAKO S.A. and OMIS S.A. signed a contract with ENERGA Elektrownie Ostrolka S.A. for the construction of flue gas NOx reduction systems for units 1, 2 and 3 at Elektrownia Ostrolka S.A.; the common system for all units was completed in 2016, the separate system for units 2 and 3 was commissioned in 2017, and the last part of the project ­ the system for unit 1 ­ in September 2018.
In 2009, dust extraction equipment, including electrostatic precipitators and bag filters, was added to the Company's product offering. In 2010-2013, a number of electrostaTc precipitators were put in operaTon, including at units 10, 4, 3 and 8 at the Kozienice Power Plant; at a BB-1150 steam generator of units 4, 5 and 6 at the Belchatów Power Plant; as well as at unit 6 at the Tuzla CHP Plant. In 2014, two electrostatic precipitators were installed by RAFAKO S.A. at the Westfalen Power Plant in Germany, and further two at the Eemshaven Power Plant in the Netherlands. In December 2016, RAFAKO S.A. completed the upgrade of an electrostatic precipitator at the Morava CHP Plant in Serbia. In December 2018, the electrostatic precipitator at unit 1 at the Ostrolka Power Plant (the last part of the project to upgrade electrostatic precipitators at units 1, 2 and 3 at Energa Elektrownia Ostrolka S.A.) was placed in service.
2014 was a breakthrough year for RAFAKO S.A. A contract was signed for the construction of a 910 MW power generation unit at the Jaworzno III Power Plant, where the RAFAKO Group will execute this turn-key contract on a practically stand-alone basis and, in terms of technologies, will supply the entire boiler island.
In February 2014, the long-awaited contract for the extension of the Opole Power Plant came into effect. Under the contract, two new supercritical 900 MW power generating units are being built in what is the largest project in the Polish power sector since 1989. RAFAKO S.A.'s entire scope of work and services under the contract was subcontracted to Alstom Power Sp. z o.o. (currently GE Power Sp. z o.o.).
The projects are based on the state-of-the-art technology of electricity generation in supercritical steam generators and turbines, which increases the efficiency of generating units to 45% or more. In cooperation with Polish scientists, RAFAKO S.A. is continuously working on developing generating units with efficiencies in excess of 50% (ultra-supercritical units).

3.2. Revenue: amount and structure
In 2018, revenue from sales of products, merchandise and materials was PLN 643,313 thousand, having increased year on year by PLN 26,682 thousand (or 4.3%). Revenue from sales of products and services amounted to PLN 640,517 thousand, while revenue from sales of materials was PLN 2,796 thousand.
The sales growth recorded in 2018 was mainly driven by further progress of ongoing projects, including the contract to construct a biomass-fired co-generation unit for UAB VILNIAUS KOGENERACINE JEGAINE of Lithuania.
Sales on the domestic market fell in 2018 by 19.3 pp compared with 2017. The drop was mainly related to power generation units and steam generators, whose sales fell by PLN 46,228 thousand year on year, and to the Jaworzno 910 MW unit construction project, which generated revenue lower by PLN 47,449 thousand compared with a year earlier. On the other hand, sales grew by PLN 13,702 thousand and PLN 5,377 thousand, respectively, in the air pollution control systems and oil and gas segments.
In 2018, export sales rose by PLN 116,965 thousand, to PLN 266,719 thousand (up by as much as 78.1% year on year). Exports accounted for 41.5% of total sales, up by 17.2 pp year on year.
The increase in export sales was seen mainly in power generating units and steam generators, power equipment, machinery, components and associated services, and oil and gas segments. Sales of power generation units and steam generators amounted to PLN 142,108 thousand (PLN 23,674 thousand in 2017), and rose by nearly fivefold compared with the previous year. The sales increase in this segment is mainly related to the performance of the contract in Vilnius. Revenue from sales of power equipment, machinery, components and associated services totalled PLN 99,971 thousand and were 36.4% higher year on year. Sales in the oil and gas segment, in which the Company actively participates since 2018, amounted to PLN 23,452 thousand.
In 2018, the sales structure was as follows:

Jaworzno 910MW 10%

Air pollution control systems 42%

Power equipment, machinery and

In 2018, the Company's supplier structure was highly fragmented as none of the suppliers represented more than 10% of the total value of purchases.
RAFAKO S.A. relies on external suppliers for various services ­ delivery and assembly of machinery and equipment, construction and installation services and transport, as well as pipes, metal sheets, shaped materials, welding materials and specialist equipment. The range of purchases depends on the nature and requirements of individual projects. The Company's operations are not affected by limited availability of production materials, supplies or procurement services. Suppliers are chosen based on their ability to provide materials and equipment that meet the relevant technical and quality standards by specified deadlines and in the most cost-effective manner. The procurement process is based on market analysis, with the pool of suppliers including only manufacturers recognised for the quality of their products and compliance with the safety, environmental and other relevant standards.
With some contracts, the list of potential manufacturers and service providers must be approved by RAFAKO S.A.'s employers.
3.4. Related-party transactions
In 2018, the Company did not enter into any material transactions with related parties on non-arm's length terms.
For a detailed list of related-party transactions in 2018, see Note 43 to the full-year financial statements of the Company for 2018.
3.5. Amount and structure of operating expenses and gross profit/(loss)
In 2018, cost of sales of products, services and materials totalled PLN 581,416 thousand which, on revenue of PLN 643,313 thousand, translated into a gross profit of PLN 61,897 thousand, up by PLN 8,584 thousand year on year.
The year-on-year increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to a higher gross margin generated in 2018.

Growth prospects

The gross margin went up to 9.6% from 8.6% in 2017.

In 2018, distribution costs were PLN 24,053 thousand, having decreased by PLN 8,190 thousand year on year. The main reasons behind this decline were lower costs of bid preparation, lower costs of promotion and advertising, and lower salaries and wages.

3.7. Income: amount and structure
In 2018, the Company recorded positive performance across all levels of the statement of profit or loss:
1. gross profit was PLN 61,897 thousand, compared with PLN 53,313 thousand in 2017,
2. operating profit was PLN 3,703 thousand, compared with a PLN 37,110 thousand loss reported in 2017,
3. net profit was PLN 4,302 thousand, compared with a PLN 64,105 thousand net loss reported in 2017.
The Company did not publish any financial forecasts or profit guidance for 2018.
For the structure and change of pre-tax profit/(loss) in 2018, see Appendix 4.
3.8. Margins and ROE
In 2018, gross margin rose to 9.6% and was 1 pp higher than in 2017, while operating margin came in at 0.6% (6% in 2017).
As the Company generated a net profit (PLN 4,302 thousand), return on equity was positive at 1.1%. In 2017, return on equity was negative at -16.3%.
The 2018, 2016 and 2017 margins are presented in Appendix 1.
3.9. Financial liquidity
The current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) fell slightly, by 0.01, to 1.38. The current ratio is considered safe when it ranges between 1.2 and 2.0.
In 2018, the average collection period for trade receivables shortened by 11 days year on year (to 101 days), but the average collection period for amounts due from customers for construction contract work extended by 35 days (to 115 days). Inventory turnover changed only slightly and was 18 days. The average payment period for trade payables shortened by 10 days (to 109 days), while the average payment period for amounts due to customers for construction contract work extended considerably by 57 days (to 82 days).
The Company was able to maintain its financial liquidity chiefly due to the rigorous and consistent application of its rules of payment to subcontractors and efficient collection of receivables from customers.
In 2018, the Company continued its multi-purpose credit facility agreement with PKO BP S.A., whereby the bank granted the Company a multi-purpose credit facility for the financing of its day-to-day operations. In June 2018, an annex to the credit facility agreement was signed, extending the availability period of the facility. For detailed information on the amendments, see Section III.4 `Other material events.'
The use of a bank credit facility and long-term lease contracts with interest rates based on the 1M WIBOR reference rate plus margin (the Company did not have any commercial borrowings) affects the borrowing costs. Any potential changes in interest rates on such instruments, or higher margins on credit instruments offered by banks, affect the level of the Company's finance costs, but did not pose any threat to its business in that period.
In terms of financial liquidity, the need to engage substantial cash to secure contract bonds (performance bonds, advance payment guarantees, bid bonds), provided by financial institutions, is a significant burden on the Company.
Ultimately, the Company seeks to have all of its contractual obligations secured exclusively with financial guarantees (with assignment of receivables under the contract as security in respect of the Company's obligations towards financial institutions). Such security arrangements will allow the Company to freely manage its own financial resources and avoid using these resources directly as security, which will improve the Company's financial liquidity.

Access to new bank/insurance guarantees will be of paramount importance for the Group to be able to maintain liquidity. Unavailability of a satisfactory amount of guarantee limits may restrict the Company's ability to conclude revenue-generating contracts. In 2018, RAFAKO S.A. secured new guarantee limits totalling approximately PLN 110m.
The Company is also exposed to currency risk. Changes in PLN exchange rates, especially if frequent and significant, may materially affect both the profitability of contracts and the amount of currency translation differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and translated into PLN.
The Company's currency risk management strategy provides for the use of natural hedging to the extent possible. The Company seeks to achieve the highest possible level of structural matching of income and expenses denominated in the same currency and related to the running contracts. Apart from natural hedging, the Company may hedge between 30% and 70% of its net exposure to foreign exchange risk by means of derivative instruments (e.g. FX forwards) available on the market. In the second half of 2017, the Company entered into futures/forward transactions to hedge the USD/PLN exchange rate risk. As at December 31st 2017, the Company had open hedging positions for a total amount of USD 4m.The transactions were accounted for in the first half of 2018. In 2018, the Company did not enter into any new transactions hedging foreign exchange risk. As at December 31st 2018, the Company had no open hedging positions. The Company does not apply hedge accounting.
For the objectives and rules of financial risk management, see Note 46 to the financial statements for 2018.
3.10. Debt
In 2018, RAFAKO S.A.'s liabilities towards its creditors increased by PLN 12,657 thousand. As at December 31st 2018, total non-current and current liabilities were PLN 523,309 thousand, compared with PLN 510,652 thousand as at December 31st 2017.
The increase in liabilities was mainly attributable to the PLN 93,177 thousand increase in current amounts due to customers for construction contract work. At the same time, other current liabilities decreased by PLN 42,549 thousand. Non-current liabilities fell by PLN 4,503 thousand year on year.
As at December 31st 2018, the Company's assets not encumbered with on-balance-sheet (non-current and current) liabilities amounted to PLN 394,426 thousand, compared with PLN 393,250 thousand as at December 31st 2017.
The debt (non-current and current liabilities) to assets ratio rose slightly to 57%, from 56.5% in 2017.
Debt to assets ratio does not take account of the Company's contingent liabilities under bank and insurance guarantees (mainly performance bonds and advance payment guarantees granted on the Group's instructions; such guarantees are typical for RAFAKO S.A.'s business and the market of power generation equipment), letters of credit and promissory notes issued as security. As at December 31st 2018, the Company's contingent liabilities under these instruments totalled PLN 1,676,531 thousand (PLN 1,629,882 thousand as at December 31st 2017). The main item of these liabilities was a surety of PLN 1,237,935 thousand issued for the benefit of financial institutions which provided financial security in respect of the Jaworzno 910 MW Project; the surety was provided to secure proper discharge of obligations by the Jaworzno project SPV in connection with financial guarantee agreements.
In the 12 months of 2018, a number of guarantees were issued by banks and insurance companies to trading partners upon RAFAKO S.A.'s instructions, including performance bonds of PLN 76,985 thousand, advance payment guarantees of PLN 68,569 thousand and bid bonds of PLN 64,405 thousand. The largest item of contingent liabilities was an advance payment guarantee of EUR 10,326 thousand issued in December 2018.
In connection with its ongoing contracts, besides contingent (off-balance-sheet) liabilities, the Company also had contingent receivables, which amounted to PLN 290,178 thousand as at December 31st 2018 (PLN 201,584 thousand as at December 31st 2017). The main item of these receivables were bank and insurance guarantees totalling PLN 226,019 thousand as at the end of 2018 (PLN 182,715 as at the end of 2017).
For details of changes in contingent receivables and liabilities, see Note 40 to the financial statements for 2018.
The 2018 and 2017 liquidity and debt ratios are presented in Appendix 1.

IV. Growth prospects
1. Energy policy
The energy market
The Company's core market is the domestic and international energy market.
This market, and its commercial segment in particular, are heavily regulated in terms of their current organisation, future development and structure in the context of the increasingly stringent environmental protection standards. The regulated nature of the industry follows from the power market's strategic importance to the energy security of every country, with environmental protection and reduced CO2 emissions becoming a global priority in international relations. Such regulations include both the legislative framework and general objectives of the national and EU-level energy policies in terms of environmental protection.
Because of the introduction of more stringent environmental protection standards, businesses generating flue gases, such as CHP plants and power plants, are required to upgrade their existing units and install new equipment to reduce air emissions. As a result, the number of new projects in the power segment is growing, including construction of low-emission, high-efficiency power plants and upgrades to the existing energy sources to ensure their compliance with the strict environmental requirements imposed under EU laws, which stimulates demand for the products and services offered by RAFAKO S.A.
The EU's energy policy is formulated by Member States as well as EU institutions. The legal basis for the energy policy is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, key objectives of the EU's energy policy are to:
· Ensure the functioning of the energy market;
· Ensure security of energy supply in the Union;
· Promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy;
· Promote the interconnection of energy networks.
The current energy policy provides for a comprehensive and integrated approach to energy and climate policy. In 2014, the heads of EU Member States and governments set the following goals:
· Greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 by at least 40% compared with 1990,
· Increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU's energy consumption,
· Increasing energy efficiency by at least 27% (indicative) in 2030.
In November 2016, the European Commission presented a package of measures (Winter Package) to keep the European Union competitive as the clean energy transition is changing the energy markets.
On July 31st 2017, the European Commission issued a communication on Best Available Techniques for large combustion plants (BAT LCP), i.e. those whose capacity is above or equal to 50 MW. BAT conclusions will be binding for a number of power plants and CHP plants in Europe, and thus in Poland. BAT conclusions provide a reference for setting emission and monitoring standards in integrated permits under which combustion plants operate. The deadline for ensuring compliance with the BAT conclusions is four years from the date of their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, i.e. mid-2021.
The key legal act regulating the operation of the Polish energy sector is the Energy Law. It lays down the rules governing the development of the energy policy, the rules and conditions for the supply and use of fuels and energy, including heat, and operation of energy companies.

Growth prospects

Poland's Energy Policy until 2040, prepared by the Ministry of Economy, plays a major role in setting the development directions for the energy sector. The objectives set out in the draft document include:
· 60% share of coal in electricity generation by 2030;
· 21% share of RES in final gross energy consumption by 2030;
· implementation of nuclear power generation by 2033;
· 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 (relative to the 1990 level);
· 23% increase in energy efficiency by 2030 (relative to the 2007 primary energy forecast).
The need to diversify the structure of electricity generation will contribute to reducing the share of coal in Poland's energy mix, but in absolute (quantitative) terms a major shift in the use of coal as a fuel by commercial power plants in the next decade or so is unlikely.
Utilisation of non-agricultural waste for energy generation should increase, With sludge, industrial waste meeting the statutory definition of hazardous waste (including hospital waste) and municipal waste offering the biggest potential.
At the beginning of January 2016, a Transitional National Plan (TNP) was introduced in Poland under a regulation of the Minister of Environment of July 2015. The Plan is designed to implement the provisions of the Industrial Emissions Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 2010 (IED) into the Polish legal system. The Directive introduces mechanisms that make it possible to postpone compliance with the obligation to apply new emission limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust (derogations). Derogations provide the operators of energy installations with time to complete investment projects designed to technically adapt them to the more stringent emission requirements. One of the mechanisms introduced by the IED is the Transitional National Plan, applicable in the period from January 1st 2016 to June 30th 2020. During that period, the installations covered by the Plan will have to meet the relevant emission ceilings set for each year.
In 2016, the President of Poland signed the Energy Efficiency Act, which implements EU regulations into Polish law to further improve the energy efficiency of the Polish economy. The Act came into force on October 1st 2016. Under the Act, certain entities are required to conduct an energy efficiency audit every four years. The energy efficiency audit is a procedure whose purpose is to carry out detailed and validated calculations with regard to proposed implementation of projects contributing to an improvement in energy efficiency and to provide information on potential energy savings.
On December 6th 2017, the Sejm (lower house of the Polish Parliament) enacted the Capacity Market Act. The capacity market is expected to guarantee the availability of sufficient demand-driven capacities of electricitygenerating sources. The purpose of the new legislation is to address the generation capacity shortages resulting from an expected increase in peak demand for capacity and electricity on the one hand, and from considerable number of generating units scheduled for decommissioning on the other hand. The Act introduces a new model for a centralised capacity market. In this model, a central buyer (the transmission system operator) acquires an obligation from capacity providers to provide, and keep ready to provide the system with sufficient capacity in certain situations. This capacity obligation is offered by capacity providers: generators, energy storage facilities and some electricity consumers, as well as entities representing groups of generators or consumers (so-called aggregators), in auctions.
On June 29th 2018, the President of Poland signed a government bill to amend the Renewable Energy Sources Act. The new regulations are expected to enable a more effective utilisation of renewable energy sources and meeting of international obligations. The main objective of the amendment is to ensure full compatibility between the provisions of the Renewable Energy Sources Act of February 20th 2015 and state aid legislation, to which Poland has committed itself to the European Commission in the notification procedure, and to bring the regulations in line with EU requirements.
Oil and gas market

General information

Economic and financial condition

Key developments

Growth prospects

In line with its strategy adopted in early 2018, RAFAKO S.A. also intends to focus on the oil and gas sector, both in Poland and on an international scale. This is seen as a promising market in view of the expected multi-billion investments in this sector, mainly relating to the implementation of Poland's energy policy objectives. The projects include but are not limited to the construction of gas stations, transmission pipelines, underground gas storage facilities, and gas compressor stations for the construction of natural gas and oil production facilities.
The demand for natural gas will be growing as it can be used as fuel in power plants and generates lower emissions relative to other fossil fuels.
The gas market in Poland is regulated by the Energy Regulatory Office. In line with its decision, Gaz-System S.A. has been and will be the Transmission System Operator in Poland from October 2010 until the end of 2030. Its main task is to develop the existing transmission system to ensure the long-term ability of the gas system to meet the legitimate needs for transmission of gas fuels in domestic and cross-border trade by expanding the system and, where applicable, by expanding interconnections with other gas systems.
Diversification of gas supply directions and sources is to be achieved through the following two key projects:
· construction of the Northern Gate,
· expansion of connections with the neighbouring countries.
This will create favourable conditions for developing a gas transmission and trade centre in Poland for CEE and Baltic countries.
An expansion of the national network and storage infrastructure is also necessary. Th expansion of the national gas transmission system in the coming years (until 2022, with a perspective until 2027) focuses on developing the network:
· in the western, southern and south-eastern parts of Poland (from winoujcie to connections with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Ukraine),
· in the north-eastern part of Poland (to the connection with Lithuania).
Another aspect of the national network development is the expansion of distribution facilities. At present, Poland's gas grid coverage is 58%. The rate is planned to be increased to 61% by 2022. Particular emphasis has been placed on covering the areas which are currently off the gas grid. In the long term, the distribution network will be developed and upgraded in line with market needs. Where it would be unreasonable to lay a gas pipeline, LNG regasification stations will be used to supply gas to distribution zones off the grid.
Currently, seven underground gas storage facilities cooperating with the existing transmission system are used in Poland, Gas Storage Poland Sp. z o.o., wholly-owned by PGNiG S.A., acts as the storage system operator for all storage facilities.
Additionally, Gaz-System S.A. owns 15 gas compressor stations, which are linked to the transmission network and located all over Poland. Five more compressor stations are located on the Polish section of the Yamal pipeline and operated by EuRoPol GAZ S.A.
In the coming years, the infrastructure in this area is going to be expanded both in Poland and in Europe.
The oil market involves mostly crude oil transmission, storage, distribution and trading.
Most fuel pipelines in Poland are owned by PERN S.A., a state-owned joint-stock company. In the near future, further development of the pipeline network and expansion of crude oil storage capacities are to be expected.
2. Investment plans
According to the conclusions from forecast analyses performed for the purposes of Poland's Energy Policy until 2040, demand for electricity in Poland is expected to grow. Poland's economy consumes nearly 170 TWh of electricity, with imports and exports used for balancing purposes. The installed capacity in the National Power System exceeds 41 GW, of which more than 32 GW is attributable to main activity power plants (using mainly

hard coal and lignite as fuel). More than 6.4 GW of the installed capacity is based on RES (mainly wind farms), with the balance (approximately 2.6 GW) attributable to autoporducer power plants (using various fuels). In the next dozen or so years (especially after 2029) a significant part of the currently operated generating units will be decommissioned. This process is driven by the wear and tear of power generating units and tightening of the EU environmental standards. The increase in demand for electricity will be covered by sources other than conventional hard coal- and lignite-fired power plants. To meet the growing demand for electricity, in view of the significant decommissioning prospects, the capacity market has been implemented as an investment stimulus to ensure the stability of supplies.
Factoring in the phase-out of existing capacities in the Polish power system, the maximum net capacity of the country's generating units is expected to increase to 46.4 GW or so in 2030. A capacity decline is expected for coal-fired power plants, while the capacities of renewable energy power plants (mainly wind, biogas and biomass-fired power plants) and nuclear power plants are expected to increase.
The PGE Group is implementing two major investment projects: construction of new units at the Opole Power Plant (2x900MW), and construction of a 450 MW lignite-fired unit at the Turów Power Plant. In the longer term, the company is contemplating the construction of two new gas-fired 700 MW CCGT units at the Dolna Odra Power Plant.
The Tauron Group has been building a 910MW unit at the Jaworzno Power Plant and a 450MW combined-cycle unit at the Stalowa Wola CHP Plant. In addition, the company invests in distribution activities, connecting new customers and generating facilities to the network, and plans to implement projects involving improvements in safety and quality of electricity supply to customers.
The Enea Group and the Energa Group are building the 1,000 MW Ostrolka C Power Plant. Moreover, Enea is carrying out a feasibility study for the construction of a 540 MW IGCC unit near Bogdanka. Enea is also working on a feasibility study for an RDF-fired power generation unit which would replace the existing 200 MW unit in Polaniec, for which derogation has been obtained. The Group's expenditure on upgrading production assets in 2019-2023 is projected to reach approximately PLN 1bn, of which approximately PLN 500m will be spent on harmonisation with BAT conclusions. In 2019-2023, power generating units with a total capacity of 4,700 MW are to be upgraded, of which 2,046 MW are to be upgraded in 2019-2021.
Apart from the construction of Unit C at the Ostrolka power plant, the Energa Group announced an invitation to tender for the construction of a new 450­750 MW CCGT unit in Grudzidz.
The programme for construction of municipal waste incineration plants, launched in 2007 and included on the Indicative List of the Ministry of Regional Development under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment, envisaged the construction of 12 municipal waste incineration plants: in Szczecin, Koszalin, Pozna, Gdask, Olsztyn, Bialystok, Bydgoszcz, Lód, Warsaw, Kraków and two facilities in Silesia. Currently, there are already 7 waste incineration plants in operation in Poland (in Warsaw, Bialystok, Bydgoszcz, Konin, Kraków, Pozna, Szczecin). Further local governments (including but not limited to those in Gdask, Olsztyn, and Wroclaw) are contemplating the construction of such facilities.
Also the PGNiG Group has plans to invest in generation capacity (through Polska Spólka Gazownictwa). Some of the funds will be allocated for the connection of new users, construction of new and upgrades of existing gas distribution networks, connection of new areas to the gas network, investments in infrastructure accompanying the development of gas distribution networks, such as communication, metering, ICT. The projects will include the construction of LNG regasification stations in the Grajewo, Moki, Augustów, Czyew and Hajnówka municipalities. Further, the Bialystok gas pipeline will be redeveloped and a gas distribution network will be built in Bielsko Podlaskie.
Gaz-System plans capital expenditure of PLN 11bn in 2019­2022. In the 2020­2029 Development Plan, GazSystem envisages more than 30 major projects, which will increase the length of the national transmission network from 11,000 km to approximately 14,800 km. The document sets two time horizons: until 2023 and until 2029. In the first one, the ongoing investment programmes defined in the previous plan for 2018­2027 are to be continued. The programmes include in particular those related to diversification of natural gas supplies to Poland, that is the Baltic Pipe programme, expansion of the LNG terminal in winoujcie, construction of a

connection with Lithuania, and construction of the North-South Corridor, which includes opening a connection with Slovakia. The second time horizon (until 2029) will be the time for carrying out investment projects whose implementation will depend on the development of gas markets in Poland and the region.
The PERN Group's business consists in the operation of the pipeline network, storage and distribution of crude oil and petroleum products, including fuels. In January 2019, the PERN General Meeting approved a Long-Term Strategic Plan for 2018­2022, which provides for the Group's capital expenditure of PLN 2.7bn. The strategy also provides for increasing the scale of PERN's operations and ensuring a stable increase in revenue and financial resources for the execution of key projects. The investment plan for the coming years envisages the construction of new storage tanks for fuels and crude oil, as well as new pipelines, including the second line of the Pomorski reverse pipeline with a length of over 240 km, transmitting crude oil along the Plock-Gdask-Plock route, and the Boronów-Trzebinia product pipeline with a length of almost 100 km from, supplying fuels to the Silesian Agglomeration.
Major growth projects have also been announced by the ORLEN Group, including the expansion of the Plock and Wloclawek plants. The ORLEN Group's CAPEX budget for 2019­2020 will average PLN 6.8bn annually.
On February 22nd 2019, the Sejm (lower house of the Polish parliament) passed a special act on preparing and implementing strategic projects in the oil sector. The new act, which simplifies the procedures for obtaining the necessary administrative approvals, is designed to facilitate the preparation and, consequently, the implementation of the projects strategic to Poland's energy security, such as the construction and upgrade of oil and fuel pipelines.

3. Competitive environment

RAFAKO S.A. operates on a market dominated by large, mainly international players. On this market, contracts are typically awarded through tenders announced by clients, and projects usually take several years to complete.
Given the significance of factors such as experience, credentials, technological capabilities and financial resources in bidding for new contracts, the Company faces a limited number of competitors, which are typically companies specialising in EPC projects. In line with market requirements, a majority of the Company's projects are also implemented under EPC contracts.
There is considerable competition in terms of the products and services which are part of EPC projects. Each company which the Company considers a significant competitor has proprietary energy generation technologies, extensive credentials and many years of experience in delivering EPC contracts. While some of them specialise in specific types of steam generators, others offer a comparable range of products and have access to technologies allowing them to bid for contracts within the same product scope as RAFAKO S.A. Complete generating units are constructed by: GE Power, Alstom Power Systems, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Doosan Power Systems, COVEC, CNEEC, Amec Foster Wheeler, CNIM, all of which have proprietary energy generation technologies, as well as organisational capacities necessary to carry out EPC projects. These companies, as well as RAFAKO S.A., offer products necessary to construct complete generating units that can run on any kind of fuel.
On the Polish market, there are several companies, such as Warbud, Budimex and Polimex Mostostal, which plan to enter the power construction industry by including EPC contracts into their offering or, at the very least, by offering assembly and construction services. Developing capabilities necessary to design and manufacture equipment for the power sector is complicated and requires considerable expenditures over long periods of time. They compete against RAFAKO S.A. relying solely on technologies and products supplied by the aforementioned direct competitors.
With respect to specific products, such as steam generators, desulfurization units, NOx reduction units and waste incineration facilities, main competitors of RAFAKO S.A. are again GE Power, Alstom Power Systems, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Doosan Power Systems, Amec Foster Wheeler, SES Tlmace, Hitachi Zosen Inova, and CNIM, as well as Andritz, Valmet and Strabag.
The market is also seeing a number of Chinese companies, whose competitive edge consists primarily in lower prices and different - uncertain in the Company's opinion - technical specificaTons. RAFAKO S.A. believes that

Growth prospects

customers on the Polish and European markets, including Turkey, perceive the offering of Chinese companies as unreliable, but the situation may well change if the Chinese competitors are able to maintain low prices while improving the technological quality of their products. Then those companies may become important players on the market of electricity generation technologies.
Furthermore, given the nature of large EPC contracts, it cannot be ruled out that RAFAKO S.A. will partner with the above-mentioned companies for certain projects, especially those consisting in the supply of steam generators, their pressurised components or flue gas desulfurization units.
4. The RAFAKO Group's strategy
Considering the shifts and trends prevailing in the Company's core market, including declining investment in conventional energy projects (chiefly in new large generating units in Poland), including 2018 RAFAKO decided to update its strategy and expand its operations to include EPC and general contracting services for the gas and oil sector. This growth direction is to diversify revenue sources and ensure further development of the Group's business. Following this decision, the RAFAKO Group's core and strategic business segments comprise the power construction segment and the gas and oil segment.
RAFAKO's strategy is to deliver long-term growth in the Company's value by building Poland's largest provider of specialised technological solutions to the power sector and the oil and gas industry in Poland and abroad.
The Group conducts its business taking into account corporate social responsibility standards, with respect for the natural environment, in compliance with ethical principles, and with care for the employees' and customers' satisfaction.
The Group's strategic objectives are to:
· Strengthen its position in the domestic power construction market by delivering and participating in the largest capital investment projects in Poland, capturing a market share in the market for services related to the modernisation of heat and power infrastructure, and ensuring compliance with BAT regulations;
· Increase its share in the oil and gas market by participating in projects to construct transmission, production and processing infrastructure;
· Expand operations in foreign markets in both of the Group's strategic segments;
· Develop the technologies it applies, particularly its proprietary technologies;
· Improve profitability through control and mitigation of project risks;
· Achieve dividend distribution capacity in 2020.
These objectives are feasible provided the Group is properly organised and focused on the provision of EPC project management and general contracting services in both strategic business segments. Internal reorganisation of the Group will, on the one hand, involve acquisition of EPC capabilities in the oil and gas sector, and on the other ­ separation of services from the manufacturing operations through a spin-off of an organised part of the RAFAKO Group's business, namely the Steam Generator Plant. The acquisition of capabilities in the oil and gas sector will be effected by transferring to RAFAKO Engineering an organised part of business spun off from PBG (i.e. the entity surviving the planned merger of PBG with PBG Oil and Gas). The change in the previously announced structure of the planned transaction involving transfer of capabilities in the oil and gas sector to the RAFAKO Group has been made following a formal and legal analysis. This solution is optimal and beneficial to the surviving entity due to PBG Oil and Gas's existing obligations under the PBG restructuring documents to which PBG Oil and Gas is a party.
Power construction segment
RAFAKO has been operating in the power sector since 1949, designing, manufacturing and supplying steam generators and environmental protection facilities, including under EPC contracts, for this sector. RAFAKO owns end-to-end technology for the construction of traditional generating units and is among Europe's largest

Growth prospects

manufacturers of steam generators and environmental protection facilities for the power sector. RAFAKO is the undisputed leader of the Polish market for power generation equipment. In line with the adopted strategy, the operations of the RAFAKO Group in the power sector are expected to significantly boost the Group's revenue. In the near future, the Group intends to focus on further developing and improving its capabilities relevant to EPC and general contracting services in the power sector through the participation in and execution of the largest projects in Poland, as well as participation in projects executed on foreign markets. Given the Group's experience as well as the solutions and technologies it offers, the Group also plans to actively participate in the market for modernisation of heat and power infrastructure, in particular 200 MW and smaller generating units, and in the market for modernisation of environmental protection facilities in accordance with the IED (Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions) and BAT (Best Available Techniques). Given its proprietary technologies and credentials, RAFAKO is well prepared to take part in such tenders and meet market expectations.
In 2019, the RAFAKO Group plans to bid for power construction contracts with a total estimated value in excess of PLN 5bn. In these tenders, contracts are to be awarded for the construction of generating units and waste thermal treatment plants, construction and delivery or modernisation of steam generators and related facilities, as well as construction and upgrade of existing FGD, SCR and dust removal units.
Oil and gas segment
The reasons for RAFAKO's entry into this strategic segment of the PBG Group's operations include primarily the market environment, growth prospects, and opportunities to use of the Group's potential. The experience, credentials and know-how acquired by PBG during more than 25 years of its operations in this specialist construction services market will be concentrated within the RAFAKO Group. Historically, the PBG Group was the leader of this market in Poland and the implementation of multi-billion projects enabled the Group to obtain unique credentials that can be now used in tenders and which represent an added value for the entire Group. The credentials include experience as a general contractor in turnkey projects covering the design, delivery, assembly, construction and commissioning of the complete LMG (Lubiatów-Midzychód-Grotów) oil and gas production facility, a power plant worth PLN 1,397m (VAT exclusive), and unique experience in implementing a turnkey project to construct an LNG terminal, with a value of PLN 2,368m (VAT exclusive). The LubiatówMidzychód-Grotów facility is the largest oil and gas production facility in Poland with production capacities reaching 1,300 tonnes of crude oil per day and 35,000 Nm3 of gas per hour. Since 2013, PBG Oil and Gas has also been playing an important role in the PBG Group's operations in the oil and gas segment. In 2017, PBG Oil and Gas successfully completed the construction of the Radoszyn production facility. It is the third largest oil and gas production facility in Poland, with the production capacity reaching 80 tonnes of crude oil per day. Thanks to its active participation in the market and contract performance, PBG Oil and Gas has the competencies in managing projects at each stage of execution. These competences include planning of design, production and construction work necessary to execute an entire project, and comprehensive management of the supply chain and logistics to ensure timely delivery and high quality of products and services. The company also has the important experience and competencies related to the start-up and commissioning of projects. After the merger of PBG Oil and Gas with PBG, an organised part of business ("OPB") having the capabilities listed above will be spun off from the merged entity and included in the RAFAKO Group.
The RAFAKO Group intends to actively participate in the market of investment projects related to gas and oil production and to the development and modernisation of gas networks in Poland and abroad. The Group is interested in participating in projects of key importance to Poland's energy security, related to the expansion of underground gas and oil storage facilities and distribution infrastructure, including gas compressor stations.
In 2019, the Group plans to bid for contracts in the oil and gas segment with a total estimated value of PLN 2.7bn. Tenders in this segment mainly relate to installations for liquefying natural gas and LNG storage, compressor stations, gas pipelines, gas production facilities, and modernisation of existing installations and facilities.
RAFAKO's objective for 2019 is to win new orders worth between PLN 800m and PLN 1bn in the two strategic business segments.
Development of the Group's solutions, especially proprietary technologies
