BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To the Shareholders:
In 2011, the Group continued to deliver successfully its strategic development strategy across the international marketplace, building up its global licensee network and, across the homeland, carrying forward with determination its programmed distribution channel reshaping. Honed as a result of the forceful developed were commercial results of excellence, which can be even more appreciated when viewed against the national and international market backdrop harshly dented, since the past four years, by anemic and evaporating consumption. In a nutshell, the key operational and financial performance indicators for 2011:
 as developed around the globe, Licensee Aggregate Sales up 15% year-over-year to Euro 422 million (FY10: Euro 367 million);
 performance of excellence echoing across the international marketplace, with standouts being Asia and Oceania (+78%) and the Middle East and Africa (+19%);
 royalty income and sourcing commission up 17.2% year-over-year to Euro 38 million (FY10: Euro 33 million);
 77 new sales outlets unveiled in Italy over the course of FY11. Upbeat sales (+20% year-over-year) at single-branded shops and stores across the homeland (with Same-Stores Sales steady);
 Group net financial indebtedness mirrors a bolt-on 9.6% improvement. Reflecting growth at Euro 41.5 million are BasicNet, the parent company, available funds.
International commercial growth echoed pleasingly across the revenue-producing component, which mirrors royalty income and sourcing commission up 17.2% from the year before, stretching forward from Euro 33 million at year-end 2010 to Euro 38 million at year-end 2011, whether due to portfolio new brands spiking bolt-on territorial reach or historic brand sales volumes harnessing organic growth.
Consolidated direct sales, mainly from the homeland, amount to Euro 122 million (FY10: Euro 132 million). Primarily denting the aggregate was the crushing reality of constrained consumption and resultant financial turmoil across the distribution section in Italy, as sharpening over the course of FY11. Against this backdrop, the Group carried forward with determination its programmed distribution channel reshaping, with a keen eye steered toward switching from small-sized multi-branded shops and stores to Group-banner single-branded shops and stores. As a result of the new sales outlets unveiled over the course of the year, the total number of Group-banner single-branded shops and stores operating across the homeland stretched out to reach 257 at year-end 2011, thereby churning out franchising channel sales revenue growth in the range of 20% or more year-over-year and a substantially steady volume of Same-Stores Sales on a constant perimeter basis. The increased volumes delivered by the Group-banner shops and stores helped to recuperate to some extent only the sales revenue lost by the multi-branded sales outlets, due to some sales revenue having to be forsaken insofar as mired in multi-pronged and excessive credit risk.
The key performance indicators place in evidence trading profit allied by a consistently stronger operational and financial base.
As delivered by the parent company, Trading Profit reflects 72% growth, moving from Euro 4.7 million at year-end 2010 to Euro 8.2 million at year-end 2011. As at December 31, 2011, Adjusted Net Income (before the Euro 4.5 million investee impairment recorded for reasons of prudence) amounts to Euro 12.7 million (December 31, 2010: Euro 10.4 million).
Detailed below are the financial performance indicators as adopted herein: Direct sales revenue: direct sales revenue plus royalty income and sourcing commission on purchasing EBITDA: operating margin before depreciation and amortization EBIT: operating margin

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FY2011 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AT A GLANCE
The International Marketplace
The quantum leap taken by business across the international marketplace created a stronger platform from which to forge significant commercial arrangements for new territories and, not least, to evolve a number of existing partnerships for strategic-embedded territories, delivering important commercial results and earnings and, above all, compounding brand development both on the shorter or longer horizon.
Inked in respect of Kappa® brand and the Robe di Kappa® brand was an all-new licensing agreement for the territorial landscape embracing Russia, the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakistan. Also inked in respect of those brands was an all-new licensing agreement for the Philippines whilst a branded underwear distribution licensing agreement was assigned for the European territorial landscape. Also seeing renewal in 2011 were brand licensing agreements for the Middle East, Hong Kong, Malta and Czech Republic territories, whilst distribution for the United States, Canada, Brazil, Panama, Peru, Colombia, Chile, Australia and New Zealand was repositioned through primary partners.
Inked in 1H2011 was an all-new Superga® brand licensing agreement for the North American markets. Also signed and sealed for that brand were licensing agreements across the territorial landscape embracing Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, China and Hong Kong, whilst seeing renewal, through a newly identified licensee, were brand licensing arrangements for Brazil.
Looking at the K-Way® brand, renewed in 2011 was its licensing agreement for the territorial landscape embracing North America and Canada, where sales continued to spike out-performance alongside bolt-on brand breadth and depth, with an all-new licensing agreement being inked for Switzerland. Also forged in 2011 were arrangements built around creating and distributing a new line of K-Way® branded luggage.
Looking at the Lanzera® brand, seeing renewal for a three-year period was its licensing agreement for the North America and Canadian territorial landscape, across which sales were driven unrelentingly upward by the continued momentum of the brand.
Revisited over the course of 2011 were commercial relations with the Moscow-based Bosco dei Ciliegi Group, which provide for agreements built around developing the Bosco apparel collections, whether in terms of the Russian teams set to compete at the London Olympic Games 2012 and the Sochi (Russia) Olympics 2014 or the collection earmarked for the Bosco shops and stores scattered across the Russian territorial landscape.
The Italian Marketplace
Locked into a self-defeating cycle of austerity, the Italian marketplace in 2011 came face to face with higher commodity prices and rising pressure on consumers' disposable incomes, which continued to evaporate up to 4Q2011 when political events and the draconian nature of the initiatives introduced to redress public finance imbalances, compelled consumers already reluctant to spend to bend to the need for harsher frugality. Against this backdrop, BasicNet's strategy was crafted around stretching out to consumers primarily through its Group-banner shops and stores, staying one step ahead of distribution channel evolution and reaching the endcustomer directly.
Accordingly, the Group remained strongly committed to unveiling Plug@Sell® sales outlets, which offer to multi-brand small shopkeepers an ideal solution for staying one-step ahead of evolution, with the attendant consequence being more keenly matched distribution and production resources, coupled with clear focus on the flexibility and standards set by the BasicNet business model. Ringed around powerful technological and computer-system platforms, the business model is primed toward offering a "business-in-a-box" opportunity to shopkeepers. An opportunity that enables a shopkeeper to remain more tightly focused on sales, all f which to the benefit of supporting commercial development without having to worry about investing or contending with working capital risk.
The BasicNet business model also sets its sights on investing toward product fit-out at sales outlets and, where operated and managed directly, investing toward fixed assets and human resources. Capital investment ploughed into financing the new sales outlets unveiled in 2011 amounted to some Euro 2.4 million, as well as investing toward computer-system solutions built around creating a centralized operating management platform.

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unveiled across the homeland in 2011 were 77 Group-banner shops and stores, and one Group-banner maiden store in Greece, with the attendant consequence being a capillary presence of the shops and stores flying Group banners at December 31, 2011 stretching out to reach 257 in number.
Given the economic environment currently prevailing, this strategy led to some earnings having to be forsaken also in relation to more aggressive competitive selling prices. At the same time, however, this strategy worked toward retaining market share and market foothold, thereby churning sales revenue growth in the range of 20% or more year-over-year and a substantial steady volume of Same-Stores Sales.
Sponsorships & Communication
Bolding stepping ahead throughout the review period was brand promotion nurtured by press campaigns and sponsorships. Stirring exciting acclaim across the international and national press was the cooperation forged between BasicNet and the American stylist Marc Jacobs, which led to a co-branded innovative K-Way Classic, distributed around the globe in Marc Jacobs premium stores, as well as the arrangements reached with New Balance in respect of launching the famous NB 402 model in co-branding with K-Way®.
Looking at the world of sport at the national level, other than the individual yachting events and an ad hoc collection created for the staff of the Tour of Italy 2011, forged over the course of the year were arrangements in respect of the technical sponsorship of the F.C. Cagliari football team. A landmark event unfolding into the onset of a collaboration that stretches beyond the customary supply of merchandize to encompass Groupbranded franchising development across the territory. Also signed and sealed in 2011 was a sponsorship contract with FISI (Winter Sports Italian Federation). By way of attendant consequence thereof, Groupbranded technical clothing will be supplied to all the teams competing in the differing winter sports disciplines, thereby driving through particularly significant brand visibility at the forthcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi (Russia) and, not least, the Olympic Games to be held successively in South Korea.
At the international level, seeing onset were important football team sponsorships with the Toulouse Football Club (France), the Sporting Gijon (Spain), the Black Leopard FC (South Africa), the Bulgarian National Football Team and the Jamaican National Football Team, as well as with countless football teams in Thailand, South Korea and the Arab Emirates.
Looking at events correlated to the K-Way Gallery, regaining breath of life in May 2011 at Turin Polytechnic University, after 35 years from its market debut, was the Apple 1. Unveiled in December 2011 at Turin was the "Steve Jobs 1955-2011" exhibition, the first cultural insight in Italy dedicated to the inventor and cofounder of the Apple.
New Brands
In October, BasicNet subscribed to a share capital increase in Fashion S.p.A., the titleholder to the Sabelt® brand for the fashion merchandize categories (apparel and footwear), partaking with a 50% stakeholding. Insofar as the brand's exclusive world licensee, BasicNet S.p.A. will make available its business model and all the specific applications resulting therefrom, as already made available in the past for the other more recently acquired brands.
Joining forces with K-Way® and Jesus®, the latter relaunched through a toxic-free Denim Collection, the Sabelt® brand helps to shine a light on the BasicNet Group's all-new Fashion segment.

Taken as a whole, Licensee Aggregate Sales grew some 15% year-over-year. The aggregate echoes robust growth by the Asian markets, with sales revenue stretching out to reach Euro 90 million, or 78% more than the year before. Echoing across the territorial landscape embracing the Middle East and Africa was 19% growth, despite the impact caused by political disruption across the North African territory in 2011, hence confirming its role as the new business development hub. Reflecting 3% growth from the year before was the territorial landscape embracing North and South America, where distribution repositioning reached completion part way 2011 through new partners, whether for the United States and Canada or for Brazil.

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
International commercial growth echoed pleasingly on the earnings component, with Royalty Income and Sourcing Commission gaining 17% headway from the year before, moving from Euro 32.5 at December 31, 2010 to Euro 38 million at December 31, 2011. Largely contributing to the year-on-year increase was royalty income inasmuch as sourcing commission streams were less vibrant year-over-year, due to destocking by certain European licensees who, in consequence, downsized their sourcing and procurement.
Consolidated Sales Revenue delivered for FY11 amounts to Euro 122 million (FY10: Euro 132 million). As placed in evidence earlier, Consolidated Sales Revenue bears the brunt of anemic consumer spending and testing financial conditions across the distribution sector in Italy, as sharpening throughout the year under review. Indeed, mirroring a decline was sales revenue from multi-branded shops and stores, continuing to be adopted in respect of which was a selective credit concentration policy, which, for reasons of prudence, involves relinquishing portions of turnover growth mired by excessive credit risk. As far as sales at singlebranded shops and stores are concerned, sales revenue instead gained 20% headway from the year before, also as a result of the new shops and stores unveiled in the review period.
Over the last twelve months, the Trading Margin on Direct Sales retreated from Euro 52.8 million at December 31, 2010 to Euro 45.4 million at December 31, 2011. The year-on-year decline results, particularly in 1H2011, from the unfavorable foreign followed by currencies and by sourcing costs due to surges in the cost of merchandize and/or the cost of labor. As from 2H2011, the Group remains committed to sourcing center reshaping to the benefit of licensees. Expressed in terms of percentage on the value of the sales put in place by the Italian licensee, marginality staged, moreover, a recovery in the year under review, climbing from 36.3% at March 31, 2011 to 37.2% at December 31, 2011.
Other income at December 31, 2011 came to Euro 3.3 million (December 31, 2010: some Euro 3.5 million) and relates to income delivered through marketing contributions and, not least, rental income and other fees and income received in respect of temporary licenses.
Looking at overhead, Media and sponsorship costs grew from some Euro 16.9 million at December 31, 2010 to some Euro 18 million, or 7.5% more than the year before, being a reflection of the new sponsorships sealed in 2H2011.
Over the last twelve months, the Cost of labor moved forward from Euro 15 million to some Euro 16 million (or +9%), thereby rising upward to account for 13.4% (December 31, 2010: 11.5%) when taken as a percentage of sales revenue. As at December 31, 2011, the Group employed 458 people (December 31, 2010; 440 people), or 18 full-time equivalents more than the year before. Primarily pushing through organic growth year-over-year were new Group-banner shops and stores unveiled across the homeland and, not least, stronger operational structures at the parent company resulting from commercial and design & prototyping development also in relation to the new Fashion line to which the K-Way®, Sabelt® and Jesus Jeans® brand activity has been aggregated.
Selling expenses and general & administrative retreated from Euro 33.9 million at December 31, 2010 to Euro 32 million at December 31, 2011, or 5.8% less than the year before. In line with the prior year, the reserve for the write-down of receivables, provisioned in the amount of Euro 2.2 million, increases on a percentage basis by reference to the value of the receivables in portfolio, insofar as having provided, on a comparative basis with the year-earlier period, a greater amount to cover exposure to any insolvency risk driven through by the current liquidity crunch also denting the shopkeeper system in Italy.
EBITDA at December 31, 2011 was Euro 20.4 million (December 31, 2010: Euro 23.1 million).
Amounting to some Euro 5.9 million at December 31, 2011, Depreciation and Amortization, including therein the depreciation of equipment and other assets held under finance lease, retreated 8.4% from the year before. Also reflected under this account line is the Euro 242 thousand impairment adjustment recorded for reasons of prudence in relation to the items of key money recognized to unrelated parties in respect of the Italian market sales outlets.

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

EBIT at December 31, 2011 was Euro 14.5 million (December 31, 2010: Euro 16.7 million).
Over the last twelve months, Finance income/(expenses), Net, including therein foreign exchange gains/(losses), moved from Euro 4.2 million at December 31, 2010 to Euro 3.8 million at December 31, 2011. Driving through the meaningful improvement was the substantially breakeven net foreign exchange balance recorded for the year (December 31, 2010: Euro 0.6 foreign exchange loss). The result reported is correlated to the hedging transactions entered over the course of 2H2010 and replicated in respect of maturity profiles relative to the current period. Conversely, the balance on finance expenses from the servicing of debt, and only from the servicing of debt, increased Euro 03 million, as a result of the change in the interest rate spreads occurring in the review period.
The Result before Taxation at December 31, 2011 was Euro 10.7 million, whilst Group Net Profit stretched beyond Euro 8 million (Euro 8.1 million as opposed to Euro 8.5 million in 2010).
Income taxes include current income tax and deferred income tax. The deferred tax assets relate to significant timing differences arising on the provisions recorded for reasons of prudence primarily in respect of receivables and inventory and for sales revenue restated under IFRS, totaling some Euro 13 million, which will be recovered financially in future accounting periods, as discussed in the Notes.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The operating and financial data included in the separate financial statements of the parent company resonate the business development examined and discussed at the level of the consolidated financial statements and, more specifically, with regard to the operating segment built around trademark and license operational management.
Direct sales revenue and Other income gained 16% headway, increasing from Euro 8.4 million to Euro 9.8 million. Other income at December 31, 2011 came to Euro 6.8 million and includes intragroup support service fees charged to BasicItalia S.p.A., Basic Trademark S.A., Superga Trademark S.A. and Basic Village S.p.A. for an amount totaling Euro 6.6 million.
Overhead remains substantially in line with the year before. Amounting to Euro 9.6 million, EBITDA grew Euro 3.2 million from the year before (December 31, 2010: Euro 6.4 million), hence reflecting totally revenue growth. After provisioning depreciation and amortization in the amount of Euro 1.5 million, EBIT harnessed 72.2% sparkling growth year-over-year at Euro 8.2 million.
Distributed to BasicNet S.p.A. by the subsidiary BasicProperties B.V. were dividends in the amount of Euro 7.5 million as a result of the financial proceeds resulting from the dividends paid by the Group companies, as held by the latter.

As discussed earlier, the critical challenges posed by the Italian marketplace, the investee's key market outlet, set the need for meaningful investment in terms of profitability relinquished in order to embed the commercial footprint goals and objectives linked to the market shares captured, waging at the same time a strategy crafted around reshaping the distribution channels, the beneficial effects of which are not expected to unfold on the immediate horizon. As performed in the manner discussed in the Notes, the impairment test culminated into the investee's carrying amount being written down.
After provisioning current and deferred taxation in the amount of Euro 3.1 million, the Net result delivered for the year was some Euro 8.2 million positive (December 31, 2010: Euro 10.4 million).

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. The BasicNet Business System
The BasicNet Group has modeled its development around a business-to-business "network" platform, identifying the licensee as the ideal partner for proliferating, distributing and sourcing its products around the globe and approaching the licensee not just in the role of a product provider but in the role of a fully-fledged integrated services provider with a multi-pronged offering, or, should we say, with opportunities for business.
Innovative, flexible and modular, the BasicNet Business System has enabled the Group to grow rapidly, while retaining a lean and agile structure: a great business cascading into a myriad of businesses interconnected by a single data-rich digital platform entirely integrated to the Network via Internet and studied for real-time sharing and maximum data exploitation.
Also, the BasicNet Business System has been conceived and structured in such a way as to allow development headroom for internal lines (new licensees and new markets) and for external lines (new brands developed or acquired, and new lines of business).
The manner in which the Business System functions is extremely simple. Helmed by the BasicNet Group are the following strategic activities:
o product research and development; o global marketing; o Information Technology, i.e. the creation of new software enabling on-line management of all the
processes along the offering chain; o coordination of manufacturing and commercial data streams exchanged within the Licensee Network;
and o strategic finance.
Entrusted to the licensees, according to territorial base or specific merchandize category, is product distribution to retailers, local marketing, territorial logistics and working capital funding.
Identical model has been replicated in respect of manufacturing licensees (Sourcing Centers) tasked with managing the production flows of BasicNet branded finished products, which are distributed to the commercial licensees in their relative areas of competence.
As part of developing its Business System, the Group has also created the system of direct sales to the general public, for the time being developed primarily by the Italian Licensee (BasicItalia S.p.A.), which is held directly. The Retail Business Model responds to the Plug&Sell philosophy; in other words, a web-integrated sales management system equipped with a business platform having the capability to operate and manage all the day-to-day activities of a shop in real time, from orders to inventory management and from accounting to staff training (pre-opening and continuative), and always on-line.
Looking at the BasicItalia Retail Project, differing banners have been developed and assigned to the three primary retail levels (store formats) through which the Group enters into the market of direct sale to the general public across the homeland. More pointedly:
- (FIRST LEVEL OR STORE FORMAT): single-branded shops located in historical centers, highstreets or shopping centers with specific franchising arrangements;
- (SECOND LEVEL OR STORE FORMAT): Brand Outlets located in Outlet Villages;
- (THIRD LEVEL OR STORE FORMAT): "alloSpaccio" discount stores located in trade-converted commercial or industrial parks.
15

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All three of the store formats have been developed in a strategic design to replicate in number and diverse market conditions.
3. Web Integration
The IT platform represents one of the Group's key strategic investments to which a keen eye is steered, whether in terms of human resources or Business System development flagship.
The IT platform has been conceived and developed with clear focus posed on seamless Web integration, as interpreted by the Group to be the ideal tool enabling communication between the elements making up the Network.
In consequence, the Information Technology division is engaged in designing and implementing electronic data processing and transmission systems enabling link-up between BasicNet Network licensees and within or outside the organization.
Against this background, the business format has been designed and underscored by e-processes, i.e. ".com" divisions, each one of which plugs into the production process and exchanges or negotiates with other divisions, all of which on-line.
GROUP STRUCTURE
The Group is structured around International and Italian operational companies grouped into three operating segments:
- license operational management (Business System);
- proprietary licensees; and
- property operational management.
The Business System operating segment includes: the parent BasicNet S.p.A.; the companies with proprietary title to the trademarks of Basic Trademark S.A. and Superga Trademark S.A., both of which headquartered in Luxembourg, operating with a homeland branch; AnziBesson Trademark S.r.l.; Fashion S.p.A.; the services company BasicNet Asia Ltd., headquartered in Hong Kong; Basic Properties B.V. in the Netherlands, and; the sub-licensee companies Basic Spain S.L. in Spain, and Basic Properties America, Inc. in the USA.
Other than the activity developed directly by BasicNet S.p.A., as discussed earlier, the activity pursued by the other companies culminates into granting under concession BasicNet Group intellectual property rights to the diverse licensees, administering and managing the related contracts and royalty streams resulting therefrom.
Proprietary Licensees are represented by BasicItalia S.p.A. and its subsidiaries.
BasicItalia S.p.A. operates as licensee for the utilization and development of BasicNet intellectual property rights and all branded products for the Italian territory. This is the licensee and `incubator' for testing Group development projects.
BasicItalia S.p.A. is titleholder to important technical sponsorship and merchandizing contracts, also at international visibility level, which also work toward the benefit of the Group and the Network.
Through its subsidiaries RdK0 S.r.l., alloSpaccio S.r.l. and BasicOutlet S.r.l., BasicItalia also operates and manages a number of franchised retail outlets operating under the Group banners. Through BasicCRS S.r.l., BasicItalia provides services relating to or arising from Group branded product sales and aftermarket sales.

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Property operational management is helmed by Basic Village S.p.A. The latter is proprietor to the production facilities formerly owned by Maglificio Calzificio Torinese. Renovated in 1998 by way of property preservation, this is where the BasicNet Group is headquartered and where other operations, whether Group or otherwise, are housed.
PRIORITIES AND GROWTH HEADROOM
The Group's primary objective is to strengthen its leadership position at the global level identifying opportunities to enhance the value of trademarks. The Group pursues all this by:
- compounding and broadening proprietary trademark footprint across the assigned territorial landscape, through steps taken to support licensee business growth on a Business System consistent basis;
- broadening trademark territorial reach through steps taken to seek out qualified new licensees, especially in respect of the more recently acquired brands;
- the Retail Project enabling licensees to enhance their market presence and, moreover, to reach endcustomer more effectively; and
- examining new opportunities for new market development and investment.

Primarily pushing through year-on-year organic growth (18 full-time equivalents) were the directly managed and operated new sales outlets unveiled over the course of the year and the stronger Basicsample.com structure, as built up in relation in the Fashion new entry. Also nominated in the year under review were three managers.
Carried forward successfully over the last twelve months was the BasicEducation Project steered toward training on-line personnel to bring greater focus and coordination to our franchising activities and, as part of nurturing tomorrow's talent, to develop the capabilities that the Human Resources of the Group are going to need in the future:
 991 hours of on-line distance training (without tutor);  3,500 hours of training with student tutor or at pilot shops and stores;  672 trained students (employees and franchisees).
As fine-tuned over the passage of time, put in place back in 2004 were certain steps designed toward finding the right working patterns to meet the needs of the Group while achieving a good work/life balance its employees: Banca-ore enables employees to make a more flexible use of overtime; reversing Part Time made available to employee mothers with small children; BasicCare desk where employee day-to-day errands and payments can be delegated to a BasicCare staff member, and; BasicGym, which organizes, with effect from September 2011, gym courses for Group employees and team members.
In February 2012, BasicNet inked a protocol of understanding with the Municipality of Turin, by virtue of which all the «human resources» of the BasicNet Group can access the TorinoFacile services, the City of Turin's on-line services counter, «without having to leave their workdesk». In fact, by entering the Company's website (www.basic.net), the employees are recognized on log-in without having to digit their Tax I.D. Number or other passwords to attain access to the service, thereby enabling them to request the anagraphic or civil status certificates they or their family members need without having to book an appointment with the respective municipal offices.
Industrial health and safety are values shared by all the human resources. In acknowledgement thereof, the parent company and its subsidiaries have drawn out the "Measuring Risk Report" required under Italian Decree-Law 81/2008.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
Protecting the environment represents a key factor for the competitiveness and sustainability of the Group. Protecting the environment essentially unfolds into ensuring that the Group makes the lightest possible impact on the environment and observe local environmental requirements. Through Web Integration, the Group's governing objective since 1999 is to avoid the use of paper: indeed, the IT platform is the one and only means of communication between the elements making up the Network, from procedure control to HR administration, thereby reducing to a minimum the use of paper. Also, the Group uses a scanner archive system throughout the operating cycle, scanning almost all mandatory accounting records and ledgers and, not least, payroll management documents.
MAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
As a global business, the BasicNet Group is subject to a variety of risks identifiable at the strategic, market and financial level, as well as other risks arising in the normal course of business.
Strategy Risk This arises from factors that might compromise the valorization of the trademarks that the Group implements through its Business System. The Group must guarantee the capability to identify new business opportunities and territorial development opportunities identifying structurally appropriate Licensees for each and every market. The Group is structured to monitor on-line the operations conducted by its licensees and, moreover, to detect eventual anomalies in the operational management of the trademarks for the differing territories.
Risk associated with General Economic Conditions The Group retains that its Business System has the flexibility needed to rise swiftly to the challenges posed by muted consumer tastes or by a localized and confined consumer slowdown. However, the Group may be exposed to periods of deep economic recession or deteriorating credit markets that could reshape consumer propensity and, more generally, that could reshape the economic environment of reference.
Foreign Exchange Risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk either arising from merchandize purchases or royalty income and sourcing commission billed to licensees and sourcing centers outside Euroland. Most of those items of income are denominated in U.S. dollars and, to a marginal extent, in Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. The risk arising from fluctuations in the U.S. dollar on product purchasing prices are measured, on a preliminary basis, when drawing out budgets and finished product price-lists, so as to cut-off the effect that such fluctuations might have on selling profit margins. Successively, as part of Group centralized treasury and cash pooling ordinary activities, cash inflows denominated in foreign currency, arising from royalty income and sourcing commission collected, are used to finance merchandize payment outflows denominated in foreign currency. Cash outflows denominated in foreign currency not hedged by cash inflows, or in circumstances where collections and payments are significantly staggered, hedging transactions are put in place using forward contracts on foreign currency purchases or sales. Group policy prohibits speculative transactions, and no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Credit Risk Group trade receivables stem from royalty income and sourcing commission billed to Sourcing Centers or revenues from the sale of merchandize. Royalty income receivable is mainly secured by bank guarantees, letters of credit or guarantee deposits, released by licensees. On a par basis, sourcing income receivable is secured by debtor outflows by the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A. to the relevant Sourcing Centers. Receivables from Italian footwear and apparel retailers, helmed by the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A., are monitored continually by a credit assessment team, in collaboration with credit rating firms and Regional Credit Assessment Centers across the territory, upon customer-order award. As covered by insurance, foreign trade accounts receivable by the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A., arising from Superga or K-Way® branded merchandize sold across Europe, are collected by a qualified credit collection agency.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Receivables from single-branded store franchisees are settled weekly on a basis consistent with the merchandize they sell, and not exposed to insolvency risk.
Liquidity Risk The sector in which the Group operates is exposed to seasonal bias, the effects of which unfold from when the merchandize is sourced until such merchandize is sold, especially in the case of products purchased in markets where, although the costs of production might be more favorable, the lead time is much longer. Such seasonal bias also impacts the Group's financial cycle. Medium to long-term loan facilities and the guarantee received by way of securing the Rome FC sponsorship contract are subject to key financial performance indicators (covenants), the non-observance of which could result in the loan facility or guarantee being withdrawn. The covenants have been duly observed Short-term debt, which finances the commercial activity, is represented by "financing on imports" and "selfliquidating bank advances", whether secured by commercial portfolio or current account exports. The Group manages liquidity risk by controlling the items making up working capital items with a keen eye steered toward monitoring the level of inventory, receivables, supplier payables and treasury. As reviewed by top management, liquidity risk reporting is made in real time or, where applicable, on a monthly basis or, as may be needed, more frequently.
Interest Rate Risk Where applicable, exposure to interest rate fluctuations on medium-term loans and financing has been mitigated by swapping variable rates of interest into fixed.
Risks associated with Tax or Legal Litigation The Group may be party to tax or legal disputes relating to critical issues differing in nature, and subject to the jurisdiction of diverse countries or states. Given the uncertainty inherent thereto, it is difficult to predict with certainty the financial outlay that could result therefrom. Furthermore, the Group is defendant in lawsuits undertaken to protect its Brands or its products against counterfeiting. Lawsuits and litigation undertaken against the Group frequently stem from complex legal issues, which are subject to a differing degree of uncertainty, including therein the facts and circumstances inherent to the individual lawsuit or litigation, the jurisdiction and the differing applicable laws. In the normal course of business, Management consults with its legal and/or tax advisors. The Group makes provision for a liability in respect of eventual lawsuits or litigation when a financial outlay is deemed to be more likely than not and when the amount of the losses that would arise therefrom can be reasonably estimated. By judgment pronounced on February 29, 2012, the Court of Milan accepted the action to obtain revocation pursuant to Section 2901 of the Italian Civil Code and Section 66 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law - Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 ­ requested by the bankruptcy trustee (i.e. official receiver) of Formula Sport Group S.r.l. in relation to the K-Way® trademark deed of acquisition signed on January 31, 2004 with Formula Sport Group S.r.l. at that time in bonis, under the aegis of the Court of Monza pending before which was admission to a pre-bankruptcy procedure by the said Formula Sport Group S.r.l., as subsequently filed. As referred to above, the judgment given in first instance declared the aforesaid K-Way® trademark deed of acquisition to be ineffective solely with respect to Formula Sport Group S.r.l. (in bankruptcy). It therefore follows that proprietary title to the K-Way® trademark remains vested, pending completion of all legal remedies, in the Company. The judgment was pronounced in the wake of a judgment within which the Company challenged firmly the assumptions for the action to obtain revocation placing, among the other things, in evidence ­ based on documentary evidence ­ the absence of prejudice to the creditors of Formula Sport Group S.r.l., also taking into account the fairness of the purchase price consideration paid. In consequence, strong in the belief that the judgment is based on erroneous and, under multi-pronged aspects, censurable argumentation, the Company believes, based on the opinions expressed by its legal advisors and consultants, that there are valid reasons, whether substantive or judicial, to retain that the judgment will be overturned, upon court of appeal hearing, and, as such, the related risk, if any, arising therefrom is deemed to be remote in nature.
As part of its business activity, BasicNet and some Group companies are currently subject to tax reassessment, in respect of which no quantification can be made at the time of writing with regard to any factual findings.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD Proposed part way March 2012 to Fashion Network S.p.A., undergoing bankruptcy in the interim period, was acquisition of the business line operating and managing a string of outlets and factory outlet stores. The proposal provides for the acquisition of 22 multi-branded sales outlets, 13 and 9 of which are Outlets and Factory Outlet Stores, respectively, in exchange for a purchase price consideration of Euro 440 thousand; the proposal also provides for the acquisition of inventory extant at the sales outlets in exchange for a price consideration of Euro 950 thousand and, not least, for taking over no more than 60 of the staff members employed at those sales outlets. The proposal arrangements provide for a business line rental period taking effect from March 2012 and up to the date on which the assigning judiciary auction takes place, in respect of which there is a pre-emption right. Should the proposal be accepted, the Group would gain a significantly bolder footprint across the Italian outlet center landscape, thereby accelerating the franchising project thrust. Unveiled across the homeland in 1Q2012 was 1 RDK® stores and 9 Superga® Shop stores, whilst unveiled across the Greek territorial landscape was 1 RDK® store and 2 Superga® Shop stores.
BUSINESS PROSPECTS In the months that lie ahead, the Group will continue to focus on building up the Production & Commercial Licensee Network with a keen eye steered toward maximizing the advantages unfolding from the network's seamless and capillary market reach, all of which in a strategic intent to assure bolt-on royalty and sourcing commission streams. Looking at the Italian market, the business transaction crafted around the Fashion Network new outlets provides for full-rate operations after, and only after, eventual business line award. Along with slowing demand across the homeland, this condition will echo its way across the Group income statements for FH2012, placing in evidence an expected comeback in the second half of the year. Whilst consensus expectation for the year as a whole remains difficult to define, the step-actions put in place to regain profitable sales in Italy and organic growth for the licensing international activities, FY2012 hopefully continues to transpire a positive tone.

OTHER INFORMATION
TREASURY SHARES
Based upon the programmed purchases of treasury shares, authorized by the Annual General Meeting held on April 29, 2011, and effective until the Annual General Meeting approves the Annual Report & Accounts 2011, the number of shares purchased as treasury shares by the Company under that authority was 426,500 (or 0.699% of share capital) at the Board meeting date.

The Group shall carry forward in the year ahead the programmed treasury share purchases, submitting to the Annual General Meeting the proposed authorization renewal.

STOCK OPTION SCHEME DISCLOSURES At the time of writing, no Stock Option Schemes whatever are in place.
SHARES HELD BY DIRECTORS AND STATUTORY AUDITORS Information about the shares held by Directors and Statutory Auditors can be found in the Remuneration Report. Along with the AGM 2012 documentation, the Remuneration Report can be accessed through the BasicNet Group website at www.basicnet.com.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the period, there were no transactions, including intragroup, with related parties which qualified as unusual or atypical. Any related party transaction formed part of the normal business activities of the Group. Such transactions are concluded at standard market terms for the nature of the goods and/or services offered. Information about related party transactions can be found in Note 39 to the separate financial statements. Intragroup transactions, which substantiate into merchandize purchased and services rendered, are neither designated as atypical nor unusual, and fall within the normal course of business conducted by the BasicNet Group companies. Intragroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation. The effects arising from transactions between BasicNet S.p.A. and its subsidiaries are placed in evidence in the parent company's separate financial statements and in the related Notes thereto. The Board of Directors approved on October 29, 2010 the procedure relating to transactions with related parties, the related content of which is summarized in the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structures. The integral version of the procedure may also be accessed through the BasicNet Group website (www.basicnet.com under BasicNet Corporate Governance).
MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION BasicNet S.p.A. is not subject to management and coordination pursuant to Article 2497 et seq. of the Italian Civil Code and has independent decision-making powers to govern its financial and operating policy decisions. BasicNet S.p.A. is not subject to management and coordination by Basic World S.r.l., the company that holds a 36.187% stake in share capital, inasmuch no restriction whatever exists, whether defined by contract or through organizational procedures, on the independent decision-making powers of BasicNet S.p.A. Pursuant to Article 2497-bis of the Italian Civil Code, its Italian subsidiaries, whether held directly or indirectly, have identified BasicNet S.p.A. as the entity exercising management and coordination. This activity consists in indicating the general strategic and operating guidelines of the Group and takes tangible form in the definition and updating of the System of Internal Control and the Corporate Governance model, and ensuring observance of the Code of Conduct & Best Practices applied Groupwide. In addition thereto, coordination of the Group, again with reference to the Italian companies of the Group, provides for centralized management at BasicNet S.p.A. of treasury or cash pooling, personnel, corporate and accounting internal audit and Information Technology. The foregoing enables economies of scale, and appropriate management control and coordination.

Each slate shall list one candidate at least having the requisite of independent director, as appearing first on the slate. Any slate not complying with the foregoing shall be disregarded. In the number determined by Shareholders' Resolution, the Board of Directors shall be elected as follows: a. all the directors to be elected, except for one, arranged in the progressive order in which they are listed on the slate, shall be chosen from the slate that obtains the greatest number of the votes; and b. as listed first on the slate, the remaining director to be elected shall be taken from the slate that obtains the second greatest number of the votes.
Slates not attaining a percentage of votes equal to, or in excess of, the percentage of votes prescribed by the By-laws shall be disregarded.

On that occasion, the Company invited Shareholders who, alone or together, represented 4.5% or more of the share capital (as established by Consob Resolution 17148 issued on January 27, 2010), to deposit, at the Company's registered office, the candidature slates, along with the relevant documentation, at least fifteen days ahead of the date for the Meeting on the first call.

Policy on Maximum Number of Appointments in Other Companies The Board of Directors prefers not to express guidance on the maximum number of Directorship or Statutory Auditor appointments in other companies quoted on organized markets (whether in Italy or abroad), and in financial companies, banks, insurance companies or major corporations. The Board recognizes that exposure of its Directors or Statutory Auditors to other boards can broaden their experience and knowledge. Taking care to ensure that appointees have enough time to devote to the job, Directors and Statutory Auditors are therefore allowed to accept appointments subject to Board approval.
4.3. REMIT AND ROLE OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2d), of Italian Finance Act) The Board held six meetings in 2011, each one of which lasting two hours on average, to pass resolution on the quarterly financial reports, the half-yearly financial report, and the annual report and accounts and the motions to be submitted for approval at the Annual General Meeting 2011. As part of the business of each meeting of the Board, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of BasicItalia S.p.A. typically submits briefing papers (with effect from his appointment in July 2011) to assist in the understanding of legal, governance and regulatory developments as well as comments and feedback on the business to be discussed at the meeting and detailing progress against the goals the Board has approved. As a rule, the briefing papers containing supporting information relevant to the debate are delivered to Directors and Statutory Auditors in the days immediately preceding the meetings. In January 2012, the Company published the calendar setting out the dates set for the four Board meetings regarding the preparation of the draft financial statements and the approval of the consolidated financial statements for 2011 and for the approval of the results reported for the financial period. Without prejudice to the matters that cannot be delegated pursuant to Article 2381.4 of the Italian Civil Code, the Board of Directors: a. examines and approves the Company's strategic, operation and financial plans and the corporate structure of the Group it heads, and the system of corporate governance of Issuer and of the Group; b. evaluates the adequacy of the organizational, administrative and accounting structure of the Company and its subsidiaries, as established by the Managing Directors, with particular regard to the system of internal control and the management of conflicts of interest; c. delegates powers to the Managing Directors and revokes them; it specifies the limits on these delegated powers, the manner of exercising them and the frequency, as a rule no less than once every three months, with which the bodies in question must report to the Board on the activities performed in the exercise of the powers delegated to them, as set forth in Article 13 of the Bylaws; d. determines, after examining the proposal of the Remuneration Committee and consulting with the Board of Statutory Auditors, the remuneration of the Managing Directors and of those Directors who are appointed to particular positions within the Company and, if the Meeting of Shareholders has not already done so, determines the total amount to which the members of the Board are entitled; e. evaluates the general performance of the Company, paying particular attention to the information received from the delegated bodies, and periodically comparing the results achieved against plan; f. examines and approves in advance transactions carried out by the Company and its subsidiaries having a significant impact on the Company's profitability, assets and liabilities or financial position, paying particular attention to transactions on which one or more Directors hold an interest on their behalf or on behalf of third parties and, in more general terms, to transactions

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
involving related parties. Deemed to be strategic are all those transactions in respect of which no powers have been assigned to the Delegated Bodies; g. evaluates, at least once a year, the size, composition and performance of the Board of Directors and its Committees, eventually characterizing new professional figures whose presence on the Board would be considered appropriate; and h. draws up and adopts the Corporate Governance Report, providing therein information on the application thereof and, in particular, on the number of meetings of the Board and its Committees held during the fiscal year, as well as the related percentage of attendance of each director. And lastly, Article 16 of the By-laws attributes to the Board the authority to pass resolutions, pursuant to the requirements of law, with regard to mergers by incorporation or spin-offs, headquarter relocation across the homeland and the opening or closing of secondary offices, identifying which Directors are empowered to represent the Company in law, and amending the By-laws to reflect changes introduced by law. Additionally, within the limits established by Article 2410.1 of the Italian Civil Code, the Board of Directors is empowered to issue debentures. The Board of Directors, in coordination with the Internal Audit Committee, has assessed for adequacy the organizational, administrative and accounting structure of BasicNet S.p.A. and the organizational, administrative and accounting structure of its subsidiaries having strategic relevance, in particular with regard to their System of Internal Control and the management of conflicts of interest. Indeed, seamless continuity in the composition of the Boards of Directors of the Group companies facilitates those functions of control, timely knowledge and coordination of the instructions given to the subsidiaries. Also, as set forth in Article 13 of the By-laws, the Delegated Bodies report to the Board of Directors and to the Board of Statutory Auditors, no less than once every three months, on occasion of the Board Meetings, i.e. remit in writing addressed to the Board of Directors and to the Board of Statutory Auditors, reporting on operating and financial performance and business prospects and, not least, significant transactions, whether in terms of size or characteristics, put in place by the Company or its subsidiaries, with particular regard to the management of conflicts of interest or transactions subject to influence by the entity exercising management and control, on own behalf or on the behalf of others. In general, significant transactions, such as business acquisitions, disposals or divestments, new sponsorships, sureties, guarantees or derivative financial instrument hedges, are submitted to the Board of Directors. At the meeting held on February 10, 2012, the Board of Directors assessed the overall effectiveness of the Board against quantitative and qualitative performance targets as well as progress against the goals targeted in financial 20102011, taking into full account the attendance of all the Directors at the Board meetings and, not least, the tangible contribution made by individuals in Board debate. By way of attendant consequence, the Board is deemed to be appropriate, whether in terms of capability, membercount or remit, to provide entrepreneurial leadership in the pursuance of BasicNet S.p.A. and Group priorities, whilst maintaining and operating within a defined structure of prudent and effective controls. In harmonization with the CEO, the Chairman of the Board manages the Board agenda, taking into full account the information about the Company's performance, thus enabling the Board to take effective decisions and provide advice to support the efforts exerted by the Company. Also deemed to be balanced is the ratio of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. In 2011, average attendance by the Directors to the six Board meetings was 100%. At the Meeting held on April 30, 2010, resolution was passed, on Directorship appointment, not to impose on the Directors elected the non-competition clause pursuant to Article 2390 of the Italian Civil Code, insofar as the Directors are allowed to hold like-for-like appointments in Group companies.
However, all and any appointments that might be accepted by the Directors in competitor groups must be reported immediately to the Board.
4.4. DELEGATED BODIES At the Board meeting held on April 30, 2010, the Board of Directors assigned: - to the Chairman, Marco Daniele Boglione, all the powers of ordinary and extraordinary administration by single signature, within the limitation of Euro 3,000,000 with regard to purchasing and/or selling shares or share units in companies, businesses, business lines or trademarks, 5 million with regard to the yearly cost attaching to sponsorships, 75% of the Company's consolidated net

At the said Board meeting held on April 30, 2010, the Board of Directors also assigned to Board Director Paolo Cafasso, in his capacity of Group Financial Officer, the necessary powers in respect of the financial and administrative management of the Company.
Chairman of the Board of Directors At the Board meeting held on April 30, 2010, the Board of Directors recognized that the concentration of corporate offices in one single individual, i.e. the office of Chairman and Delegated Director in Mr. Marco Daniele Boglione, is justified by continuity and seamless Corporate Governance practice, insofar as he is the founder of the Group and has been involved, right from onset, in the activity pursued by the Company. As placed in evidence earlier, Mr. Marco Daniele Boglione holds an aggregate of 22,250,000 shares (or 36.479% of the share capital), of which 22,071,666 shares (or 36.187% the share capital), indirectly through BasicWorld S.r.l., held 90.58%, and, directly, 178,334 shares (or 0.29% of the share capital).
Executive Committee (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2d), of Italian Finance Act) No Executive Committee whatever has been set up within the Board of Directors.
Disclosures to the Board Details thereon can be found earlier in point 4.3.
4.5. OTHER EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Other than Chairman Marco Daniele Boglione, the Executive Directors are: Managing Director Franco Spalla; Group Financial Officer & Delegated Director Paolo Cafasso; Chief Operational Officer & Delegated Director Paola Bruschi and, with effect from 2H2011, Elisabetta Rolanda, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the strategic subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A.
4.6 INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS The Board of Directors comprises two Independent Directors: Giovanni Crespi and Adriano Marconetto. As so considered upon their appointment, the Board of Directors considered, during the Board meeting held on February 10, 2012, the independence of Board Director Giovanni Crespi and Board Director Adriano Marconetto, and whether there are any relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their independent judgment, as required by Consob Regulations and the Corporate Governance Code. The criteria and procedures adopted in assessing their independence have been verified by the Board of Statutory Auditors. For FY2011, the Board of Statutory Auditors has reported the outcome of those assessments in its remit to the Meeting of Shareholders. As a result of adopting the procedures regarding related party transactions pursuant to Consob Regulation 17221 issued on March 12, 2010, the Independent Directors of the Company are called to express an opinion on the substantial and procedural fairness in transactions with related parties.
4.7 LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR In relation to the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Code to appoint a lead independent director in the event that operational powers have been delegated to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors, at the meeting held on April 30, 2010, recognized in the light of the composition of the Board of Directors and, not least, the size and organizational structure of the Company, that such concentration of corporate offices does not compromise the impartiality and balance

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
required in the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors, retaining that in the case of eventual conflict of interest, Deputy Chairman Daniela Ovazza could temporarily replace the Chairman.
4.8 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SUCCESSION PLANNING At the time of writing, no succession planning has been put in place by the Company for the eventual replacement of the Executive Directors.
5. PROCESSING OF CORPORATE DISCLOSURES At the meeting held on May 15, 2002, the Board approved the Procedure for internal processing and external disclosure of confidential information, as subsequently reviewed and integrated following implementation of Market Abuse Regulations. This Procedure set outs the rules for establishing and managing, based on a specific computer-system process, the List of persons having access to inside or potential inside information. In compliance with Section 114 et seq. of the Italian Finance Act, a new Code of Conduct on Internal Dealing has been adopted with effect from April 1, 2006 for market disclosure on transactions involving BasicNet S.p.A. shares or other financial instruments linked to them by "Relevant Persons" of the Group. The Procedure can be found on the BasicNet website (www.basicnet.com). In 2011, sixteen transactions were reported to the market and relevant supervisory authorities.
6. COMMITTEES WITHIN THE BOARD (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2d), of Italian Finance Act) Other than those envisaged under the Italian Finance Act, the Company has neither set up committees within the Board nor united in one committee, and only one committee, the functions performed by two or more committees pursuant to the Italian Finance Act.
7. NOMINATION COMMITTEE As assessed and deemed to be appropriate in the past, the Board of Directors does not anticipate, by way of attendant consequence of the Company's size and shareholder structure, the need to set up, within the Board, a Nomination Committee, also in the light of the fact that Directors, as contemplated by Article 13 of the By-laws, are appointed on the basis of slates.
8. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE At the meeting held on April 30, 2010, the Board established the Remuneration Committee comprising Non-Executive Director Daniela Ovazza, Non-Executive Director Carlo Pavesio and Independent NonExecutive Director Adriano Marconetto. The Board retains that the Remuneration Committee, as formed in its actual composition of three NonExecutive Directors, one of whom being an Independent Director, carries out adequately its functions formulating proposals in line with Group goals and performance considering from time to time the commitment and performance delivered by the individual Delegated Directors. Committee recommendations have always received favorable opinions from the Board of Statutory Auditors. No Director participates in meetings of the Remuneration Committee in which proposals are submitted to the Board of Directors relating to his/her remuneration. In 2011, no recommendations were remitted to the Board of Directors by the Remuneration Committee. As a rule, minutes of the Remuneration Committee recommendations are taken and included in the minutes of the Board meetings at which these were submitted. The Remuneration Committee has the authority to access all and any information and/or business function in the pursuance of its duties.
9. REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS Further details and information about the matters discussed in this section can be found in the Remuneration Report published pursuant to Section 123-ter of the Italian Finance Act.
In a nutshell, the Group's structure does not envisage the presence of executive officers vested with strategic responsibilities who are not members of the Board of Directors of BasicNet S.p.A. or the Boards of Directors of its strategic subsidiaries.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The fees of the Directors are approved at the Meeting of Shareholders. The remuneration due to Directors vested with strategic responsibilities and the remuneration due to members of the Committees within the Board of Directors are determined by the Board of Directors, on remit by the Remuneration Committee, and having heard the opinion of the Statutory Auditors. The Board of Director may establish an additional fee or bonus identified by the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from the Remuneration Committee, on the achievement, beyond consensus expectation, of specific and significant targets.
Indemnity to Directors in the event of resignation or dismissal without just cause or if their employment should terminate as a result of a takeover bid (Section 123-bis, Subsection 1i), of Italian Finance Act) The information required under Section 123-bis, Subsection 1i), of the Italian Finance Code (Agreements between Company and Directors which envisage indemnities in the event of resignation or dismissal without just cause or if their employment contract should terminate as a result of a takeover bid) can be found in the Remuneration Report published pursuant to Section 123-ter of the Italian Finance Act on the Company's website at www.basicnet.com under "AGM 2012".
10. INTERNAL AUDIT COMMITTEE Composition and duties of the Internal Audit Committee (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2d), of Italian Finance Act) At the meeting held on April 30, 2010, the Board established the Internal Audit Committee, as formed in its actual composition. The Internal Audit Committee is composed of three Directors, one of whom being an Independent Director. The Board then decided that the Internal Audit Committee members should be adequately and appropriately skilled in financial and accounting matters. Accordingly, appointed as member of the Internal Audit Committee was an Executive Director, in the person of Director Paola Bruschi, who, as mentioned earlier, is an Executive and the Chief Operational Officer of the Company, so as to better flank the work performed by the other members, who are Independent and Non-Executive Director Giovanni Crespi and Non-Executive Director Alessandro Gabetti Davicini. With effect from July 2011, Director Giovanni Crespi forms part of the Board of Directors of the BasicItalia S.p.A. and is vested with responsibility for the Internal Audit of the Company. In 2011, the Internal Audit Committee met on two occasions and had regular access to the business data and information whenever requested, whether provided directly or password long-in and link into the Internal Audit section of the BasicNet website, and mainly examined: · the reports prepared by the Internal Auditing and/or Oversight Committee over the course of 2011; · the annual report on the adequacy of the System of Internal Control and the annual report on the accounting, administrative and organizational structure; · the implementation of new procedures; and · the observance of accounting and financial disclosures and compliance with new rules and regulations. Lasting about two hours each, the Internal Audit Committee meetings, at which minutes were taken, were attended by Paolo Cafasso, Group Financial Officer & Executive Officer responsible for the preparation of the accounting and financial statement documents, and, not least, by the Internal Auditing Chief Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors.
Tasks and duties of the Internal Audit Committee As part of its tasks and duties, the Internal Audit Committee must: a) assist the Board of Directors in discharging its duties relative to the System of Internal Control,
also in compliance with the Corporate Governance Code: (i) in the definition of guidelines for the System of Internal Control and with periodic audits of its
appropriate and effective functioning, in order to ensure that the main risks to which the Company and its subsidiaries are exposed are properly identified and, not least, adequately measured, managed and monitored, thereby helping to ensure that these are not exposed to excessive financial risk and that financial internal and external reporting is reliable, remitting thereon eventual recommendations to the Board of Directors; (ii) in the assessment, at least once a year, of the adequacy, effectiveness and efficient functioning of the System of Internal Control;
33

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(iii) in the description, presented within the Corporate Governance Report, of the essential elements of the System of Internal Control, formulating and expressing its own assessment as to the adequacy of the System of Internal Control as a whole;
b) assess, in cooperation with the Executive Officer responsible for the preparation of the accounting and financial statement documents and with the independent auditors, the adequacy of adopted accounting principles and their uniformity in view of preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other accounting documents;
c) assist at the request of the Executive Directors in identifying and assessing the greater exposure to risk and contribute to improvements in the risk identification, risk mitigation and risk management systems and, not least, to the design, realization and management of the System of Internal Control;
d) assess the audit plan prepared by the Internal Controller and receive his periodic reviews; e) perform any other task that may be assigned to it by the Board of Directors; and f) report to the Board of Directors on the adequacy of the System of Internal Control, once every six
months at least, at the time the Annual Report and the First-Half Report are approved. In the performance of its duties, the Committee may access the information and the necessary business functions, and may request the Board of Directors to take avail of independent expert advice.
11. SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL The System of Internal Control is an essential element of the corporate governance system. The System of Internal Control facilitates the effectiveness and efficiency of company operations and helps to ensure reliable financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations, other than contributing to the safeguarding of the Company's assets. The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the System of Internal Control, in respect of which the Board sets the guidelines and verifies periodically its adequacy and effectiveness to ensure that the main risks to which the Company and its subsidiaries are exposed are properly identified and managed. The Corporate Governance Code, the Code of Conduct for the Sourcing Centers, and the Best Practice Model of Organization, Management & Control required under Decree-Law 231/2001, as subsequently integrated and amended, form an integral part of the System of Internal Control. Although under continuous evolution and perfection, the code of conduct contained in the Control, Management & Organizational Model integrates and reinforces the systems of business control through the preparation and seamless update of the correlated procedures. Internal Auditing is tasked with assessing for overall adequacy, efficiency and effectiveness the System of Internal Control. In particular, given that certain functions are centralized with the parent company, Internal Auditing works toward assessing the regularity and functionality of the data streams to and from the subsidiaries having strategic relevance, as well as assessing for adequacy the computer-system platforms to ensure financial reporting of quality across the business. In terms of System of Internal Control assessments, based upon the fact that neither the Internal Audit members nor the Board of Statutory Auditors placed in evidence any material weakness in the System of Internal Control, particularly with regard to transactions in potential conflict of interest, the Board of Directors confirmed, at the meeting held on March 21, 20112012, that the System of Internal Control, although under continuous evolution and perfection, provides reasonable assurance about the Company's and the Group's financial control framework, compliance with laws, regulations and policies and risk management processes.
System of risk management and internal control over financial reporting (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2b), of Italian Finance Act). On enforcement of Decree-Law 262/2005 on the protection of savings, BasicNet put in place a project crafted around strengthening, where applicable, procedures and systems of internal control over financial reporting, defining the framework and frequency of internal financial controls, and attesting the adequacy of financial reporting. The Group's system of risk management and internal control over financial reporting (hereinafter the `System') is represented by a comprehensive set of rules and procedures adopted across all the "dot.com" entities to assure that reliable, accurate, complete and timely financial reporting is attained
34

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
through an effective `continuous assurance' process crafted around identifying, assessing and managing the main risks associated with the preparation and dissemination of financial information. Other than being designed to provide reasonable assurance that the annual and interim financial reports and accounts ­ separate or consolidated ­ made available to the general public agree with the underlying accounting records and give a true and fair view of the entity's state of affairs and financial condition, the System is designed to provide assurance as to the adequacy and effective application of the administrative and accounting procedures throughout the period to which the accounting documents (yearly, half-yearly and/or quarterly financial report and accounts) relate and that these have been prepared under IAS/IFRS. In defining the System, a risk assessment process was put in place to identify and assess events, known or unknown, that could affect adversely the achievement of financial reporting and financial control priorities. The risk assessment approach adopted enables focus on areas of higher risk and/or materiality, including those attributable to fraud. Risk identification and assessment was conducted at the inherent risk level, i.e. as though no controls were in place to eliminate, cut-out or mitigate the risk to an acceptable level. The risk identification and assessment process was developed with reference to both the company as a whole and at the process level. Once identified, the risks were assessed, taking into account both the qualitative and quantitative aspects for the second type of risk. Once assessed, specific controls were identified and designed to reduce to an acceptable level the risk arising from non-achievement of the System's objectives, whether at the Company or process level. The System provides for:  a set of rules and procedures to be followed in preparing the financial statements and the monthly
financial reports, and accounting calendars designed to provide an effective exchange of data between the parent company and its subsidiaries;  a process designed to identify and assess the main risks of error in accounting and financial reporting, pegged to a web-implemented control process having the capability to pinpoint mismatching; and  a process built around assessing periodically the adequacy and effective application of controls, the latter monitored directly by the Internal Control Officer. Based on the Best Practice Model of Organization, Management and Control required under DecreeLaw 231/2001, the prevention and control activity encompasses controls linked to the assignment of responsibilities, powers and delegations, whether by separating tasks and duties or assigning diverse access rights to IT and computer-system applications, releasing authorizations, making reconciliations and verifying consistency.
11.1. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL The Internal Audit Committee is assisted in its activity by Executive Director Paolo Cafasso, who, insofar as responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and, not least, in his capacity of Group Financial Officer, oversees the effectiveness of the Group's System of Internal Control. In the performance of that role, he oversees the functionality of the System of Internal Control, steering a keen eye toward identifying the main business risks (operational, financial and compliance), giving substance and form to the guidelines outlined by the Board, looking after the planning, realization and management of the System of Internal Control, and verifying, on a continuing basis, the related overall adequacy, effectiveness and efficiency thereof, also with reference to the evolution followed by operating conditions and by the legislative and regulatory landscape.
11.2 INTERNAL AUDITING Internal Auditing is tasked with assessing for overall adequacy, efficiency and effectiveness the System of Internal Control. In particular, given that certain functions are centralized with the parent company, Internal Auditing works toward assessing the regularity and functionality of the data streams to and from the subsidiaries having strategic relevance, as well as assessing for adequacy the computer-system platforms to ensure financial reporting of quality across the business. The Internal Auditing function forms part of the System of Internal Audit. On appointment, the Board also defined a fee for the Internal Auditing function, as deemed to be appropriate to the Group's structure. The Internal Auditing function, which is not responsible for any operational area, has direct access to all and any information that may be deemed to be useful in the pursuance of its task. The Internal Auditing

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
remit is delivered to the Internal Audit Committee, the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Internal Audit Executive Director. The activity of control consists primarily in monitoring the key performance indicators of certain Group companies, as accomplished using the on-line reporting tool (Tableau de Bord) extant in the BasicNet portal. Such reporting represents an important tool in real-time monitoring of book assets and business trending and performance: the data are made available by individual Group company and are analyzable by individual balance sheet and income statement item. Taken as a whole, the Internal Auditing function has been assigned to an unrelated firm outside the Group. The function has been outsourced in that unrelated firm, which already cooperated in the same manner with the Group, insofar as deemed to have the qualifications necessary to carry out efficiently and effectively that role within the Group, on an independent and expert basis.
11.3 BEST PRACTICE MODEL PURSUANT TO DECREE-LAW 231/2001 The Corporate Governance Code, the Code of Conduct for the Sourcing Centers, and the Best Practice Model of Organization, Management & Control required under Decree-Law 231/2001, as subsequently integrated and amended, form part of the System of Internal Control. The code of conduct set forth in the Best Practice Model, in continuous evolution, integrates and strengthens the business systems through the drafting and updating of the correlated procedures on a continuing basis. To render the Corporate Governance Code, the Code of Ethics and the Best Practice Model more effective, these are made available on the BasicNet website (www.basicnet.com) and on the clock-in detection system reserved for Group employees. The Corporate Governance Code and the Code of Ethics are presented in the form of a video to all new hires of the Group and disseminated to all consultant team members. The Board of Directors has nominated an Oversight Committee (OC), tasking the OC with overseeing the Best Practice Model to ensure that it is operating effectively and to identify and implement any updates required. The Oversight Committee's remit to the Internal Control Committee and to the Board of Statutory Auditors is six-monthly.
11.4 AUDIT FIRM The accounts are audited by a legally registered auditing firm. The Annual General Meeting held on April 30, 2008 assigned the audit engagement to PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A. The audit engagement reaches expiration date on approval of the annual accounts for the year ended December 31, 2016.
11.5 OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At the meeting held on April 30, 2010, the Company's Board of Directors appointed, having received a favorable opinion from the Board of Statutory Auditors, Group Financial Officer & Board Director Paolo Cafasso as the Officer responsible for the preparation of the Company's financial statements. As well as satisfying the requirements of integrity prescribed by law for Directorships, Paolo Cafasso boasts multi-year expertise in the field of administration, finance and control. In the pursuance of his duties, Paolo Cafasso has the authority to approve the business procedures having an impact on the separate financial statements, and/or on the consolidated financial statements and on the other documents subject to attest, with the right to partake in the planning of IT and computer-system platforms having an impact on the entity's operations and financial condition; in addition thereto, he may organize an adequate structure appropriate to his assignment, taking avail of the internal resources available or, where applicable, reverting to outsourcing; as may be deemed to be necessary, he may assume financial and other commitments in respect of the company, issuing adequate remit to the Board of Directors; he may use the Internal Auditing function for internal auditing analysis and mapping purposes in the performance of specific controls.
12. DIRECTOR INTERESTS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES The Board of Directors, having received a favorable opinion from the Independent Directors, adopted the Procedures for Transactions with Related Parties, which comply with Consob Regulation 17221 issued on March 12, 2010.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
entrusted to the Board of Directors, or, within the limits of the delegations assigned thereto, the Delegated Bodies, provided that these are not a related party in the transaction, and shall be subject to prior and non-binding reasoned opinion of the Independent Directors or Other Board Committees of the Board of Directors. Should the Independent Directors or other Board Committees of the Board of Directors express a dissenting opinion on a transaction falling within the powers attributed to the Delegated Bodies, this shall be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. Should the transaction surpass the limit of the delegations assigned to the Delegated Bodies, this shall be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval, and shall be subject to prior and non-binding reasoned opinion of the Independent Directors or Other Board Committees of the Board of Directors. To all intents and purposes, however, reserved to the Board of Directors are resolutions in respect of transactions intended to be carried out at conditions not defined as market-equivalent or standard, as well as transactions of greater significance as defined in the Consob Regulation. Other than all the instances explicitly envisaged by the Related Party Regulation issued by Consob, also exempted from the Procedure, as regards the aspects of approval, are transactions individually not significant (transactions having a value of Euro 150 thousand or less), and transactions put in place at standard or fair value based on market conditions in the ordinary course of the Company's operating activities or any financial activity that is directly connected to those operating activities; transactions entered into with or between subsidiaries, whether jointly or otherwise, by BasicNet provided that other related parties do not hold significant interests in the BasicNet subsidiary participating in the transaction. For the purpose of applying this exemption, the mere sharing between BasicNet and the subsidiaries it controls of one or more Directors or one or more executives with strategic responsibilities is not deemed to represent a significant interest. Using the "basicprocurement" web function, a procedure has been implemented whereby an Alert Mail is transmitted whenever an order to a related party, as identified on the basis of the communications received from related parties (members of the Board of Directors or members of the Board of Statutory Auditors) is uploaded. In 2011, no related party transactions significant in amount have been submitted to the Board of Directors. The Procedure can be found on the BasicNet website at www.basicnet.com under "Corporate Governance".
13. STATUTORY AUDITOR APPOINTMENTS As established by Article 17 of the Company's By-laws, the Board of Statutory Auditors is composed of three Standing Auditors. In addition thereto, two Alternate Auditors shall be appointed. As identified by currently prevailing laws and regulations, one Standing Auditor and one Alternate Auditor shall be elected by the minority shareholders. The Board of Statutory Auditors shall be appointed on the basis of slates submitted by the Shareholders, where the candidates are listed in progressive order. The slate is divided into two sections: one for the standing auditor candidates and the other for the alternate auditor candidates. Having the right to submit slates shall be those Shareholders, and only those Shareholders, who, alone or together with other Shareholders, hold a total number of shares having such voting rights as to represent the percentage of the Company's capital required by law at such time. The proposed candidacies shall be filed at the Company's registered office no later than fifteen days before the Meeting of Shareholders, along with: information about the identity of those presenting the slates; statement of attest that no connection exists between the controlling shareholder and the relative shareholders and group companies pertaining thereto; professional curriculum vitae of the individual candidates; evidence of administration and control appointments held in other companies; statement of attest that there are no grounds for ineligibility or conflicts of interest or forfeiture, and that the candidates meet the requirements of independence prescribed by applicable laws and regulations and by the By-laws; acceptance of the appointment. In connection thereto, as envisaged by the Ministerial Decree (Ministry of Justice and Grace) taking effect on March 30, 2000, the By-laws specify the professional requisites required to serve as statutory auditor of the Company. To all intents and purposes, not eligible for election are candidates not meeting the requisites of independence, integrity and professionalism prescribed by applicable legal and
37

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
regulatory requirements and by the By-laws, or candidates already holding the maximum number of statutory auditor or director appointments, as such number is defined by applicable law. The members of the Board of Statutory Auditors are elected as follows:  as arranged in the progressive order in which they are listed on the slate, the two standing auditors
and one alternate auditor to be elected shall be chosen from the slate that obtains the greatest number of votes;  as arranged in the progressive order in which they are listed on the slate, the remaining standing auditor and the remaining alternate auditor to be elected shall be taken from the second slate that obtains the greatest number of votes. The Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors shall be deemed to be the first candidate listed on the second slate that obtains the greatest number of votes. In the case of a tie, the candidates listed on the slate submitted by the majority shareholders, i.e. the candidates listed on the slate that was submitted by the greatest number of shareholders. Should one, and only one, slate of candidates be submitted, all the Standing Auditors and all the Alternate Auditors shall be elected from that slate, and the candidate first listed on such slate shall be elected Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors.
14. STATUTORY AUDITORS (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2d), of Italian Finance Act) As currently in office, the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors, i.e. Standing Auditor Massimo Boidi, Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors, and Standing Auditor Carola Alberti and Standing Auditor Maurizio Ferrero, were appointed at the Meeting of Shareholders held on April 30, 2010 on the basis of the one, and only one, slate presented by, and deposited by the shareholder BasicWorld S.r.l., the titleholder, at the date thereof, to 35.792% of the share capital, inasmuch as no other slate was presented within the legally required timescale applicable to titleholders entitled to 2.5% or more of the shares having voting rights. The documentation filed for the purpose of the statutory auditor appointments, including therein the professional curriculum vitae thereof, may be accessed through the BasicNet website at www.basicnet.com. The term of office of the Board of Statutory Auditors reaches expiration date at the date on which the Annual General Meeting approves the separate financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012. In terms of its composition, the Board of Statutory Auditors is in line with the "gender quota" requirement recently introduced by Consob. Other than satisfying the requirements of integrity, professional qualification and independence prescribed by law and required by the Company's By-laws, each member of the Board of Statutory Auditors satisfies the requirements of independence prescribed by the Corporate Governance Code. The Board of Statutory Auditors has verified that each of its members satisfy the requirements of independence prescribed by the Code on Corporate Governance issued in March 2006, confirming that the statutory auditors currently in office, albeit holding office since nine years or more, satisfy substantially the requisites for being considered independent, as prescribed by the Code on Corporate Governance referred to above. In 2011, the Board of Statutory Auditors held four meetings. Should a Statutory Auditor, on own behalf or on the behalf of others, have an interest in any one transaction of the Issuer, he/she shall promptly inform on a detailed basis the other statutory auditors and the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors about the nature, term, origin and extent of his or her interest. This, moreover, has never occurred. The Board of Statutory Auditors oversees the independence of the independent auditors, verifying both observance of the relevant laws and regulations, and the nature and entity of the services, other than auditing services, provided to Issuer and its subsidiaries by the same independent auditing firm and/or by its associate firms. As placed in evidence earlier, the Board of Statutory Auditors coordinates, in the pursuance of its activity, with the Internal Auditing function and with the Internal Audit Committee.
15. INVESTOR RELATIONS The Chairman and the Managing Director also identified, among the other things, the Investor Relator, and have established and maintain an ongoing dialogue with individual shareholders and institutional investors.
38

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Also, right from floating and listing, the Company has sought to enhance ongoing dialogue with shareholders and institutional investors using its website (www.basicnet.com). The website is used to publish operating and financial information (financial statements, quarterly and six-monthly reports, presentations to the financial community, and share price performance), and information and document updates of interest to shareholders (members of the Board of Directors; members of the Board of Statutory Auditors; Independent Auditors; By-laws and Shareholders' Meeting Regulations; Report on Corporate Governance; Code of Ethics; Group organizational framework and Group operations), as well as the reports prepared for presentation at Meetings of Shareholders. Also published on the website are press releases concerning the Brands or the Group companies and, not least, concerning Chairman Marco Daniele Boglione or Managing Director Franco Spalla.
16. MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2c), of Italian Finance Act) Meetings of Shareholders provided regular opportunities to meet and communicate with Shareholders. During the Meetings, the Chairman and the Managing Director always encourage the active involvement of the Shareholders, making available all the information necessary or deemed to be useful so that they are in a position to consider and, if thought fit, pass resolutions. General Meetings of Shareholders exercise the functions contemplated under Article 2364 of the Italian Civil Code. Extraordinary Meetings of Shareholders exercise the functions contemplated under Article 2365 of the Italian Civil Code. In order to ensure that Meetings are conducted in an orderly and functional manner and, moreover, to guarantee the rights of each shareholder to take the floor and debate upon the items of business on the agenda, the Meeting of Shareholders (on June 30, 2000 and, subsequently, with additions and/or amendments, on April 30, 2011) passed resolution approving the BasicNet Shareholders' Meeting Regulations The BasicNet Shareholders' Meeting Regulations may be accessed on the Company's website at www.basicnet.com. As a rule, the Meetings are attended by all the Directors. The Issuer's shareholder structure as at December 31, 2011 is substantially unchanged from the year before.
17. OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES (Section 123-bis, Subsection 2a) of Italian Finance Act) Other than those disclosed hereinabove, no other corporate governance practices effectively applicable to the Issuer are mandatory under prevailing legal and regulatory provisions of law.
18. CHANGES FROM FINANCIAL YEAR-END OF REFERENCE On a basis consistent with the amendments to the Recommendations regarding the remuneration of directors and executives vested with strategic responsibilities, approved by the Corporate Governance Committee in March 2011 and the amendments to the Regulation for Issuers regarding transparent remuneration introduced by Resolution 180489 effective from December 31, 2011, the Board of Directors approved, at the Board meeting held on February 20, 2012, the Group's Overall Remuneration Policy. The Board of Directors will propose at the forthcoming Extraordinary AGM, called to meet on April 27, 2012, a motion to amend Article 13 (Board of Directors, Board Committees and Delegated Officers) and Article 17 (Board of Statutory Auditors) of the BasicNet By-laws, in response to a mandatory `gender quota' legal and regulatory requirement.
By Order of the Board of Directors
Marco Daniele Boglione

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS BasicNet S.p.A - with registered office in Turin, and listed on the Italian Stock Exchange with effect from November 17, 1999 - and its Subsidiaries are major players in the sector of branded casual and leisurewear, sportswear, footwear and accessories marketed under the Kappa, Robe di Kappa, Jesus Jeans, Lanzera, K-Way, Superga, AnziBesson and Sabelt brand identities. The activity pursued by the Group unfolds into enhancing the value of the brands and broadening the market reach of the related branded products resulting therefrom through a global network of independent licensees. The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2011 were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors of BasicNet S.p.A. on March 21, 2012.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
Set forth below are the more significant accounting policies and measurement bases adopted in preparing the consolidated financial statements and Group aggregate financial data.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the fair value measurement of certain financial instruments.
The consolidated financial statements for 2011 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (the `IFRSs') issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as endorsed for use in the European Union. The designation `IFRS' also includes all International Accounting Standards (IASs), whether revised or otherwise, and all the Interpretations pronounced by the International Financing Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), previously known as the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).
The consolidated financial statements incorporate as at December 31, 2011 the accounts of BasicNet S.p.A. and the accounts of all the Italian and foreign companies in which the parent company holds, directly or indirectly, the majority of the voting rights. Insofar as preparing their individual financial statements under local GAAP, the accounting policies of the U.S., Spanish and Dutch subsidiaries do not conform with adopted IAS/IFRS. Therefore, where appropriate, adjustments are made in order to present the Group Financial Statements on a consistent basis.
The accounting policies and measurement bases adopted in preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2011 are unchanged from the previous year.
New Accounting Standards
Accounting Standards, Amendments and Interpretations effective from January 1, 2011 but not applicable to the Group:
 Amendment to IAS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation: Classification of Rights Issues denominated in Foreign Currency
 Amendment to IAS 24 - Related Party Disclosures. The amendment simplifies the type of disclosures required in the instance of State-owned related parties and clarifies the definition of related parties.
 Amendment to IFRS 1 - First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendment consents simplifications to first-time adopters and provides guidance to entities in respect of changes in accounting policies in their first IFRS financial statements.

New Standards and Amendments issued by the IASB and not early adopted by the Group: - IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements replacing SIC 12 ­ Consolidation: Special Purpose
Entities and parts of IAS 27 ­ Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The new standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as determining factor in whether an entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company and provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IFRS 11 - Joint Arrangement superseding IAS 31 ­ Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC 13- JointlyControlled Entities ­ Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers. The new standard provides the criteria for making a distinction between joint arrangements and joint-venture arrangements. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. A new and comprehensive standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates, special purpose entities and other unconsolidated entities. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement. The new standard clarifies the determination of the fair value for the purpose of the financial statements and applies to all IFRSs permitting or requiring a fair value measurement or the presentation of disclosures based on fair value. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IAS 27 - Separate Financial Statements. As a result of the amended version of IFRS 10 being issued, the sphere of application of IAS 27 is confined to the separate financial statements, and only to the separate financial statements. Eliminated therefore from IAS 27 are all and any reference to the consolidated financial statements. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IAS 28 - Investments in Associates and Interests in Joint Ventures. The new standard sets out the accounting treatment for investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, as well the criteria in respect of the application of the equity method, and has been amended as a result of the amended versions of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 being issued. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IAS 19 - Employee Benefits. The amended version of IAS 19 eliminates the option to defer the recognition of gains and losses, known as the "corridor method", and introduces improvements to the disclosure to be provided in respect of defined benefit plans. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1 2013, with early adoption being permitted.

3. FORMAT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BasicNet Group presents an income statement in which expenses are classified by nature, whilst current and non-current assets, and current and non-current liabilities, are presented as separate classifications in its statement of financial position (consolidated balance sheet). The consolidated statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method. Taken into account when preparing the consolidated financial statements were the requirements of Consob Resolution 15519 of July 27, 2006 (format of the financial statements) and Consob Resolution 6064293 of July 28, 2006 (disclosures). In connection thereto, information about items of income or expense resulting from related party transactions can be found, insofar as not meaningful when taken as a whole, in Note 43 to the consolidated financial statements, as provided for by Consob Resolution 15519 issued on July 27, 2006.
4. CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES
The financial statements used in the consolidation are those prepared at December 31, 2011 by the BasicNet companies included in the consolidation, as adjusted, where applicable, to conform with Group accounting policies.
The consolidated financial statements of the BasicNet Group are presented in Euro, which is the functional currency for the economies in which the Group primarily operates.
On consolidation, the income statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euro using the relevant average exchange rate or the rate of exchange applying at the date of the original transaction in the instance of non-recurring transactions. The statements of financial position of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euro at the relevant rates of exchange prevailing at the year-end. Exchange differences resulting from translation of opening equity at year-end rates of exchange are recognized as currency translation differences within other comprehensive income.
Set forth below are the rates of exchange applied:

Foreign exchange
U.S. dollar HK dollar

FY2011

Average

Year-end

0.7153 0.0919

0.7729 0.0995

FY2010

Average

Year-end

0.7585 0.0976

0.7484 0.0963

The consolidation principles applied are as follows:
a) in preparing the consolidated accounts, the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses, regardless of the percentage of ownership. The carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary and the parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary are eliminated. Insofar as all the entities included in the scope of consolidation are held wholly, no minority interests in the net assets and net income of the Group and no minority assets in the net assets and net income of consolidated companies have been attributed;
b) positive differences arising on elimination of the investment against the fair value of the related shareholders' equity of the subsidiaries at the date of acquisition are allocated, where applicable, to the assets and liabilities of the company being consolidated. The residual value, if any, is treated as goodwill. On IFRS First-time Adoption, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to the business combinations that occurred before January 1, 2004;

50

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
c) intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses, including profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognized in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full as are unrealized profits and losses resulting from intragroup mergers or intragroup business line disposals.
Joint ventures are included in the consolidation on a proportionate basis.
As reported in Exhibit 2, the Group is constituted exclusively at December 31, 2011 by subsidiary undertakings held directly or indirectly by BasicNet S.p.A., the parent company; not forming part of the Group are associates.
Control is regarded as the power to govern, directly or indirectly, the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or presently convertible are considered when assessing whether an enterprise controls or significantly influences another enterprise. Subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidation as from the date on which control initiates up to the date on which control ceases.
Associates, on the other hand, are enterprises over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies, as defined by IAS 28 Investments in Associates. Investments in associates are initially recorded at cost and, after initial recognition, are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the Group's share of the profits or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition. The income statement reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the investee.
A joint venture is a contractual arranged whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. The entities subject to joint control are included in the consolidation on a proportionate basis.
Scope of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BasicNet S.p.A., the parent company, and the accounts of all the Italian and foreign subsidiaries over which BasicNet S.p.A. exercises, directly or indirectly, control. With effect from October 3, 2011, included within the scope of consolidation is Fashion S.p.A., in which BasicNet S.p.A. holds a 50% interest and over which joint control is exercised. As in the year before, not included line-by-line in the consolidation are the accounts of the subsidiary Jesus Jeans S.r.l., insofar as re-entering into operation part way December 2011, also not included lineby-line in the consolidation are the accounts of alloSpaccio S.r.l., insofar as not yet operational.
Set out as an attachment hereto, is the list of BasicNet Group companies, along with details of their business names, registered office, declared strategic intent, share capital and percentage of direct and indirect ownership.
Disclosures by operating segment and geographic area
Identified at the primary level within the BasicNet Group are three operating segments: i) trademark license management; ii) wholesale and retail sales, put in place through proprietary licensee, and; iii) property operational management. The breakdown of licensee aggregate sales by geographic area can be found in Note 7.
Segmental disclosure by geographic area is relevant for assessing the royalty income and net sales of the Group and, as such, is presented in the Notes relating to the relevant two consolidated income statement accounts, i.e. royalty income and net sales. The breakdown of licensee aggregate sales by geographic area from which the royalties arise can be found in the Management Report.

5. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements for 2011 have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting. The currency unit adopted is the Euro and all the amounts are rounded to thousands of Euro.
Set forth below are the more significant accounting policies and measurement bases adopted in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011:
Revenue Recognition
Revenue stems from Group operations in the ordinary course of business and comprises revenue from sales and services. Revenue is recognized net of value added tax, product returns and trade discounts.
Revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. More pointedly, revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the enterprise has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, and the selling price has been agreed or determined and the collection of revenues is assured. In other words, revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the moment that legal title passes, which generally coincides with shipping or consignment. As permitted under IAS 18, revenues from goods sold to Group trademark stores operated and managed by unrelated parties (franchised stores), in respect of which a right of return has been negotiated by contract, are recognized when the right of return expires which is generally on ultimate sale of the goods to end-customer. Revenue from royalties or from sourcing commission is recognized on an accrual basis in agreement with the substance of the underlying contracts.
Cost/Expense Recognition
Costs and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting.
Costs associated with sponsorship contracts paid each period are matched on an accrual basis to the respective contract.
Costs relating to the preparation and presentation of sample collections are dealt with through the income statement in the period in which the relevant sample collection sales are collected. Deferral, if any, is recognized through deferred expenses.
Costs relating to advertising campaigns designed specifically toward compounding orders taken by the salesforce are expensed directly, in accordance with IAS/IFRS, over the period in which the campaign is performed, rather than being correlated to the related revenues, which will crystallize only successively, once the orders taken are cleared, insofar as this second methodology better portrays consistency with the advertising campaigns.
Interest Income and Interest Expense, and Income and Expenses
Interest income and interest expense, and other income and expenses, are recognized and stated in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting.
Translation Criteria for Balances Denominated in Foreign Currency
Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency are converted into Euro at the respective rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the original transaction. The exchange differences realized on the collection of receivables or payment of liabilities are dealt with through the income statement.
52

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Income and revenue, and costs and expenses relating to transactions denominated in foreign currency are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the original transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency at the end of the reporting period are reported at the forward contract rate prevailing at that date, and the related foreign exchange gains or losses are dealt with through the income statement.
Income Taxes
Current income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group. Taxes on income are recognized in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items directly charged or credited to equity, in which case the related income tax effect is recognized directly in equity.
Deferred taxes are calculated on all the temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses and tax credits, as well as those arising from temporary differences, are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the substantively enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which the Group operates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which temporary differences will be reversed. Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right of offset.
The parent company has adhered to the National Tax Consolidation program pursuant to Section 177 et seq. of the Italian Tax Code (Presidential Decree (DPR) 917 of December 22, 1986) along with the Italian subsidiaries BasicItalia S.p.A., Basic Village S.p.A. and Rdk0 S.r.l. for the three-year period 2009, 2010 and 2011, and, with effect from FY2010, with the Italian subsidiaries BasicOutlet S.r.l. and BasicCRS S.r.l. Each company adhering to National tax consolidation transfers its taxable income or tax loss to BasicNet S.p.A., the tax consolidating entity. BasicNet S.p.A. recognizes receivables from companies contributing taxable incomes, corresponding to the amount of `Ires' corporate income tax paid on its behalf. Conversely, whenever a company brings a tax loss into the national tax consolidation, BasicNet S.p.A. recognizes a payable to that company for the amount of the loss effectively set off at the Group level. The Italian branches of certain foreign investees, albeit producing taxable profits in Italy, may not be included in the national tax consolidation.
BasicNet S.p.A. acts as the tax consolidating entity in this program and determines a single taxable base for the grouping of companies taking part, thereby enabling benefits to be realized from the offsetting of taxable income and tax losses in a single tax return. Each company adhering to national tax consolidation transfers its taxable income or tax loss to the tax consolidating entity. BasicNet S.p.A. recognizes receivables from companies contributing taxable incomes, corresponding to the amount of `Ires' corporate income tax paid on its behalf. Conversely, whenever a company brings a tax loss into the national tax consolidation, BasicNet S.p.A. recognizes a payable to that company for the amount of the loss effectively set off at the Group level.
Other taxes not based on income, such as property tax and capital tax, are included in operating expenses.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the period attributable to owners of the Parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the Parent by the diluted weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period.
Over the last twelve months, there were no Ordinary Shares in issue for diluted earnings.
53

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Contingent Liabilities
Through the normal course of business, BasicNet may be involved in tax and legal disputes covering a range of matters in various jurisdictions, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Group. Due to the uncertainty attaching thereto, it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters. Furthermore, the Group is party to legal disputes defending its premium brands and/or products from imitation and falsification. The cases and claims against the Group frequently raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to a broad spectrum of uncertainties and complexities, including but not limited to the facts and circumstances relative to each particular case and claim, the jurisdiction and differences in applicable law.
In the normal course of business, Management consults with legal counsel and advisors on litigation and tax matters. Provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs, including related legal costs, can be estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate disclosures are included in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Group Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used to measure the intangible assets and the items of property, plant and equipment tested for impairment as discussed further ahead and, not least, to report allowances for doubtful accounts, obsolete inventories, depreciation and amortization, assets written down, employee benefits, taxation, other provisions and reserves.
The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of all changes are reflected immediately in the income statement.
Intangible Assets
An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, that meets the meets the recognition criteria (identifiabiility, control over a resource, and evidence of future economics benefits that will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably). An intangible asset with finite useful life is recognized at purchase price or production cost, including any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use, less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization begins when the asset is available for use and is charged on a systematic basis over the asset's useful life.
Software Purchased software and internally generated computer-system programs are amortized over five years. Software costs incurred in maintaining or restoring the originally assessed standard of performance are recognized as an expense as and when incurred, and are not capitalized.
Development Costs Development costs capitalized when it can be demonstrated that the development expenditure will generate probable future economic benefits and the other conditions required by IAS 38 are satisfied.
Trademarks and Patents Given the bolder reach carved out around the globe by the Kappa, Robe di Kappa, Superga and K-Way "power brands" and the resultant royalty stream iconic status earned and, not least, given that no deterrents were believed to exist that would limit the generation of cash flows over the longer horizon, the
54

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Directors of the BasicNet Group reassessed in 4Q2010 the estimated useful economic lives of those brands, in application of International Accounting Standard IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, suspending on a forward-looking basis the related amortization thereof, all of which without prejudice to impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in the circumstances indicate a possible decline in the carrying amount.
Insofar as having still to reach the iconic status spiked by the "power brands", the Lanzera, Jesus, AnziBesson and Sabelt brands continue to be measured at the cost of purchase and are amortized over a period of twenty years.
Patent rights are amortized over a period of ten years.
Other Intangible Assets If the cost (i.e. fair value) of an intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination that is an acquisition can be measured reliably, that asset is recognized as a separate intangible asset and not classified under goodwill.
Goodwill
In the instance of a business combination that is an acquisition, the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. The positive difference between the cost of the business combination over the Group's share of the fair values of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is classified as goodwill and included in the accounts under intangible assets. Conversely, any negative difference ("negative goodwill") is recognized immediately in the income statement.
Insofar as not amortized, goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. After initial recognition, goodwill is carried at its cost less any cumulative impairment losses.
Also encompassed within this class of assets are amounts paid by the Group in taking over contractual positions relating to sales outlets, whether operated and managed directly or franchised. Such items of commercial goodwill included in the consolidated accounts are deemed to be intangible assets with an indefinite life and, as such, are not amortized. Irrespective of whether there is any indication that it may be impaired, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually by comparing its carrying amount to its recoverable amount as resulting from estimated value in use or expert appraisal reports. The recoverable amount is the greater of an asset's value in use and its fair value less to sell. Conversely, the goodwill recognized in relation to business line contract awards is amortized over the underlying contract term.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are tangible fixed assets, and are stated at purchase price or production cost. Cost includes accessory expenses, as well as the portion of direct and indirect costs which can be reasonably attributed to the assets .
Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment that has already been recognized is added to the carrying amount of the asset if, and only if, the future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset, will flow to the entity. All other subsequent expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of the assets on a straight-line basis over their useful life expectancy, as follows:

PPE Buildings

Useful life expectancy (in years)
33

Plant and machinery

8

Furniture, fittings and fixtures

5 to 8

Motor vehicles

4

Electronic and electric machinery

5 to 8

The assets are written down to reflect any impairment, other than temporary, in value at the end of the reporting period. If, in subsequent periods, the reasons for the write-down cease to apply, the original value is reinstated.
Ordinary maintenance costs are charged wholly against the consolidated income statement.
Payments on account and assets under construction, as yet not entered into service at the end of the reporting period, are shown separately.
Land, as duly appraised by independent expert valuers, has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.
Assets held under lease
Land and buildings held under finance lease are accounted for under the finance method. The asset is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset, and is depreciated over its estimated useful life.
The depreciation provided on the assets is reflected in the annual consolidated financial statements in the same way as other items of property, plant and equipment.
The obligation related to finance leases, net of financial charges, in respect of future periods, are included, as appropriate, under current liabilities or non-current liabilities. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance on the obligation for each accounting period.
Impairment of Assets
The carrying amount of the assets held by the Group are tested for impairment at the end of each reporting period to assess whether there is any indication of impairment other than temporary, in which case the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. If this is the case, the impairment loss is assessed and recognized as an expense in the income statement when the carrying amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is greater than the recoverable amount of the asset to which it relates. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including therein goodwill, are assessed annually, or whenever any indication of impairment losses is identified.

56

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Measuring Recoverable Amount
The recoverable amount of an asset other than a financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In measuring value in use, the estimated future cash flows are actualized applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets. Should an asset not generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of those from other assets, value in use and, therefore, recoverable amount, can be determined only for the asset's cash-generating unit.
Reversing an Impairment Loss
An impairment loss recognized for an asset other than goodwill in prior years is reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is recognized as income immediately in the income statement, adjusting the carrying amount of the asset to its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset other than goodwill is not increased above the lower of the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortization or depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.
Investments and Other Financial Assets
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, The differences between the cost of the investment over the investor's share of the fair values of the net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition is treated on a basis consistent with the consolidation principles discussed.
Investments in other enterprises are carried at cost, as written down to reflect any impairment, other than temporary, in value, should the related fair value thereof not be reliably determinable, insofar as relating to entities not quoted. If, in subsequent periods, the reasons for the write-down cease to apply, the original value is reinstated.
Receivables classified under financial fixed assets are stated at their presumed realizable value.
Inventories
Inventories are measured under the weighted average cost method of valuation.
Inventories are stated at the lower of production or purchase price or net realizable value based on market conditions.
The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs directly and indirectly attributable to bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Inventory writedowns are written back in subsequent periods if the reasons for the write-down cease to apply. Obsolete and slow-moving inventories are written down on the basis of their possible utilization or saleability.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at nominal value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method if long-term in nature, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Receivables sold without recourse, for which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to assignee, are derecognized at their nominal value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. These are stated in the amounts effectively available at the end of the reporting period.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
Accruals and Prepayments
Accruals and prepayments include the portion of revenues and expenses covering two or more periods, in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting.
Treasury Shares
Treasury shares are presented as a deduction from equity. The original cost of treasury shares and the proceeds of any subsequent sale are presented as movements in equity.
Reserves for Risks and Charges
Provisions for risks and charges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet if, and only if, there is an implicit or legal obligation that should result in an out flow from the enterprise of resources embodying economic benefits, and a reliable estimation thereof can be determined.
Employee Benefits
Employee benefits that fall within the scope of Italy's TFR (provision for severance pay) are considered defined post-employment benefits and are therefore measured on an accrual basis using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
With effect from January 1, 2007, such liability relates exclusively to the TFR allocations accrued up to December 31, 2006, which, by virtue of the pension reform (establishment of a supplementary pension fund) introduced by the government (Italian legislative decree no. 252 of December 5, 2005), continues to represent an obligation for the entity. As a result of such reform being incorporated into Italian law by virtue of Law No. 296 of December 27, 2006 (Italian Financial Act 2007), the liability, insofar as relating to past service costs, has been remeasured without applying the pro-rated service worked and without reflecting, in the actuarial computation, the material element of estimated future salary increases.
The TFR allocations paid into supplementary pension funds represent a form of deferred contribution plan under which the entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Additionally, the TFR allocations transferred to the special TFR fund managed by the National Social Insurance Institute (INPS) are recognized as allocations to a deferred contribution plan inasmuch as the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions, other than those contemplated by Ministerial Decree of January 30, 2007, should the fund not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee service benefits.
Payables
Financial payables are stated at their nominal value, which approximates amortized cost. The book value of trade payables and other payables at the end of the reporting period approximates their fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Derivatives and Hedge Accounting

BasicNet Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk stems from bank borrowings, whilst foreign exchange risk stems from fluctuations in Euro/USD exchange rates on products purchased for resale, not covered by highly probable royalty and sourcing commission streams denominated in like-for-like currency.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially in the balance sheet at fair value and are measured, after initial recognition, according to the "hedging" or "non-hedging" designation required under IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

In connection thereto, BasicNet Group policy prohibits speculative transactions, and no trading activity in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.

There are two kinds of hedging relationships:



Fair value hedges



Cash flow hedges

To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. At the inception of the transaction, BasicNet Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.

After initial recognition, the following accounting treatment applies to derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting:

a) Fair value hedges

Changes in their fair value are recognized in the income statement, as are changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability. Fair value hedges are not used by the Group.

b) Cash flow hedges

The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in equity; the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in profit or loss. When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that remains recognized directly in equity from the period when the hedge was effective is recognized in profit or loss.

c) Derivative financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 are classified under financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting are not used by the Group.

Fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7
IFRS 7 requires financial instruments recognized at fair value to be classified on the basis of a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining fair value. The following levels are used in this hierarchy:
- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

59

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. as derived from prices). Classified herein are the financial instruments used by the Group to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest and/or exchange rates;
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). There are no financial instruments classified as such.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 The "Trademark License Management" segment delivered bolt-on revenues correlated to the business growth honed by unrelated licensees. Royalty income and sourcing commission, in particular, grew 11% from FY2010. Looking back to the year-earlier period, collected by the parent company from the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A. were FY2009-related dividends amounting to Euro 1.6 million, by virtue of which the net result delivered by this segment for FY 2010 surpasses the net result delivered for FY 2011.
 The "Proprietary Licensee" segment is represented by BasicItalia S.p.A. and by its subsidiaries RdK0 S.r.l., BasicOutlet S.r.l. and BasicCRS S.r.l., the related revenues of which retreated from Euro 131.7 million as at December 31, 2010 to Euro 121.5 million as at December 31, 2011, delivering a net result of Euro -6.1 million as compared to Euro -4.9 million in the year-ear-earlier period, due to the reasons examined and discussed in the Management Report.
 The "Property Operational Management" sector, which derives its revenues from the operational management of the Turin property complex at 1 Largo Maurizio Vitale, ends FY2011 delivering a positive net result in the amount of Euro 0.4 million, in line with the year before.

Direct sales revenue for the year under review relates to merchandize sold by BasicItalia S.p.A., by RdK0 S.r.l. and by BasicOutlet S.r.l., whether through National or Regional Servicing Centers or directly to the general public (Euro 121.7 million), as well as sample merchandize sold by BasicNet S.p.A. (Euro 0.2 million). Some 90.9% and approximately 4.9% of direct sales revenue was captured across the homeland and the EU, respectively, whilst the remainder, some 4.2%, was hiked across the rest of the world.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Goods purchased relate to merchandize purchased by BasicItalia S.p.A. The volume of purchases dipped meaningfully from the year before due to the merchandize procured by the Company at end 2010 being used over the course of 2011 to meet the demands for merchandize driven through by the bolder market footprint built up by the network of Group-banner shops and stores, with the attendant consequence being leaner merchandize stocks at end 2011. Samples purchased relate to samples purchased BasicNet S.p.A. for resale to Licensees.
Leaner purchasing volumes and inventory paved the way toward downsizing freight charges and accessory purchasing costs and, not least, trimming merchandize handling and stocking charges, as classified under "Other", as well as other product-related charges minor in amount .

10. ROYALTY INCOME AND SOURCING COMMISSION
Royalty income and Sourcing commission are represented by trademark royalty fees in the countries in which the relevant trademark property licenses have been assigned or recognized by authorized Sourcing Center licensees.

As at December 31, 2011, the balance on the line Other includes contributions (Euro 1 million) from licensees toward sponsorships put in place by the Group, sundry items recharged to unrelated parties, positive differences on accruals for expenses relative to prior periods, and other minor items of income.

The cost of labor (personnel expenses) includes all charges resulting from the services performed by BasicNet Group employees. Primarily pushing through the year-on-year increase was the increasing number of Group-banner shops and stores open for business across the homeland and some Parent Company operating structures being reinforced to mirror new-brand or design & prototyping development, with a keen eye steered toward building up the Fashion division to help the K-Way, Sabelt and Jesus Jeans brands to emerge stronger.

Service selling expenses relate primarily to commission recognized to agents of the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A., whilst Royalty expense relates to sports team merchandizing contracts and co-branding products. The year-on-year decline stems either from minor sales revenue delivered or the stronger stance taken by the sales revenue component developed by the Group-banner shops and stores on which lower rates of commission accrue.
By way of reflection of the increasing number of Group-banner shops and stores open for business to the general public, some of which operating as business line rentals, taking a stronger stance in the year under review were rental expense, accessory charges and utilities.
Commercial expenses include commercial-driven costs represented by product catalogue costs and, not least, trade-fair and exhibition showcasing costs, as well as communication consultancy costs represented by advertising campaign, styling, graphic and commercial costs and travel expenses; mainly priming the year-on-year reduction were communication expenses, which narrowed as a result of leaner advertising expenses and greater sponsorship costs being incurred in the review period, as placed in evidence earlier in Note 12.

Taken as a whole, the balance on debt servicing finance expenses as at December 31, 2011 increased by way of reflection of current net financial indebtedness, as set off in part by the reduction in the balance on medium to long-term loans and financing. Finance expenses also bear the brunt waged by gyrations in the spreads applied by the banking system. The balance on the net foreign exchange gain/(loss) reflects a substantially balanced stance as a result of the hedging transactions put in place, as examined and discussed in the Management Report.

17. INCOME TAXES
Income taxes relate to current income tax and deferred income tax in the amount of some Euro 2.6 million and some Euro 0.1 million, respectively.

18. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share at December 31, 2011 are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to owners of the Parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year:

Net Profit attributable to owners of the Parent Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share

There are no Ordinary Shares in issue for diluted earnings at December 31, 2011. Accordingly, diluted earnings per share coincide with basic earnings per share.
The year-on-year change in the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue for basic earnings reflects treasury share purchases put in place over the last twelve months.

As at December 31, 2011, intangible asset additions came to Euro 3.5 million with amortization recorded in the amount of Euro 2.6 million.
Concessions, trademarks and similar rights increased over the last twelve months. The year-on-year increase relates, in the amount of Euro 0.4 million, to the Sabelt brand (Fashion), acquired by underwriting 50% of Fashion S.p.A., the related titleholder thereto. The remainder relates to capitalization of the registration expenses incurred when filing trademarks in new European countries or when renewing or extending trademark filings already in place, as well as to expenses incurred in respect of software licenses. This item decreased over the last twelve months due to the effect of amortization for the period.
As acquired by the subsidiary Basic Trademark S.A. from the bankruptcy declared by MCT S.p.A., the Group's historic brands (Kappa and Robe di Kappa) reflect a net book value of Euro 3.7 million as at December 31, 2011. As at December 31, 2011, the Superga brand, helmed by the subsidiary Superga Trademark S.A., reflects a net book value of Euro 20.8 million; the K-Way brand, helmed by BasicNet S.p.A., reflects a net book value of Euro 5.8 million; the Sabelt brand, helmed by the Fashion S.p.A. joint venture, reflects a net book value of Euro 410 thousand; the Lanzera brand, helmed by the subsidiary Basic Properties America Inc., reflects a net book value of Euro 1.3 million; the AnziBesson brand, helmed by the AnziBesson Trademark S.r.l. joint venture, reflects a net book value of Euro 81 thousand.
With effect from 4Q2010, the Directors of the BasicNet Group have revisited the estimated useful lives of the Kappa, Robe di Kappa, Superga and K-Way "power brands", in application of International Accounting Standard IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, suspending on a forward-looking basis the related amortization thereof, unless there is an indication that the asset may be impaired, in which case, the amortization period is reassessed and, where applicable, changed.
Insofar as having still to reach the iconic status spiked by the "power brands", the Lanzera, Jesus, AnziBesson and Sabelt brands continue to be measured at the cost of purchase and are amortized over a period of twenty years.
On a basis consistent with the years before, the Group tests for impairment the recoverable amount of a brand at least once a year or whenever there is an indication that the brand might be impaired, discounting the net royalty flows that the brand may generate over a temporal horizon spanning three years, i.e. the medium-term horizon over which the revenues can be reliably measured. Estimated for the years thereafter is a terminal value determined on the royalty streams for the third year, without considering any growth rate. The flows have been discounted at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) rate of 7.6% (6.7% in 2010), as determined by reference to the following parameters, taken from key financial information sources (Bloomberg or Damodaran):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 Sector Beta: representing the sector risk indicator, this equates 1.09 (1 in 2010).  Market Risk Premium (MRP): this equates 5%, unchanged from the previous year, and represents the
difference between the yield rate for risk-free investments and the investment rate for at-risk investments.  Risk Free Rate (RFR): this equates 5.3% (4.3% in 2010), in line with the net yield rate for 10-year Treasury Bonds.  Cost of Debt: this equates some 4.2%, or the weighted average rate on Group financial indebtedness at December 31, 2011, unchanged from the previous year.  Ratio of Debt (40%) to Equity (60%), unchanged from the previous year.
Not emerging from the impairment test performed was any need to write down the carrying amount of the trademarks.
And lastly, as in the years before, the ultimate outcome of the impairment test performed was measured against the valuation reports issued by an expert advisor, which have always placed in evidence valuations broadly in excess of book carrying amounts.
Over the last twelve months, Computer-system programs moved forward some Euro 2.3 "million due to additions, and stepped back Euro 1.9 million due to the effect of amortization for the period.
Primarily encompassed within the balance on Other intangible assets are improvement costs arising from or relating to BasicNet Retail & Franchising Project developments. The movement for the year thereon reflects additions and amortization in the amount of Euro 0.4 million and Euro 0.5 million, respectively.

Encompassed within Goodwill is goodwill in the amount of Euro 6.7 million relating to the business line linked to Basic Spain S.L. Also encompassed therein, in the amount of Euro 1.2 million, is goodwill recognized in relation to the French market and, in the amount of Euro 4.9 million, paid goodwill (keymoney) in respect of retail commercial actives acquired. As placed in evidence in the table above, the movement for the year, attributable exclusively key-money, represents the net balance between additions for the period (Euro 281 thousand) and the write-downs recorded for impairment (Euro 242 thousand).
The Group tests for impairment the recoverable amount of goodwill at least once a year or whenever there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit constituting the smallest cash-generating unit.
Adopting the Unlevered Discounted Cash Flow model, the impairment test was performed as follows:
 the unlevered free cash flow received from the smallest cash-generating unit was discounted at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) rate of 7.6% (Note 19);

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 net financial debt, if any, and the value of the net assets of the smallest cash-generating unit, were deducted from the discounted cash flow. The value emerging therefrom was measured against book goodwill.
The ultimate outcome of the impairment test performed at December 31, 2011 was positive, without any need for write-downs being placed in evidence.
Having regard to items of key-money, the impairment test performed by comparing the related book value thereof, which mirrors the purchase price consideration paid by the Group, to the greater of their value in use, determined discounting the sales outlet cash flows at WACC (Note 19), and the fair value based on market conditions placed in evidence in the related expert appraisal reports. The impairment test led necessarily to the write-down, totaling Euro 242 thousand in amount, of commercial goodwill, in relation to 4 sales outlets. The write-down has been taken to Amortization (Note 15).

Change 178 178

As placed in evidence in the table below, the net amount of Euro 431 thousands represents the difference between the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities.
The deferred tax assets relate primarily to the following: provision to taxed reserve for the write-down of receivables (some Euro 5.2 million); provision to taxed reserve for the write-down of inventories (some Euro 1.5 million); provision generated by temporary differences arising on IFRS restatement (some Euro 4 million); unused interest surplus (Euro 1.6 million); unused tax losses (Euro 1.2 million), and; other minor items (Euro 0.6 million). Looking at the temporary differences arising from IRES restatement, Euro 2.1 million relate to adjustment recorded in respect of the fair value of the hedging instruments used to manage interest rate risk arising from medium-term financing. The deferred tax assets have been recognized because it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilized, also taking into account the national consolidation program adhered to by the following Group companies: BasicNet S.p.A., BasicItalia S.p.A., Basic Village S.p.A., RdK0 S.r.l., BasicOutlet S.r.l. and BasicCRS S.r.l.
The deferred tax liabilities relate to the tax effects arising on IFRS adoption, particularly with regard to the accounting for tax-deductible goodwill amortization (Euro 2.4 million), as well as to the provision for deferred taxes resulting from differences between depreciation and amortization for civil law purposes and tax-deductible items relative to the proprietary property of the subsidiary undertakings Basic Village S.p.A. and BasicItalia S.p.A. (Euro 6.5 million), other than the Euro 2.5 million referable to the provision for deferred taxes relative to the amortization of the trademarks whose useful economic life, as discussed earlier in Note 19, and, not least, to other minor items (Euro 0.4 million).
Derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges measured at fair value and recognized in other comprehensive income, result in the relative tax being recognized outside profit or loss (either in OCI or equity). As discussed in the preceding paragraph, the value of such tax equates Euro 0.7 million.

Encompassed within finished goods in inventory as at December 31, 2011 are merchandize-in-transit in the amount of some Euro 3.8 million (December 31, 2010: Euro 4.6 million) and merchandize at Groupbanner shops and stores in the amount of Euro 9.9 million (December 31, 2010: Euro 8 million).
Over the last twelve months, merchandize in inventory retreated some Euro 6.5 million as a result of ready-for-delivery merchandize held in stock being downsized, also by way of reflection of the merchandising demands posed by the growing number of Group-banner shops and stores scattered across the homeland.
Inventories are measured under the weighted average cost method and are stated on a net basis, i.e. net of the inventory write-down allowance deemed to be adequate based on a conservative ending inventory valuation. The following table sets out the movement for the year on the inventory write-down allowance:

As examined and discussed earlier in the Management Report, Trade receivables have been written down to their presumed realizable value (fair value based on market conditions) by recording an allowance (some Euro 5.7 million) for the write-down of bad and doubtful receivables (December 31, 2010: Euro 4.9 million). Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of receivable balances and historical experience. Individual trade receivables are provided against when Management deems them not to be recoverable.

Euro 11.7 million, in relation to the acquisition of the "Basic Village" property in Turin, and; in the amount of Euro 4.4 million, by the residual value attaching to the loan disbursed by Mediocredito Italiano S.p.A. (Gruppo Banca Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.) on October 29, 2008 in relation to the acquisition of the "BasicItalia" property.
Financing acquisition by the Group of the Superga trademark was the Euro 19 million syndicate loan, with a maximum 8-year maturity profile, and Unicredit Banca d'Impresa S.p.A. and Banca IntesaSanpaolo S.p.A., as Lead Arrangers. The Euro 19 million syndicate loan carries variable interest swapped into a fixed rate (Note 40), with maturity profile July 16, 2015. As at December 31, 2011, the Superga loan has been duly repaid in the amount of Euro 10.1 million, thereby reflecting a residual repayable balance in the amount of Euro 8.9 million, of which Euro 2.3 million repayable on the shorter term. By way of securing the loan taken out, guarantees have been given to the Lender Banks, including therein a lien pledged on 100% of the share capital of Superga Trademark S.A.
The Loan Facility Agreement provides for observance of the following financial ratios agreed by covenant and referable to the consolidated headline accounts of the BasicNet Group, all of which have been observed, as placed in evidence below:

 commitment to maintain, throughout the duration of the loan, the ratio of net financial position of the BasicNet Group to fair value of the proprietary trademarks of the Group companies consolidated lineby-line not more than 0.8, as broadly observed, moreover, as at December 31, 2011;
 commitment not to acquire treasury shares, unless specific waiver has been duly allowed, and not to put in place share capital reductions;
 other usage commitments associated with agreeing extraordinary business transactions or disposing of assets or contracting further forms of indebtedness associated with commercial activities extraordinary in nature.

Furthermore, the Loan Facility Agreement contemplates ongoing compliance with certain conditions relating to the proprietary control structure attaching to the share capital bases held by Basic World S.r.l. and BasicNet S.p.A. Contemplated more pointedly is the following:
 that Mr. Marco Daniele Boglione shall continue to hold (whether directly or indirectly), a 51% stake or more in the share capital of Basic World S.r.l., which, insofar as holding 36.187% of the shares of BasicNet S.p.A., is the stakeholder of reference;

82

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 that the aggregate stake held, whether directly or indirectly, by Basic World S.r.l. in the share capital of BasicNet S.p.A., shall not step back to 30% or less of the related share capital thereof or, in any case, by a stakeholding with power to cast the majority of votes of the Company; and
 that BasicNet S.p.A. shall continue to hold, whether directly or indirectly, a stakeholding equating 75% or more in the share capital of Superga Trademark S.A.
At the end of the reporting period, the commitment and conditions listed above have been observed without exception.
The medium to long-term loan provided by Gruppo Unicredit was disbursed in relation to the acquisition of the "Basic Village" property in Turin (1 Largo M. Vitale), previously held under finance lease. As disbursed part way September 2007 in the amount of Euro 18 million, the loan carries variable rates of interest swapped into fixed rates of interest (Note 40). By way of securing all this, the property has been mortgaged and sureties have been given by BasicNet S.p.A., the parent company.
The medium to long-term loan provided by Mediocredito Italiano S.p.A. (Gruppo Banca Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.) was disbursed in relation to the acquisition of the "BasicItalia" property in Turin (106 Strada Cebrosa), previously held under finance lease. As disbursed part way October 2009 in the amount of Euro 6 million, the loan carries variable interest pegged to EURIBOR at three months plus 230 base points, with the principal element being repayable on a straight-line basis under fifty-nine three-monthly installments. By way of securing all this, the property has been mortgaged and sureties have been given by BasicNet S.p.A., the parent company.

Encompassed within "Defined Benefit Plans" is the full liability due to employees of the Italian companies of the Group in accordance with Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code. As a result of pension reform law introduced in 2007, TFR allocations accrued prior to January 1, 2007 are accounted for as a defined benefit plan in conformity with IAS 19 ­ Employee Benefits; instead, those accruing thereafter are accounted for as a defined contribution plan.
Groupwide, there are no other forms of defined benefit plans.
As envisaged by IAS 19, the actuarial valuation of the `TFR' Provision is determined under the Projected Unit Credit Method. The Projected Unit Cost method is an actuarial valuation method that sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation, not projecting employee remuneration according to the changes introduced by the recently introduced by the Provident Reform Law.
Underscoring the `TFR' actuarial valuation model are demographic and financial assumptions, the more significant of which inherent to the cost of labor include:

This item reflects the adjustment to fair value of the hedging transactions entered into with primary financial counterparts to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on medium-term financing, i.e. Superga financing and BasicVillage financing (Note 32), with the attendant consequence being a cash flow hedge whereby the relevant variable rates of interest were swapped into fixed rates of interest set at 6.36% and 6.04%, respectively. Given currently prevailing money market conditions (EURIBOR), the adjustment equates Euro 213 thousand.
By way of corresponding entry, a negative equity reserve, equating Euro 1.6 million, less related tax effect, has been recognized.
Looking at the Interest Rate Swaps (IRSs) held by the Group, the variable cash flow streams are hedged at fair value based on market conditions, by entering into a Fix/Flo Interest Rate Swap mirroring perfectly the hedged item from which those streams draw origination, as always effective in the circumstances.

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In February 2010, Gruppo IntesaSanpaolo S.p.A. and BasicItalia S.p.A. reached an arrangement under which significant finance facilities may be accessed to start up franchised sales outlets flying the Group banner. Lodged in respect thereof was a guarantee deposit, the purpose of which is to guarantee a portion of the franchise finance made available under the arrangement referred to above and the sales outlet fittings financed under leasing arrangements. In turn, should the sales outlet lessee fail to repay the financing and/or leasing elements, BasicItalia S.p.A. shall be entitled by contract to take over the sales outlet in default. Lodged at December 31, 2011 was the deposit in the amount of Euro 331 thousand, of which Euro 245 thousand restricted by way of securing the first financing disbursed, whilst leasingrelated guarantees in the amount of Euro 2.2 million have been given.
By way of complement to the foregoing, set forth below are the other guarantees given by the Group in favor of unrelated parties:
 Euro 1.7 million: guarantees given by Bank and Lending Institutions in favor of lessees of the stores from which BasicItalia S.p.A., RdK0 S.r.l. and BasicOutlet S.r.l. conduct directly the sale and retail trading of Group branded products; and
 Surety provided by a primary bank group to secure the contractual commitments associated with a 7year technical sponsorship contract, for an annual amount growing from Euro 5.5 million in the first year to Euro 7 million in the seventh year. The guarantee contract inked by BasicNet S.p.A. in favor of the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A. provides for observance of the financial covenants relating to the ratio of net financial indebtedness to Group equity and the ratio of net financial indebtedness to Group EBITDA, as determined pursuant to contract, taking as benchmark measurement June 30th every year up to June 30, 2017. As referred to above, the ratios at June 30, 2011 have been observed without exception.
Also placed in evidence are other commitments undertaken by the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A., relating to the opening of import documentary credits, through a number of Banks and Lending Institutions, for an amount totaling Euro 16.9 million (December 31, 2010: Euro 14.3 million).
42. CLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

As identified under IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the financial risk factors are examined and discussed below:
 the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices ("market risk"). Market risk incorporates the following risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, and price risk:
a. the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices (other than changes determined by interest rate risk or currency risk), whether determined by specific factors linked to the financial instrument and/or relevant issuer or by factors affecting all the similar financial instruments traded on the market ("price risk");
b. the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in foreign currency rates of exchange ("currency risk");
c. the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates in different interest rate environments ("interest rate risk");
 the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group ("credit risk");
 the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets ("liquidity risk");
 the risk that the funding contracts entered into the Group companies contain covenants whereby the counterparties have the authority to require debtor to repay on demand the sums borrowed should certain events or circumstances crystallize, thereby giving rise to liquidity risk (" default risk").
Price risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices with regard to the raw materials (wool, cotton, rubber and synthetic fibers) incorporated in the finished goods that BasicItalia S.p.A. purchases across international markets, as well to the risk of fluctuations in oil prices that affect freight charges. The Group does not hedge its exposure to those risks, insofar as not handling directly the raw materials but only the finished goods. As such, the Group is exposed to that portion of price increases that cannot be transferred to end-consumers unless market conditions and competitive environment so permit.

BasicNet Group ­ Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Currency risk
BasicNet Group has contracted most of its financial instruments in Euro, which corresponds to its reporting and functional currency. Operating within an international environment, it is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations primarily in respect of the U.S. dollar/Euro rate of exchange.
Reported at December 31, 2011 are unrealized foreign exchange gains, net, in the amount of Euro 141 thousand, whilst unrealized foreign exchange losses, net, on foreign currency denominated open positions came to Euro 90 thousand, thereby resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of Euro 51 thousand (Note 16).
At the reporting date, the Group hedges its exposure to U.S. dollar fluctuations through two hedges, for an amount totaling US$ 5 million, at rates of exchange varying from 1.3925 to 1.405 U.S. dollars per Euro, the related purpose of which being to hedge the net balance of foreign denominated positions; the related positive effects resulting therefrom are reported under Financial instruments ­ Derivatives, as placed in evidence in Note 29.
Group management deems to be appropriate the policies adopted to manage or mitigate currency risk.
All the medium to long-term loans and financing and finance leases are denominated in Euro and, as such, are not subject to any currency risk.

Interest rate risk
As presented on a comparative basis with the year before, the table below sets out financial indebtedness, gross, as at December 31, 2011 analyzed by fixed and variable interest rate:

At fixed rate At variable rate
Financial indebtedness, Gross

December 31, 2011 % December 31, 2010 %

25,578 56,183
81,761

31.3% 68.7%
100.00%

As examined and discussed in Note 29 and Note 32, the Group manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations affecting certain medium to long-term loans and financing by swapping the variable rate into a fixed rate. As regards the remaining part of financial indebtedness, the Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations.
Interest expense on short-term credit line facilities is taken at the rate of 3.01% to 4.2%, depending upon the related typologies thereof as, moreover, placed in evidence in Note 35. Had the rates of interest on long-term loans and financing at December 31, 2011 been 100 base points higher (or lower) than the rates of interest effectively applied, the finance expenses reported in the income statement would have been Euro 189 thousand higher and Euro 189 thousand lower, respectively, gross of related tax effect.
Credit risk

The reserve for the write-down of receivables (Note 25), which includes provisions recorded to cover specific creditor positions and across-the-board provisions based on statistical analyses, accounts for some 10.3% of trade receivables as at December 31, 2011, in respect of losses that averaged in the past 2.8% of the receivables.

43. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions between parent company and its subsidiaries, or between the related subsidiary undertakings thereof, were put in place in the normal course of business, and were conducted at fair value based on market conditions, the related operating and financial effects of which are eliminated on consolidation. Based on the information received from the BasicNet Group companies, no atypical or unusual transactions have been put in place.
BasicNet S.p.A. and, insofar as consolidated, BasicItalia S.p.A., RdK0 S.r.l., BasicOutlet S.r.l., BasicCRS S.r.l. and Basic Village S.p.A. have adhered formally to the national tax consolidation program pursuant to Section 129 through Section 177 of the Italian Income Tax Code.

The fees comprise the emoluments and any other sum having a remunerative, provident or social security nature, due in respect of the Director or Statutory Auditor duties performed at BasicNet S.p.A. and at the other entities included line-by-line in the consolidation. Other related party transactions relate to legal advice proffered by the legal firm Studio Professionale Pavesio e Associati, led by Board Director Carlo Pavesio, a member of the legal profession, and, not least, to consultancy provided by Pantarei S.r.l., the Sole Director of which is Board Director Alessandro Gabetti Davicini. Not meaningful in terms of the overall amount involved, those transactions were concluded at fair value based on market conditions.

44. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE These are examined and discussed in the Management Report.
45. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES BasicNet Group is party to certain commercial disputes and litigation, the ultimate outcome of which is not expected to give rise to significant liabilities. The Tribunale di Milano (Court of Milan) in its decision dated February 29, 2012 sentenced the revocation of the K-Way® trademark purchase deed signed on January 31, 2004 with Formula Sport Group ("FSG") S.r.l. (the "Transaction"). The claim was brought - pursuant to Section 2901 of the Italian Civil Code and Section 66 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 - by the bankruptcy trustee (i.e. the official receiver) of FSG (in good standing at the time of the Transaction), notwithstanding the Transaction was entered into following an authorisation of the Court of Monza that expressly dismissed a bankruptcy claim against FSG subject to the entering of the Transaction. The judgement of the court of first instance declared the Transaction ineffective solely with respect to FSG. As a result, the proprietary title to the K-Way® trademark remains vested in BasicNet pending completion of all the legal remedies. The court pronounced its judgement in the wake of a judgement which the Company objected to and resolutely challenged the assumptions for the revocation claim by providing documentary and other evidence of the absence of prejudice to the creditors of FSG, also by taking into account the fairness of the purchase price consideration which was paid at the time. Consequently, it is the Company's strong belief that the judgement is based on erroneous reasoning and under various aspects is censurable, The Company also firmly believes - based on the opinions expressed by its legal advisors and consultants - that there are valid reasons, whether these are substantive or judicial, to consider that there are grounds to overturn the judgement on appeal and, as such, the related risk, if any, arising there from is deemed to be remote in nature. As part of its business activity, BasicNet and some Group companies are currently subject to tax reassessment, in respect of which no quantification can be made at the time of writing with regard to any factual findings.

SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

108

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The separate financial statements for 2011 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European Union (`Adopted IFRS'). The designation "IFRS" also includes all International Accounting Standards (IASs), whether revised or otherwise, and all Interpretations pronounced by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), formerly the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).
In application of Article 9.3 of Decree-Law 38 of February 28, 2005, also applied in the preparation of the separate financial statements were the requirements set forth in Consob Resolutions 15519 and 15520 issued by the Italian Regulatory Commission for Companies and the Stock Exchange ("Consob"), and Consob Communication 6064293 dated July 28, 2006.
The separate financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, modified to include the fair value measurement of certain financial instruments.
The accounting policies and measurement bases adopted in the preparation of the separate financial statements for 2011 are unchanged from the previous year.
2. FORMAT OF THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BasicNet S.p.A. (the `Company') presents an income statement in which expenses are classified by nature, whilst current and non-current assets, and current and non-current liabilities, are presented as separate classifications in its statement of financial position (balance sheet). The statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method. Taken into account when preparing the separate financial statements were the requirements of Consob Resolution 15519 of July 27, 2006 (format of the financial statements) and Consob Resolution 6064293 of July 28, 2006 (disclosures).
New Accounting Standards
Accounting Standards, Amendments and Interpretations effective from January 1, 2011 but not applicable to the Company:
 Amendment to IAS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation: Classification of Rights Issues denominated in Foreign Currency
 Amendment to IAS 24 - Related Party Disclosures. The amendment simplifies the type of disclosures required in the instance of State-owned related parties and clarifies the definition of related parties
 Amendment to IFRS 1 ­ First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendment consents simplifications to first-time adopters and provides guidance to entities in respect of changes in accounting policies in their first IFRS financial statements
 Guidance on IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements. This clarifies the disclosures to be presented in the statement of changes in equity
 Amendment to IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The amendment also requires additional disclosures in respect of classification and other matters
109

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Amendment to IFRIC 14 - Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement
 IFRIC 19 - Extinguishing Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments
 Annual Improvements to IAS/IFRS (2010).
New Standards and Amendments issued by the IASB and not early adopted by the Company:
- IFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. A new and comprehensive standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates, special purpose entities and other unconsolidated entities. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement. The new standard clarifies the determination of the fair value for the purpose of the financial statements and applies to all IFRSs permitting or requiring a fair value measurement or the presentation of disclosures based on fair value. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IAS 27 - Separate Financial Statements. As a result of the amended version of IFRS 10 being issued, the sphere of application of IAS 27 is confined to the separate financial statements, and only to the separate financial statements. Eliminated therefore from IAS 27 are all and any reference to the consolidated financial statements. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IAS 28 - Investments in Associates and Interests in Joint Ventures. The new standard sets out the accounting treatment for investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, as well the criteria in respect of the application of the equity method, and has been amended as a result of the amended versions of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 being issued. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
- IAS 19 - Employee Benefits. The amended version of IAS 19 eliminates the option to defer the recognition of gains and losses, known as the "corridor method", and introduces improvements to the disclosure to be provided in respect of defined benefit plans. The standard is effective for annual periods commencing on or after January 1 2013, with early adoption being permitted.
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The separate financial statements for 2011 have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting. The currency unit adopted is the Euro and all the amounts are rounded to the Euro unit.
Set forth below are the more significant accounting policies and measurement bases adopted in preparing the separate financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011:
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is shown net of trade discounts, volume rebates and product returns.
In particular, revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the enterprise has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, and the selling price has been agreed or determined and the collection of revenues is assured. In other words, revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the moment that legal title passes, which generally coincides with shipping or consignment.
110

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenue from royalties or from sourcing commission is recognized on an accrual basis in agreement with the substance of the underlying contracts.
Cost/Expense Recognition
Costs and expenses are accounted for in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting.
Costs relating to the preparation and presentation of sample collections are dealt with through the income statement in the period in which the relevant sample collection sales are collected. Deferral, if any, is recognized through deferred expenses.
Interest Income and Interest Expense, Income and Expenses
Interest income and interest expense are matched on an accrual basis, using a method that approximates the effective interest rate. Other income and expenses are recognized on a matching basis.
Dividends
Dividends receivable Dividends receivable from investees are recognized in the income statement in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.
Dividends payable Dividends payable are reported as a movement in equity in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Translation Criteria for Balances Denominated in Foreign Currency
Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency are converted into Euro at the respective rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the original transaction. The exchange differences realized on the collection of receivables or payment of liabilities are dealt with through the income statement.
Income and revenue, and costs and expenses relating to transactions denominated in foreign currency are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the original transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency at the end of the reporting period are reported at the forward contract rate prevailing at that date, and the related foreign exchange gains or losses are dealt with through the income statement.
Income Taxes
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Company. Taxes on income are recognized in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items directly charged or credited to equity, in which case the related income tax effect is recognized directly in equity.
Other taxes not based on income, such as property tax and capital tax, are included in operating expenses. Deferred taxes are calculated on all temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, excepting those arising from goodwill not tax deductible or resulting from investments in subsidiaries where their reversal will not take place in the foreseeable future.
111

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses and tax credits, as well as those arising from temporary differences, are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future profits will be available against which they can be utilized. In accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 12.71, current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right of offset.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the substantively enacted tax rates hat are expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which temporary differences will be reversed.
With effect from fiscal 2006, BasicNet S.p.A. and its Italian subsidiaries elected to adhere, for the threeyear period, to the National Tax Consolidation program pursuant to Article 117 et seq. of Italian Presidential Decree (DPR) 917 of December 22, 1986; over the course of FY2009, the program elected was renewed for the three-year period 2009, 2010 and 2011.
BasicNet S.p.A. acts as the tax consolidating entity in this program and determines a single taxable base for the grouping of companies taking part, thereby enabling benefits to be realized from the offsetting of taxable income and tax losses in a single tax return. Each company adhering to national tax consolidation transfers its taxable income or tax loss to the tax consolidating entity. BasicNet S.p.A. recognizes receivables from companies contributing taxable incomes, corresponding to the amount of `Ires' corporate income tax paid on its behalf. Conversely, whenever a company brings a tax loss into the national tax consolidation, BasicNet S.p.A. recognizes a payable to that company for the amount of the loss effectively set off at the Group level.
Earnings Per Share
As required by IAS 33.4, Earnings Per Share are presented solely at the consolidated financial statement level.
Contingent Liabilities
Through the normal course of business, the Company may be involved in tax and legal disputes covering a range of matters in various jurisdictions, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Group. Due to the uncertainty attaching thereto, it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters. Furthermore, the Company is party to legal disputes defending its premium brands and/or products from imitation and falsification. The cases and claims against the Company frequently raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to a broad spectrum of uncertainties and complexities, including but not limited to the facts and circumstances relative to each particular case and claim, the jurisdiction and differences in applicable law.
In the normal course of business, Management consults with legal counsel and advisors on litigation and tax matters. Provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs, including related legal costs, can be estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate disclosures are included in the Notes to the separate financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Separate Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used to measure the intangible assets and the items of property, plant and equipment tested for impairment as discussed further ahead and, not least, to report allowances for doubtful accounts, obsolete inventories, depreciation and amortization, assets written down, employee benefits, taxation, other provisions and reserves.
112

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of all changes are reflected immediately in the income statement.
Intangible Assets
As required by IAS 38, intangible assets, whether purchased or internally generated, are recognized if, and only if, they meet the definition of an intangible asset (identifiability, control over a resource, and evidence of future economic benefits that will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably).
Intangible assets with a definite useful life are recognized at purchase price or production cost, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life.
Software Purchased software and internally generated computer-system programs are amortized over five years. Software costs incurred in maintaining or restoring the originally assessed standard of performance are recognized as an expense as and when incurred, and are not capitalized.
Development Costs Development costs are capitalized when it can be demonstrated that the development expenditure will generate probable future economic benefits and the other conditions required under IAS 38 are satisfied.
Trademarks and Patents Given the bolder reach carved out around the globe by the Kappa brand and the resultant royalty stream iconic status earned and, not least, given that no deterrents were believed to exist that would limit the generation of cash flows over the longer horizon, the Directors of the BasicNet Group reassessed in 4Q2010 the brand's useful economic life insofar as retaining this to be no longer properly reflected by the previously adopted 20-year amortization period. As examined and discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, also reassessed on that occasion were the other "power brands" held by the BasicNet Group, inasmuch as these:
 play a priority role in terms of Company strategy and Group strategy;
 the Group's framework is strongly correlated to and dependent upon Brand development and Brand awareness across the market landscape;
 the Group proprietary brands are registered and legally safeguarded by trademark protection;
 on a comparative basis with the related cash flows resulting therefrom, trademark protection and filing costs are not meaningful;
 the nature of the branded products commercialized by the Group is that technological obsolescence is not a common issue.
Accordingly, with effect from 4Q2010, the parent company revisited the estimated useful life of the KWay brand, in application of International Accounting Standard IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, suspending on a forward-looking basis the related amortization thereof, all of which without prejudice to impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in the carrying amount.
Patent rights are amortized over a period of ten years.

NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other Intangible Assets
If the cost (i.e. fair value) of an intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination that is an acquisition can be measured reliably, that asset is recognized as a separate intangible asset and not included in goodwill.

Goodwill
In the instance of a business combination that is an acquisition, the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. The positive difference between the cost of the business combination over the Company's share of the fair values of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is classified as goodwill and included in the accounts under intangible assets. Conversely, any negative difference ("negative goodwill") is recognized immediately in the income statement.
Insofar as not amortized, goodwill is assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. After initial recognition, goodwill is carried at its cost less any cumulative impairment losses.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are tangible fixed assets, and are stated at purchase price or production cost. Cost includes accessory expenses, as well as the portion of direct and indirect costs which can be reasonably attributed to the assets.
Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment that has already been recognized is added to the carrying amount of the asset if, and only if, the future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset, will flow to the entity. All other subsequent expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of the assets on a straight-line basis over their useful life expectancy, as follows:

PPE
Plant and machinery Furniture, fittings and fixtures Motor vehicles Electronic and electric machinery

Useful life expectancy (in years) 8
5 to 8
4
5 to 8

The assets are written down to reflect any impairment, other than temporary, in value at the end of the reporting period. If, in subsequent periods, the reasons for the write-down cease to apply, the original value is reinstated.
Ordinary maintenance costs are charged wholly against the income statement.
Payments on account and assets under construction, as yet not entered into service at the end of the reporting period, are shown separately.

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Assets held under lease Land and buildings held under finance lease are accounted for under the finance method. The asset is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset, and is depreciated over its estimated useful life.
The depreciation provided on the assets is reflected in the annual separate financial statements in the same way as other items of property, plant and equipment.
The obligation related to finance leases, net of financial charges, in respect of future periods, are included, as appropriate, under current liabilities or non-current liabilities. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance on the obligation for each accounting period.
Impairment of Assets
The carrying amount of the assets held by the Company are tested for impairment at the end of each reporting period to assess whether there is any indication of impairment other than temporary, in which case the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. If this is the case, the impairment loss is assessed and recognized as an expense in the income statement when the carrying amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is greater than the recoverable amount of the asset to which it relates. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including therein goodwill, are assessed annually, or whenever an indication of impairment is identified.
Measurement of Recoverable Amount
The recoverable amount of an asset other than a financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In measuring value in use, the estimated future cash flows are actualized applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets. Should an asset not generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of those from other assets, value in use and, therefore, recoverable amount, can be determined only for the asset's cash-generating unit.
Reversal of an Impairment Loss
An impairment loss recognized for an asset other than goodwill in prior years is reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is recognized as income immediately in the income statement, adjusting the carrying amount of the asset to its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset other than goodwill is not increased above the lower of the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortization or depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.
Investments and Other Financial Assets
In the separate financial statements of BasicNet S.p.A., investments are carried at cost plus directly attributable accessory expenses. Where objective evidence exists that an investment may be impaired, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount, represented by the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
115

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Inasmuch as no investments quoted in an active market are held, fair value is determined exclusively by reference to a binding sale agreement.
Value in use is generally determined to the extent of the corresponding fraction of the investee's net equity taken from the consolidated financial statements, plus the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the operations of investments and, where significant and reasonably determinable, those from its ultimate disposal after deducting the estimated costs of disposal. The cash flows determined are based upon reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate of the range of future economic conditions that will exist. These are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted (i.e. WACC). If the Company's share of losses of the investee exceeds the carrying amount of the investment and if the Company has a legal, contractual or implicit obligation or intends to respond for those losses, the Company's interest is reduced to zero and a liability is recognized for its share of the additional losses. If, in subsequent periods, the impairment loss no longer exists, it is reversed and the reversal is recognized in the income statement up to the limit of the cost of the investment.
Under IAS 36.12(h), the distribution by an investee of reserves formed out of earnings represents an event that may indicate that the carrying amount of the investee may be impaired and, as such, requires the related recoverable amount thereof to be determined.
Subsidiaries
Control by the Company exists when it has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Associates
As associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, over which significant influence is exercised and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Where 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the voting power of an investee is held, significant influence is presumed to exist, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case.
Other enterprises
Other enterprises are entities in which less than 20 per cent of the voting power of an investee is held.
Other financial assets
Receivables classified under financial fixed assets are stated at their presumed realizable value.
Net Inventory
Inventories are measured under the weighted average cost method of valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of production or purchase price or net realizable value based on market conditions. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs directly and indirectly attributable to bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Inventory writedowns are written back in subsequent periods if the reasons for the write-down cease to apply. Obsolete and slow-moving inventories are written down on the basis of their possible utilization or saleability. If, in subsequent periods, the reasons for the write-down cease to apply, the original value is reinstated.

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Receivables and Other Current Assets
Receivables classified under current assets are stated at their nominal value, which substantially coincides with amortized cost.
Trade receivables are written down to their presumed realizable value through a reserve for the writedown of bad and doubtful receivables. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Individual trade receivables are provided against when management deems them not to be collectable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. These are stated in the amounts effectively available at the end of the reporting period. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Accruals and Prepayments
Accruals and prepayments include the portion of revenues and expenses covering two or more periods, in
accordance with the accrual basis of accounting.
Treasury Shares
Treasury shares are presented as a deduction from equity. The original cost of treasury shares and the proceeds of any subsequent sale are presented as movements in equity.
Reserves for Risks and Charges
Reserves for risks and charges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet if, and only if, there is an implicit or legal obligation that should result in an outflow from the enterprise of resources embodying economic benefits, and a reliable estimation thereof can be determined.
Employee Benefits
Employee benefits that fall within the scope of Italy's TFR (provision for severance pay) are considered defined post-employment benefits and are therefore measured on an accrual basis using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
With effect from January 1, 2007, such liability relates exclusively to the TFR allocations accrued up to December 31, 2006, which, by virtue of the pension reform (establishment of a supplementary pension fund) introduced by the government (Italian legislative decree no. 252 of December 5, 2005), continues to represent an obligation for the entity. As a result of such reform being incorporated into Italian law by virtue of Law No. 296 of December 27, 2006 (Italian Financial Act 2007), the liability, insofar as relating to past service costs, has been remeasured without applying the pro-rated service worked and without reflecting, in the actuarial computation, the material element of estimated future salary increases. The TFR allocations paid into supplementary pension funds represent a form of deferred contribution plan under which the entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Additionally, the TFR
117

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

allocations transferred to the special TFR fund managed by the National Social Insurance Institute (INPS) are recognized as allocations to a deferred contribution plan inasmuch as the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions, other than those contemplated by Ministerial Decree of January 30, 2007, should the fund not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee service benefits.

Payables
Financial payables are stated at their nominal value, which approximates amortized cost. The book value of trade payables and other payables at the end of the reporting period approximates their fair value.

Derivatives and Hedge Accounting

BasicNet S.p.A. uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on certain loans and financing.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized initially in the balance sheet at fair value and are measured, after initial recognition, according to the "hedging" or "non-hedging" designation required under IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

In connection thereto, BasicNet policy prohibits speculative transactions, and no trading activity in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.

Hedging relationships are two in kind:



Fair value hedges



Cash flow hedges

To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. At the inception of the transaction, the BasicNet Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.

After initial recognition, the following accounting treatment applies to derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting:

a) Fair value hedges

Changes in their fair value are recognized in the income statement, as are changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability. Fair value hedges are not used by the Group.

b) Cash flow hedges

The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in equity; the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in profit or loss. When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that remains recognized directly in equity from the period when the hedge was effective is recognized in profit or loss.
c) Derivative financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 are classified under financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7
IFRS 7 requires financial instruments recognized at fair value to be classified on the basis of a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in determining fair value.

118

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following levels are used in this hierarchy: - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. as derived from prices). Classified herein are the financial instruments used by the Group to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest and/or exchange rates. - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). There are no financial instruments classified as such. 4.

Interest income-intragroup stems from operations put in place over the last twelve months and governed by intragroup accounts, remunerated at market rates. Primarily pushing through the year-on-year increase was greater interest debited to BasicItalia S.p.A. on the current account balance due to interest rate increases. The year-on-year increase in the balance on interest expense-banks is correlated to greater average exposure to the banking system, arising from or related to Group treasury management, as well as well as to the interest rate increases spiked over the course of the year under review.
Interest expense on medium to long-term financing relates to the syndicate loan taken out part way July 2007 in relation to the acquisition of the Superga trademark by the Group and, not least, to the financing contracted in relation to the K-Way trademark acquisition. The year-on-year decrease on this line reflects the progressive repayment of the financings referred to above. The K-Way financing had been extinguished by December 31, 2010.
As at December 31, 2011, realized foreign exchange gains and realized foreign exchange losses amount to Euro 143 thousand and Euro 186 thousand, respectively. Amounting to Euro 96 thousand, unrealized foreign exchange gains arise from conversion of debtor and creditor positions at the respective year-end rates of exchange, whilst unrealized foreign exchange losses amount to Euro14 thousand.

8,710,261

As at December 31, 2011, intangible asset additions came to Euro 1.6 million with amortization recorded in the amount of Euro 1.2 million. No intangible asset disposals are placed in evidence.
Concessions, trademarks and similar rights increased over the last twelve months due to registration expenses incurred when filing the K-Way trademark in new European counties or when renewing or extending K-Way trademark filings already in place (Euro 52 thousand) and, not least, expenses incurred in respect of software licenses purchased (Euro 69 thousand). As at December 31, 2011, the net book value of the K-Way trademark was Euro 5.8 million. Trademark filing or renewed trademark filing expenses added to the relevant brand.
As in prior years, the recoverable amount of a brand is tested for impairment at least once a year or whenever there is an indication that the brand might be impaired, discounting the net royalty flows that the brand may generate over a temporal horizon spanning three years, i.e. the medium-term horizon over which the revenues can be reliably measured. Estimated for the years thereafter is a terminal value determined on the royalty streams for the third year, normalized considering a growth rate of 3%. The flows have been discounted at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) rate of 7.6% (6.7% in 2010), as determined by reference to the following parameters, taken from key financial information sources (Bloomberg):
 Sector Beta: representing the sector risk indicator, this equates 1.09 (1 in 2010).  Market Risk Premium (MRP): unchanged from the previous year, this equates 5% and represents the
difference between the yield rate for risk-free investments and the investment rate for at-risk investments.  Risk Free Rate (RFR): this equates 5.3% (4.3% in 2010), in line with the net yield rate for 10-year Treasury Bonds.  Cost of Debt: unchanged from the previous year, this equates some 4.2% or the weighted average rate on Group financial indebtedness at December 31, 2011.  Unchanged from the previous year, the Ratio of Debt (40%) to Equity (60%).
No evidence of the need to write down the carrying amount of the trademark emerged on impairment testing. The same conclusion was reached when applying the perpetual yield model to the average of royalty income and sourcing commission streams over the last three years (year 2011 included). And lastly, as in the years before, the ultimate outcome of the impairment test was measured against the valuation reports issued by an expert advisor, which, as always, placed in evidence valuations broadly in excess of book amounts.

Analysis of the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries can be found in Exhibit #1.
After reviewing the financial performance of the investee BasicItalia S.p.A., the Board of Directors of BasicNet S.p.A. passed resolution on April 29, 2011 approving the recapitalization of the subsidiary, in order to support the economic and financial investments associated with the programmed reshaping of the distribution network, making available in favor thereof an amount of Euro 6.5 million, utilizing funds already paid into the subsidiary's coffers.
On a basis consistent with the practices adopted by other listed major groups across the national landscape, BasicNet S.p.A. identifies as an indication that an impairment loss may have occurred if the carrying amount of a subsidiary in the separate financial statements exceeds the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the investee's net assets.
As assessed in respect of all the subsidiaries, emerging therefrom was the need to test for impairment the carrying amount of the investment in the subsidiary BasicItalia S.p.A.
The recoverability of the carrying amount of the investee was tested for impairment by comparing such carrying amount with its value in use. Value in use was determined by discounting the net cash flows received from BasicItalia S.p.A. and its subsidiaries, as resulting from the Business Plan for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 at WACC (Note 18), less aggregate net financial indebtedness of the BasicItalia sub-grouping.

BasicNet S.p.A. ­ Separate Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All of this led to a write-down being recorded to reflect investee impairment in the amount of Euro 4.5 million, as placed in evidence earlier in Note 16.
Currently in progress are step-actions steered toward BasicItalia S.p.A. regaining a more profitable stance, the related effects of which might not be immediate. As a consequence, an infusion of capital by the majority stakeholder may not be excluded.
The increase for the year in investments in joint ventures unfolds from the 50% stake underwritten, with effect from October 3, 2011, in the share capital of Fashion S.p.A., the titleholder to the Sabelt brand. Also encompassed within investments in joint ventures is the 50% stake underwritten in the quota capital of AnziBesson Trademark S.r.l., acquired in 2010.
Receivables from joint ventures relate to venturer funding in favor of AnziBesson Trademark S.r.l.
Other receivables relate to guarantee deposits.

21. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
Deferred tax assets have been recognized in the amount of Euro 471 thousand, less deferred tax liabilities, relative to the valorization of the results delivered for the period and in relation to estimated future amounts.

The `TFR' Provision covers the full liability due to employees of the Italian companies of the Group in accordance with Section 2120 of the Italian Civil Code. As a result of pension reform law introduced in 2007, TFR allocations accrued prior to January 1, 2007 are accounted for as a defined benefit plan in conformity with IAS 19 ­ Employee Benefits; instead, those accruing thereafter are accounted for as a defined contribution plan.
Company-wide, there are no other form of defined benefit plans.
As required under IAS 19, the actuarial valuation of the `TFR' Provision is determined under the Projected Unit Credit Method. The Projected Unit Cost method is an actuarial valuation method that sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation, not projecting employee remuneration according to the changes introduced by the recently introduced by the Provident Reform Law.
Underscoring the `TFR' actuarial valuation model are demographic and financial assumptions, the more significant of which include:

This item reflects the adjustment to fair value of the hedges used to mitigate the Company's exposure to interest rate risk arising from the Superga medium-term financing (Note 28), taken out with Unicredit Banca d'Impresa S.p.A. and Banca Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., with the attendant consequence being a cash flow hedge whereby the relevant variable rates of interest were swapped into fixed rates of interest set at 6.36% p.a.
By way of corresponding entry, a negative equity reserve, equating Euro 414 million, less related tax effect, has been recognized. Looking at the Interest Rate Swaps (IRSs) held by the Company, the cashflow streams are hedged at fair value based on market conditions, by entering into a Fix/Flo Interest Rate Swap mirroring perfectly the hedged item from which those streams draw origination, as deemed to be always effective in the case under review.
The fair value risk to which Fix/Flo IRS users are exposed is not meaningful.

S.p.A. (Gruppo Banca Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.) in favor of BasicItalia S.p.A. in respect of the loan taken
out in relation to the acquisition of the "BasicItalia" property: in the amount of Euro 7 million, to the guarantee, given by a primary bank, by way of securing contractual commitments arising from or relating to a technical sponsorship contract, and; the remainder relates, in the amount of Euro 41.5 million, to guarantees given to differing banks and lending institutions in favor of BasicItalia S.p.A. by way of securing commercial credit line facilities.

As referred to above, the ratios at June 30, 2011 have been observed without exception.

As identified under IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the financial risk factors are examined and discussed below:
 the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices ("market risk"). Market risk incorporates the following risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, and price risk;
 the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in foreign currency rates of exchange ("currency risk");
 the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in interest rates in different interest rate environments ("interest rate risk");
 the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices (other than changes determined by interest rate risk or currency risk), whether determined by specific factors linked to the financial instrument and/or relevant issuer or by factors affecting all the similar financial instruments traded on the market ("price risk");
 the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group ("credit risk"); and;
 the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets ("liquidity risk").
Price risk
The Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices with regard to the raw materials (wool, cotton, rubber and synthetic fibers) incorporated in the finished goods that it purchases across international markets for resale to Licensees. The Company does not hedge its exposure to those risks, insofar as not handling directly the raw materials but only the finished goods and, moreover, the fluctuations can be transferred in the selling prices of the samples.

NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Currency risk
BasicNet S.p.A. has contracted most of its financial instruments in Euro, which corresponds to its reporting and functional currency. Operating within an international environment, it is subject to currency risk arising from foreign exchange rate movements versus the Euro. Reported at December 31, 2011 are foreign exchange losses in the amount of Euro 43 thousand, whilst unrealized foreign exchange gains, net, on foreign currency denominated open positions came to Euro 83 thousand, thereby resulting in a net foreign exchange gain in the amount of Euro 40 thousand (Note 14). Exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations are hedged at the Group level.
Interest rate risk
As presented on a comparative basis with the year before, the table below sets out financial indebtedness, gross, as at December 31, 2010 analyzed by fixed and variable interest rate:

At fixed rate At variable rate
Financial indebtedness, Gross

December 31, 2011
9,022,684 6,764,744 15,787,428

%
57.2% 42.8% 100.0%

11,428,734 5,762,336
17,191,070

%
66.5% 33.5% 100.0%

Exposures to interest rate fluctuations affecting certain medium to long-term loans and financing are managed by swapping the variable rate into a fixed rate, as examined and discussed in Note 28 and Note 36. As regards the remaining part of financial indebtedness, the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations.
Interest expense on short-term credit line facilities is taken at the rate of 3.9%, depending on the related typologies thereof as, moreover, placed in evidence in Note 31. Had the rates of interest on long-term loans and financing at December 31, 2011 been 100 base points higher (or lower) than the rates of interest effectively applied, the finance expenses reported in the income statement would have been Euro 100 thousand higher and Euro 100 thousand lower, respectively.
Credit risk

The reserve for the write-down of receivables (Note 23), which includes provisions recorded in respect of specific creditor positions and across-the-board provisions based on statistical analyses, accounts for some 7.1% of trade receivables as at December 31, 2011, as set aside to cover losses that averaged over the last three-year period 0.44% of the receivables.

Liquidity risk
Treasury is managed at the Group level. Taken as a whole, the credit line facilities made available to the Group by the banking industry, as discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, is deemed to be adequate to avoid financial tension risk.

Default risk and financial debt covenant
Default risk refers to the risk that the funding contracts entered into by the Group companies contain covenants whereby the counterparties have the authority to require debtor repay on demand the sums borrowed should certain events or circumstances crystallize, thereby giving rise to liquidity risk.
The covenants are referable to Group operating and financial consolidated data and are analyzed and discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

39. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The fees comprise the emoluments and any other sum having a remunerative, provident or social security nature, due in respect of the Director or Statutory Auditor duties performed at BasicNet S.p.A. and at the other entities included line-by-line in the consolidation. Other related party transactions relate to legal advice proffered by the legal firm Studio Professionale Pavesio e Associati, led by Board Director Carlo Pavesio, a member of the legal profession, and, not least, to consultancy provided by Pantarei S.r.l., the Sole Director of which is Board Director Alessandro Gabetti Davicini. Not meaningful in terms of the overall amount involved, those transactions were concluded at fair value based on market conditions.

40. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Tribunale di Milano (Court of Milan) in its decision dated February 29, 2012 sentenced the revocation of the K-Way® trademark purchase deed signed on January 31, 2004 with Formula Sport Group ("FSG") S.r.l. (the "Transaction"). The claim was brought - pursuant to Section 2901 of the Italian Civil Code and Section 66 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 - by the bankruptcy trustee (i.e. the official receiver) of FSG (in good standing at the time of the Transaction), notwithstanding the Transaction was entered into following an authorisation of the Court of Monza that expressly dismissed a bankruptcy claim against FSG subject to the entering of the Transaction. The judgement of the court of first instance declared the Transaction ineffective solely with respect to FSG. As a result, the proprietary title to the K-Way® trademark remains vested in BasicNet pending completion of all the legal remedies. The court pronounced its judgement in the wake of a judgement which the Company objected to and resolutely challenged the assumptions for the revocation claim by providing documentary and other evidence of the absence of prejudice to the creditors of FSG, also by taking into account the fairness of the purchase price consideration which was paid at the time. Consequently, it is the Company's strong belief that the judgement is based on erroneous reasoning and under various aspects is censurable, The Company also firmly believes - based on the opinions expressed by its legal advisors and consultants - that there are valid reasons, whether these are substantive or judicial, to consider that there are grounds to overturn the judgement on appeal and, as such, the related risk, if any, arising there from is deemed to be remote in nature.
As part of its business activity, BasicNet is currently subject to tax reassessment, in respect of which no quantification can be made at the time of writing with regard to any factual findings.
